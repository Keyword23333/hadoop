1220008 evaluasi belajar melalui ujian nasional un itu hanya melahirkan kecemasan dan frustrasi di kalangan pelajar kami minta kepada pemerintah agar un ditinjau ulang
1220009 pendidikan sekarang cenderung semakin mahal dari tingkat dasar hingga pendidikan tinggi praktik ini terjadi tidak hanya di sekolah swasta tetapi juga negeri di desa dan kota kami menuntut pemerintah memperbesar subsidi pendidikan bagi warga tidak mampu
1220010 kepekaan terhadap dunia pendidikan dirasa masih kurang dengan munculnya berbagai kebijakan kontroversial seperti ujian nasional diabaikannya ketentuan anggaran pendidikan 20 persen dan ruu badan hukum pendidikan
1220011 selama ini seperti saling bertentangan masyarakat ingin pendidikan murah tetapi kebijakan pemerintah malah sebaliknya cenderung mendorong makin mahalnya pendidikan
1220012 kekuasaan negara waktu itu orde baru mencangkok semua lembaga seperti ipm
1220013 bahkan pelajar tidak ada gaungnya sama sekali maka kami berharap adanya ipm kini akan difokuskan untuk kepentingan pelajar
1220014 kini ramadhan dipandang sebagai ajang entertaint dan dijual dengan beragam cara untuk kepentingan pemilik modal yang mengakibatkan lunturnya esensi ramadhan
1220015 kami menghimbau kepada para tokoh islam untuk berhenti berceramah dengan tidak proporsional
1220016 oleh karenanya pp irm menghimbau kepada seluruh remaja islam untuk melakukan kegiatan yang positif dalam mengisi bulan ramadhan seperti dengan mengembangkan budaya gemar membaca sehingga muncul kesibukan baru yang dapat mengalihkan perhatian remaja dari tayangan komersial ramadhan
1220017 kedua gerakan tersebut kami nilai sebagai jalan agar masyarakat mampu emnjalankan puasa degan khusuk
1220018 meski tayangan sinetron dikemas dengan konsep cerita relijius sebenarnya tayangan tersebut justru menjauhkan masyarakat dari ajaran agama yang menjadi kewajibannya banyaknya sinetron selama bulan puasa justru merupakan instrumen yang dibuat kaum borjuis untuk melupakan roh bulan ramadan
1220019 pada bulan mencari berkah bukannya diisi dengan siraman rohani malah kebanjiran sinetron yang tidak mendidik padahal sebelum puasa jarang stasiun televisi memutar tayangan yang berbau relijius tetapi ini trik mereka untuk mendapatkan pendapatan iklan hal inilah yang kami sebut sebagai komersialisasi puasa
1220020 ini tidak lain adalah hasil persengkokolan kaum borjuis dengan mengatasnamakan ibadah konsep yang disebarluaskan ngabuburit atau menlihat konser musik adalah budaya sehari hari selama puasa bukankah tidak lebih baik mengisi waktu dengan hal yang berbau ibadah

1220053 the top people should be booted out and replaced by executives who have the confidence of the markets
1220054 this company has to answer to shareholders to our regulator and to congress and those groups often demand completely contradictory things
1220055 sure its hard to deal with the pressures of congress and shareholders and regulators
1220056 but thats why executives get paid so much its not acceptable to blame those pressures for making bad choices

1220061 the previous government had established a 30 percent of gdp target when the fiscal responsibility act was passed in 1994 and had reduced it to 25 percent in 1999 when we came into office that year we made the judgement that the crown finances and the state of the economy could not sustain that lower target so we restored it to 30 percent of gdp
1220062 i am pleased that economic growth has produced enough tax revenue to declare a surplus and repay debt but i am appalled at the rate at which debt repayment is occurring at the expense of families and schools and other essential social and public services
1220063 the government is putting an undue emphasis on debt repayment at the expense of our failing services and infrastructure in new zealand
1220064 we agree that we should be aiming to ensure that the ratio of debt to gdp in new zealand is not out of line with other smaller industrialised countries but labour does not accept that having the smallest debt to gdp ratio in the oecd is an important goal nor do we believe that reducing our debt quickly should take precedence over improving the living standard
1220065 at budget time our net public debt was equivalent to 42 per cent of gdp down from 48 per cent a year earlier given those figures it is hard to believe that the international credit rating agencies with which the government is so besotted can have any real concern at our current level of debt
1220066 the government is obsessed with debt reduction over all other needs for spending

1220131 tottenham offered us about 20 million euros for arshavin but this amount is not nearly enough for us to accept it
1220132 if liverpool is prepared to pay spurs 18 million for robbie keane then spurs should expect to pay zenit a reasonable fee for arshavin

1220136 we will shortly be back to profitability thain told cnbc in his first public comments since the firm raised us 9 8 billion in a share sale last week he declined to be specific about when the new york based firm would end the losses
1220137 we had negotiated a trade waiting until january certainly ran the risk to us that these assets continued to deteriorate in value and that they caused further losses
1220138 this is the first big trade in the cdo market thain said
1220139 there really has been no liquidity until now theres no question this price was a bulk sale price
1220140 it puts us in a much better position to manage our business going forward
1220141 today thain said that might change if prices for the firms assets which include subprime mortgages drop further
1220142 we are much smaller in terms of risky assets but its not zero thain said
1220143 if asset values continue to fall particularly mortgage assets we still have some exposure
1220144 the us economy is going to continue to be weak he said
1220145 if you look at the combination of falling home prices rising unemployment high energy prices both gasoline and however you heat your home and rising food prices all of those are going to make difficult for the consumer all of which i think makes the us economy slow at least until sometime next year

1220177 riding bicycles if we would get these cities to put up viable walking paths so many of these things that are out there to change the global warming trend are opportunities for all families to become healthier and save money
1220178 what would happen instead if we were able to convince the power company to help people conserve energy in their own homes even pay them or give them money to buy a new refrigerator that replaces an old inefficient one and they would pay it off in savings on their electric bill
1220179 what would happen if instead of investing in a new power plant we had local workers installing insulation and water heater blankets and fluorescent bulbs
1220180 were trying to stay out of politics and then take advantage of the good lessons of being environmental stewards
1220181 i dont think anyone can argue with conserving energy and not littering

1220233 what does it take to succeed a positive attitude well sure but thats hardly enough the law of attraction the secret these ideas might act as spurs to action but without the action itself they dont do much success however its defined takes action and taking good and appropriate action takes skills some of these skills not enough though are taught in school not well enough either others are taught on the job and still others we learn from general life experience below is a list of general skills that will help anyone get ahead in practically any field from running a company to running a gardening club of course there are skills specific to each field as well but my concern here is with the skills that translate across disciplines the ones that can be learned by anyone in any position

1220248 all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching in righteousness correcting training in righteousness so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work
1220249 and why do you break the command of god for the sake of your tradition

1220281 yet surely it would be thought better or rather necessary above all for philosophers to refute in defense of the truth even views to which one is attached since although both are dear it is right to give preference to the truth
1220282 those who think that there is only one on the ground that it admits of degrees have based their belief on insufficient evidence because things that differ in species also admit of difference in degree
1220283 it seems that each individual loves what is good for himself i e that while the good is absolutely lovable it is the good of the individual that is lovable for the individual
1220284 of a particular patient because what he treats is the individual
1220285 ought to wish our friend good for his own sake
1220286 for each others good in respect of the quality for which they love each other
1220287 these friendships being accidental because the person loved is not loved on the ground of his actual nature but merely as providing some benefit or pleasure
1220288 give rise to complaints because since each associates with each other for his own benefit they are always wanting the better of the bargain and thinking that they have less than they should and grumbling because they do not get as much as they want although they deserve it
1220289 that is why they fall in and out of friendship quickly changing their attitude often within the same day
1220290 of those who are good and similar in their goodness
1220291 also each party is good both absolutely and for his friend since the good are both good absolutely and useful to each other similarly they please one another too for the good are pleasing both absolutely and to each other
1220292 everyone is pleased with his own conduct and conduct that resembles it
1220293 those who are in need are anxious for help and even the supremely happy are eager for company for they above all are the least suited by a solitary existence
1220294 for when a good man becomes a friend to another he becomes that others good so each loves his own good and repays what he receives by wishing the good of the other and giving him pleasure
1220295 so if we were right in saying that a friend wishes his friends good for his friends sake the latter must remain as he is whatever that may be so his friend will wish for him the greatest goods possible for a human being and presumably not all of these because it is for himself that everyone most of all wishes what is good
1220296 for any man who lives it will do so not as a human being but in virtue of something divine within him
1220297 presumably it is enough if as in the case of the gods or ones parents the beneficiary makes such a return as lies in his power
1220298 is not inconsistent with human nature because most people have short memories and are anxious to be well treated than to treat others well
1220299 it is perhaps no easy matter to lay down exact lines in such cases because they involve a great many differences of every kind
1220300 when the basis of their friendship is not what friends suppose to be
1220301 even more than if it had been a case of uttering false coin since the offense concerns something more valuable than money
1220302 those who are capable of recovery are entitled to our help for their characters even more than for their fortunes inasmuch as the character is a higher thing and more closely bound up with friendship
1220303 it would seem from what we have said is possible
1220304 the author of a kindness feels affection and love for the recipient even if he neither is nor is likely to be of any use to him
1220305 the reason for this is that existence is to everyone the object of choice and love and we exist through activity because we exist by living and acting and the maker of the work exists in a sense through his activity the maker loves his work because he loves existence this is a natural principle for the work reveals in actuality what is only potentially
1220306 for sake of his friend and neglects his own interest
1220307 but a mans best friend is the one who not only wishes him well but wishes it for his own sake even though nobody will ever know it and this condition is best fulfilled by his attitude towards himself
1220308 naturally it is hard to say which of these opinions one should follow since
1220309 because most people have a craving for these and set their hearts on them as the greatest goods which makes them objects of fiercest competition
1220310 certainly nobody would reproach him for being a self lover
1220311 might be considered to have a better title to the name
1220312 far superior as life ruled by reason is to life ruled by feeling and as desire for what is fine is to desire for an apparent advantage
1220313 and if everyone were striving for what is fine and trying his hardest to do the finest deeds then both the public welfare would be truly served and each individual would enjoy the greatest goods since virtue is of this kind
1220314 performs many actions for the sake of his friends and his country and if necessary even dies for them for he will sacrifice both money and honours and in general the goods that people struggle to obtain in his pursuit of what is morally fine
1220315 this result is presumably achieved by those who give their lives for others so their choice is a glorious prize
1220316 who does not take petty risks nor does he court danger because there are few things that he values highly but he takes great risks and when he faces danger he is unsparing of his life because to him there are circumstances in which it is not worth living
1220317 the more he will be distressed at the thought of death for to such a man life is supremely worth living and he is loosing one of his greatest blessings and he knows it and this is a grievous thing
1220318 what then is the meaning of those who uphold the first view and what truth is there in their argument
1220319 if we are better able to observe our neighbors than ourselves and their actions than our own
1220320 life is in itself good and pleasant as appears from the fact that it is sought after by all especially by those who are virtuous and truly happy because their life is in the highest degree desirable and their existence the truest felicity
1220321 hence it appears that to live is primarily to perceive or to think
1220322 to be conscious that we are perceiving or thinking is to be conscious of our existence
1220323 capacity relative to its activity and its realization is dependent upon the activity
1220324 the weak side of this tehnique is that we are never so defenceless agaisnt suffering as when we love never so helpelessly unhappy as when we have lost our loved object or its love
1220325 grotesque bodies pieced together of sundry members without definite shape having neither order coherence or proportion except by accident
1220326 preparing the way for that friendship which we cherished so long as it was gods will with such entirety and such perfection it needs so many concurring factors to build it up that it is much if fortune attains to it
1220327 which i shall ever hold for so ye gods have willed sacred to grief and honour without end
1220328 in the friendship i speak of they mingle and unite one with the other in a blend so perfect that the seam which has joined them together is effaced and can never be found again
1220329 it is i know not what quintessence of all this mixture which having seized my whole soul brought it to plunge and loose itself in his
1220330 this answer carries no better sound than mine would do to one that should question to me in this fashion
1220331 should trust myself more willingly with him than with myself
1220332 presumably there is no one correct number of friends but anything between certain limits
1220333 it is indivisible each one gives himself so entirely to his frriend that he has nothing left to distribute to others on the contrary he is sorry that he is not double triple or quadruple and that he has not several souls and several wills to confer them all upon this one object
1220334 so i also could wish to speak to such as have had experience of what i say but knowing how remote a thing such a friendship is from common practice and how rarely it is found i do not look to meet with any competent judge for
1220335 170 the attack on writings such as that of aristotle seems to be
1220336 why should i linger on with deadened sense and ever aching heart a worthless fragment of a fallen shrine no no one day hath seen thy death and mine
1220337 a man of resolute nature takes no care to involve his friends in his troubles and in general does not give them a chance to lament with him because he himself does not indulge in lamentation either
1220338 for in truth if i compare the rest of my life though with the grace of god it has passed sweetly and easily and except for the loss of such a friend free form any griveous affliction and in great tranquility of mind seeing i was content with my natural and original advantages without seeking others if i should compare it all i say with the four years that were granted to me to enjoy the sweet company and society of that man it is nothing but smoke nothing but a dark and irksome night

1220367 if there is no standard higher than the ideal of our society we are utterly unable to take a critical distance from that ideal but the mere fact that we can raise the question of worth of the ideal of our society shows that there is something in man that is not altogether in slavery to his society and therefore that we are able and hence obliged to look for a standard with reference to which we can judge the ideals of our society as well as any society
1220368 it becomes possible for us to see a crisis of affirmation as something we have to meet through a transfiguration of our vision rather than simply through a recognition of some objective standard of goodness the recovery may have to take the form of a transfiguration of our stance towards the word and the self rather than simply the registering of external reality
1220369 our aversion to fanatical obscurantism must not lead us to embrace natural right
1220370 obtains between those who share a life for the satisfaction of
1220371 if anyone wants to make a serious study of the fine and just things or of political science generally he must have been well trained in his habits
1220372 so the just according to nature is better than the just according to convention but what we are inquirng about is the politically just and the politically just is that which is by convention not that which is by nature
1220373 that which has everywhere the same power and does not depend on being opined or not
1220374 that with regard to which in the beginning it makes no difference whether matters are this or that way but once it is established one way or another it does make a difference
1220375 ought to be given some reward honour or dignity it is those who are not satisfied with these rewards that develop into despots
1220376 in all these cases persons cultural background made a difference to his or her treatment by the courts the law was pluralized and departures from the norm of formal equality were made in different ways and guises showing how to reconcile the apparently conflicting demands of uniformity and diversity
1220377 but in the opinion of some all things are such on the ground that what is by nature is unchangeable and has everywhere the same power just as fire here and in persia burns but they see that the just things change
1220378 while there is something by nature it is all changeable and yet nevertheless there is that which is by nature and that which is not by nature
1220379 now which is by nature of the things that can be otherwise and which is not but is instead conventional and by agreement since both of them are equally changeable is clear
1220380 by nature the right is stronger though it is possible for everyone to become ambidextrous
1220381 yet nevertheless the left is such and such by nature and the right is no less better than the left even if we were to do everything with the left as with the right
1220382 this is why money is so called because it exists not by nature but by custom and it is in our power to change its value or render it useless
1220383 the just things that are not by nature but merely by humans are not the same everywhere since the regimes are not
1220384 the laws prescribe for all departments of life aiming at the common advantage
1220385 the law commands some kinds of behaviour and forbids others rightly of the law is rightly enacted but not so well if it is an improvised measure
1220386 similarly the just things that are not by nature but merely by humans are not the same everywhere since the regimes are not though there is only one that is everywhere according to nature the best
1220387 as for the education of the individual that which makes him simply a good man we must determine later whether it falls under political science or some other because probably it is not always the same thing to be a good man and a good citizen
1220388 so let us first try to review any valid statements that have been made by our predecessors and then to consider in the light of our collected examples of constitutions what influences are conservative and what are destructive of a state and for what reasons states are well governed for after examining these questions we shall perhaps see more comprehensively what kind of constit ution is the best
1220389 likewise in practical matters there are some principles naturally known as it
1220390 but not every action or feeling admits of a mean because some have names that directly connote depravity such as malice shamelessness and envy and among actions adultery theft and murder in either case one is always wrong
1220391 questions of conduct and expediency have as little fixity about them as questions about what is healthful and if this is true of the general rule it is still more true that its application to particular problems admits of no precision
1220392 those actions belonging to the very nature of justice cannot be changed in anyway for example theft must not be commited because an injustice
1220393 so also the things that are just be nature for example that a deposit ought to be returned must be observed in the majority of cases but is changed in the minority
1220394 the ultimate consequence of the thomistic point of view is practically inseparable from natural theology but even from revealed theology
1220395 like the acts of natural things not having purpose are everywhere the same such as fire which burns here just as it does in persia
1220396 not admitted by all and all nations do not concede them to be respectable
1220397 the effectiveness of general rules depends on their being taught without ifs or
1220398 there are also precepts prohibitions or permissions in accordance with divine law which agree in this respect with human law which since they are known in many instances i have not given examples of for the sake of abbreviating this sermon
1220399 for one can hardly deny that in all concrete decisions general principles are implied and presupposed
1220400 in extreme situations the normally valid rules of natural right are justly changed or changed in accordance with natural right the exceptions are as just as the rules
1220401 there is a universally valid hierarchy of ends but there are no universally valid rules of action
1220402 the only universally valid standard is the hierarchy of ends this standard is sufficient for passing judgment of the nobility of individuals and of actions and institutions but it is insufficient for guiding our actions
1220403 questions of conduct and expedience have as little fixity about them as questions about what is healthful and if this is true of the general urle it is still more true that its application to particular problems admits of no precision
1220404 if there is no standard higher than the ideal of our society we are utterly unable to take a critical distance from that ideal but the mere fact that we can raise the question of worth of the ideal of our society shows that there is something in man that is not altogether in slavery to his society and therefore that we are able and hence obliged to look for a standard with reference to which we can judge the ideals of our society as well as any society

1220633 at one time the orlando sentinel and the palm beach post had something like six or seven health reporters said post health industry reporter phil galewitz a board member for both florida health news and the association of health care journalists
1220634 its been a gradual erosion of coverage over the last few years
1220635 i dont see what else anyone could do to cut it more
1220636 thats a huge can of worms because jackson is taxpayer funded said shepherd
1220637 our watchdog role is diminished because we dont have a single person dedicated to jackson plain and simple
1220638 i wrote a lot of in depth 35 and 40 inch stories over that battle and i never detected a concern over space said wessel who left the paper in late july
1220639 now we have a story brewing about both of the big hospitals going after a heart transplant program im sure itll be covered but i dont see the reporter getting that kind of space to write about it
1220640 were seeing a lot of good wire stories that may have gone 800 1 000 words and theyre just being gutted down to 300 or 250
1220641 less enterprise more wires but not even the best of the wires
1220642 i call it a kid in a candy store view of u
1220643 stories dont probe for conflicts of interest or question the harm of policies youre also seeing a lot more of these unquestioning fluffy soft personal health personal gratification stories and less dedication to in depth analytical issue oriented stories
1220644 w hen our interns go into the newsrooms every summer there are almost no editors with time now to spend looking at their work duckham told the association of health care journalists at its annual convention in march
1220645 i think it means that theres very little historic memory in most newsrooms that they go into duckham said
1220646 i mean the great news is there are lots of people interested in the health beat but where are the paid jobs
1220647 we spend money to come here with our families it s an inexpensive place to stay if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1220648 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1220649 edouard is not going to have that large of an affect on tourism because it s not expected to cause severe damage
1220650 he ll just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices

1220652 las legislaciones que reconocen los matrimonios gays son contrarios a la raz n por conferir los derechos y obligaciones del matrimonio a personas gays
1220653 el matrimonio en realidad existe nicamente entre dos personas de sexo opuesto para colaborar con dios en la generaci n y educaci n de nuevas vidas
1220654 dado que las parejas matrimoniales cumplen el papel de garantizar el orden de la procreaci n y son por lo tanto de eminente inter s p blico el derecho civil les confiere un reconocimiento institucional las uniones homosexuales por el contrario no exigen una espec fica atenci n por parte del ordenamiento jur dico porque no cumplen dicho papel para el bien com n
1220655 existe nicamente entre dos personas de sexo opuesto que por medio de la rec proca donaci n personal propia y exclusiva de ellos tienden a la comuni n de sus personas
1220656 for example can you show 3 nephi 2 15 from the 1840 edition in the 1830 edition and all editions i have looked at prior to 1981 it says
1220657 and their curse was taken from them and their skin became white like unto the nephites 3 nephi 2 15
1220658 all editions prior to 1981 except for this one instance in the 1840 edition
1220659 if you ever put your hands on my cock again
1220660 innovation has always been a hallmark of skype and i want to innovate not only with the products we bring to market but also with how we bring them to market
1220661 scott has an outstanding track record and will be able to help us apply best practices in staying ever more customer focused and nimble even while becoming larger
1220662 i believe in skype not only because ive been a user since the early days but also because im convinced the opportunities ahead for skype are tremendous given how the world is changing
1220663 skype combines superior multimedia communications technology with making the world a better place by cost effectively connecting consumers on a global scale as well as enabling smaller businesses to grow without the unnecessary fuel consumption costs and carbon pollution generated by needless travel it is truly a privilege to join the skype team and help to build a great company
1220664 this is a great way to show people how easy it is to use skype wherever they happen to be
1220665 our nomad has to keep moving for a long time the only downtime she will have is when shes on a flight or some form of transport that keeps her moving
1220666 im really excited about the trip but im sure it will be hard to keep moving
1220667 the great thing is i have a whole online community to rely on who can guide me to make the right decisions on what i eat and how i keep moving in any of the 15 countries ill be in i am sure ill need a holiday afterwards travelling can be a bit lonely but with skype i know i can stay in touch with my friends and family for free or very little and thats very reassuring
1220668 these are still the early days for making skype calls on mobile phones but weve already made great strides in this space
1220669 among other things we have a great relationship with 3 the mobile operator which has brought the mobile skype experience to eight markets through the 3 skypephone and a range of other packages and phones skype for your mobile will expand the available options even further
1220670 it is an important time for us to listen to our users feedback be it through surveys or user forums we need to hear what delights them and where there is still work to be done but this product underscores our commitment to innovation and to putting skype conversations in the pockets of todays mobile masses
1220671 he has a perfect record every cardiac arrest hes ever worked has survived
1220672 im having a really hard time getting oxygen into her
1220673 shes ninety years old her ribs probably snapped like toothpicks one of them must have punctured her lung
1220674 mama lets stack some for puck and think of her
1220675 skype is a great tool for businesses especially smaller businesses who thrive on productivity while at the same time keeping an eye on the bottom line being able to see your customer on video for free when you are talking to them is a massive benefit and made even better because skype is so simple to use
1220676 and making business relationships work when youre running a fast growth company can be tough as a majority of all communication is non verbal being able to see the people youre working with using skype video calling is a real asset it allows you to be flexible and doesnt discriminate in terms of where your customers are based more importantly because you can see your customers this reduces the need for face to face meetings so you have more time to work on new areas of you business whilst looking after your customer base
1220677 the industry is already in full swing trying desperately to stop these new rules they are using the usual tactics their most vocal threat is that this could choke off credit lol not even a new born baby would believe that one if they dont lend especially now with the new rules they dont make money so that argument is just a scare tactic
1220678 can you increase my apr or change my terms any time for any reason
1220679 hey i feel like being a fan of so and so team now
1220680 this move is a natural step for skype skype was founded on the principle of making free voice and video calls available to people all around the world and now were making it even easier for the skype community to call their friends and family who are not yet on skype our subscriptions give people an easy hassle free choice for how and when they want to catch up with their loved ones
1220681 for example if you live in london for just 2 95 a month you can call your grandmother in poland whenever you like talk for up to six hours at a time and not worry about how much its costing you your grandmother doesnt need to understand the internet you just use your skype subscription to make the call and she just picks up the phone and if you have friends and family spread over the world you can reach them all for as little as 8 95 a month when you combine the free features skype is known for from instant messaging to conference calling to video calls with our subscriptions its hard to find a better alternative
1220682 if im wrong im sorry im not really sure but im pretty sure
1220683 look babe its your model type s dropped and everything
1220684 no its not babe i know i looked at it its your model bc it has your lip and body and all that
1220685 there has to be something after postmodern like post postmodern or super postmodern
1220686 end coercive interrogations and secret detentions by the central intelligence agency
1220687 these practices have brought shame to our nation have harmed our ability to fight the war on terror and i believe violate u s law and international treaty obligations
1220688 our nation has paid an enormous price because of these interrogations they cast shadow and doubt over our ideals and our system of justice our enemies have used our practices to recruit more extremists our key global partnerships crucial to winning the war on terror have been strained
1220689 look at two of our closest allies in the world the british parliament no longer trusts u s assurances that we will not torture detainees the canadian government recently added the united states to its list of nations that conduct torture
1220690 this is not the country that we want to be
1220691 many of the more than 246 million skype users around the world are increasingly mobile and want to stay connected on the go
1220692 making the richer skype experience available on mobile devices partly hinges on the need for more processing power which in turn tends to shorten battery life intels focus on lowering power consumption helps us minimize that conundrum underscoring our evolution beyond the desktop and its good news to anyone who has found themselves missing skype on the road
1220693 the emergence of mobile internet devices represents an exciting new user experience
1220694 intels low power technologies combined with skypes optimized software will enable mid users to easily stay in touch with their family and friends wherever they go
1220695 myspaceim with skype is a truly groundbreaking product integration and partnership

1220705 we couldnt be more pleased to have josh and andre taking on such critical leadership roles their deep expertise in building and leading fast growth companies combined with their history at ebay makes them the ideal leaders for the skype and shopping businesses
1220706 internet access is rapidly spreading beyond just the home or office computer and a world increasingly blanketed with wireless connections is giving skype conversations the freedom to travel almost anywhere
1220707 with the introduction of new mass market devices at ces that support skype millions of people around the world will now be able to leave the desk behind put skype in their pocket and take their conversations with them i think that is immensely liberating
1220708 szukamy towarzyszy a nie krzykaczy szukamy dzielnych i wiernych przyjaci
1220709 this is a major leap in the clarity and smoothness of free video calls over the internet
1220710 high quality video is a tremendous opportunity to delight our more than 246 million users and take their skype experience to a whole new level one in four skype calls already involve video so we know our users love to show and not just tell high quality video will take skype conversations to a whole new level of realism in the past only big businesses could afford this kind of video quality its now time to take it to everyone else
1220711 high quality video takes all the promises of video calling staying connected with family and friends traveling the world without a suitcase and increasing collaboration among colleagues spread across a global network and dramatically enhances the quality of the experience
1220712 once people start enjoying high quality video at vga resolution and 30 frames per second a level of quality that is sharper and smoother than weve ever seen on skype before were confident that it will quickly become an indispensable way to stay connected
1220713 our recent announcement made many people realize that sharp smooth and life like video calls on the internet should be available to everyone not just big companies with expensive video conferencing equipment
1220714 those whove previewed high quality video have been blown away by its realism today with skype 3 6 for windows the genie is out of the bottle for good
1220715 skype is now truly mobile this new handset is incredibly easy to use and lets you make free mobile skype calls when you are on the move to other skype users all over the world no matter where they are it couldnt be simpler put skype in your pocket and make free skype mobile calls and send free skype instant messages at the touch of a single skype button
1220716 skype began by offering free pc to pc calling and now were doing the same with mobile calls with 3 thanks to 3 skype has now taken a giant step forward in the mobile arena it takes an innovative operator like 3 to challenge traditional thinking and offer the kind of product other operators are still shying away from
1220717 3 wants to make the mobile internet available to everyone to do this we believe that services need to be simple to access and affordable communication is the prime function of the mobile today skype is the leader in internet communications to enable skype to go mobile in this way brings free internet calls together with an affordable 3g handset mobile has the potential to massively increase access to internet calling
1220718 more than his throws what i was pleased with is how he was looking to the right guy when he was backpedaling
1220719 he knew the plays knew the routes he should feel very good about his performance
1220720 its always crowded this bay and beach 116th where the teenage girl drowned this summer are the busiest bays in rockaway the public parking lot is across the street the lifeguard shack public bathrooms concession stand are here but on most days in the scariest summer in years i have just two lifeguards this is beyond bureaucratic incompetence this is dangerous bordering on criminal
1220721 because i dared to tell the truth about how dangerous the lifeguard situation is in rockaway in the pages of the daily news
1220722 this is how my bosses get even the six bays janet fash oversees from beach 96th to beach 102nd sts get two lifeguards per chair my bosses will tell you they staff the beaches by state guidelines of one lifeguard for every 50 yards thats cya time because an addendum to the state guideline says that when theres a higher bather load bigger crowd we will provide more lifeguards but they dont period so what are they waiting for a lawsuit for me to have a drowning
1220723 they are playing with public safety in a summer when the waters of rockaway are more dangerous than theyve been for years
1220724 weve already had one drowning and august is always the worst month for drownings because of the storms
1220725 im not saying the drowning of that girl this summer could have been prevented
1220726 the ocean is the ocean for the last few years its been like a lake here but this summer the rip currents have been wicked on my bays alone my lifeguards have probably done 150 preventive measures and 50 rescues my beaches have been dredged rearranging the sandbars creating underwater tunnels which cause the rip currents on these bays we get mostly dfds people down for the day most are not great swimmers many cant swim at all these are the people who need lifeguards most
1220727 these people were basically baptized in these waters they grow up knowing how to ride a rip current yet down here where the beaches are a quarter as populated as mine they have four and five lifeguards per bay
1220728 a young mother brings her child to the shore and she swims closest to the lifeguard chair but thats the place where its most dangerous they also dont use a red and green flag system like in long beach that prohibits swimming by the jetties with a red flag and permits swimming only inside the green flags in the center of the bay when i look at this i want to cry because its an invitation to disaster
1220729 if you live in the housing projects of far rock you have to walk 20 blocks to find an open beach with a lifeguard
1220730 the city will say its to preserve the piping plovers but that doesnt prevent the city from keeping open the beaches for the endangered birds in neponsit or belle harbor
1220731 i can handle it but the public should be aware that if they come to my crowded bays from beach 96th to beach 102nd they will only be served by two lifeguards
1220732 we werent preoccupied with the idea that wed find deception
1220733 but we found that the mere presence of a rival has a very strong effect

1220735 know best their own specific problems strengths resources and needs they know best the people that live in the neighbourhood neighbourhoods are made up of people who have the power to protect each others safety
1220736 the number of tip calculator apps for iphone is quickly becoming absurd
1220737 its moving in the right direction its just going to take them a long time
1220738 we anticipate that their health will improve because there is a great difference between the states in which they were in yesterday and how they are today thanks to allah
1220739 its unacceptable for the government to fold its arms when people are living in such appalling conditions without running water and other basic facilities
1220740 those refugees killed when they went back into the communities were not killed by community members but by criminals
1220741 if people refuse to be reintegrated we cant evict them and close the camps but we believe reintegration will work
1220742 i went back because these mediators came from premier ebrahim rasools office and told us that the communities are now safe because theyve spoken to the people but i will be killed here if i dont pay these people
1220743 they ordered some quarts and ate and drank i had to pay the bill and then they said im welcome
1220744 they said i must be kind and nice to them and then i can stay otherwise you must fuck off kwerekwere foreigner they said i pay about r250 every weekend for my safety
1220745 some nigerians who are criminals didnt have to flee when the xenophobic attacks started foreigners already doing business with criminals werent touched
1220746 these women were killed trying to do their work and improve life in by cleaning the streets nothing can justify the deaths of innocent victims especially wives and mothers such as these who were working hard to make ends meet
1220747 i extend my condolences to their families and to all somalis i also call on true somali patriots to use restraint and address their problems through contact and dialogue as preached by their religion and their culture
1220748 after so many years of violence somalis should use this sad time to regain their sense of dignity through working together for lasting peace
1220749 we are really proud that we are not at least off the world sports map and we put our faith confidence and hope on these young man and woman
1220750 i believe sports can bring our people together as people from around the world are coming together in harmony in china
1220751 the main aim of attending any event is not to win medals but the fact that people are brought together in peace and harmony is more important for us at this stage
1220752 no youre not the knights templar we have the records to prove that we set them on fire and gave their stuff to the other military orders
1220753 i wonder what a holy grail goes for with 700 years of compound interest
1220754 no our chaplains are ordained and lay members of churches to which they personally belong and give advice and spiritual guidance accordingly
1220755 i am a false prophet and god is a superstition
1220756 when questioned about the templars anticipated use for the money their spokesman made vague references to the brazillian rainforest
1220757 if mothers ruled the world there would be no goddamned wars in the first place
1220758 i think the main thing is the same way we wanted to do something radically different with this we wouldnt want to repeat ourselves and just do another volume in the same format and the same kind of approach theres a lot of discussion going on with tori and i on possibilities and well see how things go
1220759 just let the stupid people who believe in that join it
1220760 im drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and greys
1220761 john mcmasters told me that on the flagship apollo in the late sixties he witnessed hubbards drug supply
1220762 last thursday fox news ran a brief segment on a kfc restaurant opening in fallujah before segueing into an interview with former centcom commander tommy franks who was asked to comment on the presence of an american fast food restaurant in the notoriously violent iraqi city
1220763 they get in and get out and so far they do it safely
1220764 concerning the military we have a long standing and excellent relationship with them as we have quite a few kfc taco bell and pizza hut stores in military bases outside the us
1220765 youve come up with a theory that while totally ridiculous actually makes more sense than every religion in the world
1220766 at present it is not possible for most readers to confirm the truthfulness of the statements anonymous is reportedly making to martinez and martinez is passing on to the public
1220767 i just needed a chance to redacted and cindy was a big help
1220768 michelle and i have been redacted for years sometimes we even include our daughters in our redacted

1220774 crude futures are down despite a brewing storm and that shows you how momentum has shifted in this market
1220775 despite all these bullish inferences a lower market must mean that participants have an infinitely greater concern about a deteriorating global economy
1220776 the sentiment is more bearish now than before as concern over slower us economic growth is impeaching demand
1220777 we do expect oil prices to trend lower in the longer term
1220778 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomisation of the query id and the source port essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response
1220779 however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my os x 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomise the source port
1220780 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1220781 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
1220782 in these cases the network device performing pat port address translation uses a predictable source port allocation policy such as incremental allocation when performing the layer 4 rewrite operation that is necessary for pat
1220783 how many drownings does it take before the public realizes that the water safety decisions at those beaches are made in some office in manhattan by people who know nothing about ocean lifeguarding
1220784 theyre made in union offices by peter stein and the people he makes supervisors through patronage
1220785 shes entitled to her views but i just wish she had some evidence
1220786 there are rigorous rules in place for our beaches and pools for how many lifeguards we need and how they must be deployed
1220787 if there are disagreements of a professional or personal nature between janet fash and peter stein thats not our bailiwick
1220788 you cant prevent people from being active in the union but theres no patronage
1220789 the message to them is that your chief is speaking out and this is what youre getting because of it
1220790 no one not the lifeguards the public or even the city has been able to break peter steins stranglehold on the lifeguard system
1220791 max load shelf 29 lb 55 the bookcase could be placed on its side too
1220792 it would be a spectacular addition to philadelphias skyline sustainability efforts and building green continue to be hallmarks of this administration and the plans for this particular project are consistent with those goals
1220793 through a series of community forums various stakeholder groups will have an opportunity to voice the concerns that they may have we dont have a full picture of what that feedback will be but concerns will be heard and appropriately handled
1220794 when william penn planned the city it was written that no building was to exceed the height of his statue
1220795 these two were complete idiots if this was two fat fucks from south philly it would have been turner and hooch
1220796 whats so fantastic is that we found them completely furnished with beds chairs tables communication systems and the personal effects of the soldiers who lived inside
1220797 emptied by the danes of their contents after world war ii to salvage the scrap iron and electrical devices that were needed
1220798 it was like entering the heart of a pyramid with mummies all around i dug a tunnel through the sand that was blocking the entrance to the bunkers and what i saw blew me away it was as if the german soldiers had left only yesterday
1220799 it was a race against the clock because of the risk of looters we lied to keep them at bay saying that there was only one furnished bunker and that it was guarded around the clock which wasnt true but even so there were two attempted break ins
1220800 it was surprising to see the soldiers living conditions in the bunkers
1220801 in a way this discovery can be compared to tutankhamuns tomb almost a century ago it has to be preserved and to blow up the bunkers as some have suggested would be like denying that world war ii ever existed
1220802 disgusted that people want to attract tourists to this kind of garbage
1220803 was not from the bronze age what has been found is incredibly authentic and tells us a lot about how they lived in these bunkers
1220804 we dont expect contemporary objects like these to be so well preserved maybe its because they were kept for 60 years in the cold and dark like in a big vacuum
1220805 world war ii and its memories will not just go away and discoveries like these breathe new life into the story and the fascination that still surrounds this war

1220822 you can see the fish rippling the surface and you try to cover them
1220823 we fished the sweet water you know freshwater big lakes and ponds
1220824 my father brought it from guyana i learned to throw it as a youngster
1220825 we like fresh fish and its fun to catch them
1220826 yeah theyre heavy and they weigh the bag down its tiring

1220842 after a while as i lay there i became aware of someone with me hunkered down in the corner and i just assumed it was my father whose presence i had felt over the years when i was frightened or alone
1220843 it turned out that this man worked for the dalai lama and he said gently that we believe when a lot of things start going wrong at once it is to protect something big and lovely that is trying to get itself born and that this something needs for you to be distracted so that it can be born as perfectly as possible
1220844 within the word we find two dimensions reflection and action in such radical interaction that if one is sacrificed even in part the other immedicately suffers
1220845 and since dialogue is the encounter in which the united reflection and action of the dialoguers are addressed to the world which is to be transformed and humanizes this dialogue cannot be reduced to the act of one persons depositing ideas in another nor can it become a simple exchange of ideas to be consumed by the discussants
1220846 it is an act of creation it must not serve as a crafty insturment for the domination of one person by another the domination implicit in dialogue is that of the world by the dialoguers it is conquest of the world for the liberation of humankind
1220847 on the other hand dialogue cannot exist without humility the naming of the world through which people constantly re create that world cannot be an act of arrogance dialogue as the encounter of those addressed to the common task of leaning and acting is broken if the parties or one of them lack humility men and women who lack humility or have lost it cannot come to the people cannot be their partners in naming the world someone who cannot acknowledge himself to be as a mortal as everyone else still as a long way to go before he can reach the point of encounter at the point of encounter there are neither utter ignoramuses nor perfect sages there are only people who are attempting together to learn more than they now know
1220848 founding itself upon love humility and faith dialogue becomes a horizontal relationship of which mutual trust between the dialogueers is a logical consequence
1220849 hope is rooted in mens incompletion from which they move out in constant search a search which can be carried out only in communion with others hopelessness is a form of silence of denying the world and fleeting from it
1220850 thinking which discerns an indivisible solidarity between the world and the people and admits of no dichotomy between them thinkinking which perceives reality as process as transformatin rather than a static entity thinking which does not separate itself from aciton but constantly immerses itself in temportlity without fear of the risks involved
1220851 only diealogue which requires critical thinking is also capable of generating critical thinking without diealogue there is no communicaiton and whout communication there can be no true education
1220852 for the dialogical problem posing teacher student the program content of education is neither a gift nor an imposition bits of information to be deposited in the students but rather the organized systemized and developed
1220853 it is not our role to speak to the people about our own view of the world nor to attempt to impose that view on them but rather to dialogue with the people about their view and ours we must realize that their view of the world manifested variously in their action reflects their situation in the world
1220854 in order to communicate effectibely educator and politician must understand the structural conditions in which the thought and language of the poeple are dialectically framed
1220855 consistently with the liberating purpose of dialogical education the objective of the investigation is not persons as if they were anatomical fragments but rather the thought language with which men and women refer to reality the levels at which they percieve that reality and their view of the world in which their generative themes are found
1220856 thus it is not the limit situations in and of themselves which create a climate of hopelessness but rather how they are percieved by women and men at a given historical moment whether they appear as fetters or as insurmountable barriers
1220857 only products which result from the activity of being but do not belong to its physical body though these products may bear its seal can give a dimention of meaning to the context which thus becomes a world a being capable of such production who thereby is necessarily aware of himself is a being for himself could no longer be if she or he were not in the process of being in the world with which he or she relates just as athe world would no longer exist if this being did not exist
1220858 in sum limit situations imply the existance of persons who are directly or indirectly served by these situations and of those who are negated and curbed by them
1220859 in order to achieve humanization which presupposes the elimination of dehumanizating oppression it is absolutely necessary to surmount the limit situations in which people are reduced to things
1220860 to truly know it they would have to reverse their starting point
1220861 the important thing from the point of view of liberatian education is for the popele to come to feel like masters of their thinking by discussing the thinking and views of the world explicitly or implicitly manifest in their own suggestions and those of their comprades because this view of education starts with the conviction that it cannot present its own program but must search for this program dialogically with the people it serves to introduce the pedagody of the oppressed in the elaboration of which the oppressed must participate
1220862 the arabs are being treated with suspicion since 9 11 while white men were not treated that way after tim mcveighs bombing of the federal building in oklahoma city is entirely completely about white privilege after all the 19 men who hijacked the four planes on the fateful day were no more representative of the 1 5 billion muslims on the planet than mcveigh and terry nichols were of the 100 million or so white men in this country and yet the case of the former we act as if profiling is a moral and practical imperative while we would have never stood for the same treatment in the latter case
1220863 better that is for reinforcing the privileged status of whiteness and white people who never have to answer for the behavior of the most deranged members of our community no matter what we do we are presumed safe presumed safe presumed warm and cuddly until proven otherwise unlike people of color

1220878 implicit in this simplistic definition of womens liberation is a dismissal of race and class as factors that in conjunction with sexism determine the extent to which an individual will be discriminated against exploited or oppressed
1220879 they recognized the possibility that feminism defined as social equal with men might easily become a movement that would primarily affect the social standing of white women in middle and upper class groups while affecting only in a very marginal way the social status of working class and poor women
1220880 they all came together based on a biological and sociological fact rather than on a body of ideas
1220881 the oppression in a civil society i e in the social sphere not regulated by the state is a fact of life and the basic civil relationship between a man and a woman will always remain a battlefield women being less aggressive is then either the less human of the two and doomed to subjugation of else she must get more power hungry herself and try to dominate man liberation for both is not feasible
1220882 it is the freedom to decide her own destiny freedom from x determined role freedom from societys oppressive restrictions freedom to express her thoughts fully and to convert them freely into action feminism demands the acceptance of womans right to individually conscience and judgement it postulates that womans essential worth stems from her common humanity and does not depend on the other relationships of her life
1220883 feminism is a struggle to end sexist oppression therefore it is necessarily a struggle to eradicate the ideology of domination that permeates western culture on various levels as well as a commitment to reorganizing society so that the self development of people can take precedence over imperialism economic expansion and material desires
1220884 by rejecting the notion of an alternative feminist lifestyle that can emerge only when women create a sub culture whether it is living space or even space like womens studies which on many campuses has become exclusive and by insisting that feminist struggle can begin wherever an individual woman is we create a movement that focuses on our collective experience a movement that is continually mass based
1220885 they teach us that the individual good is more imporatnt than the collective good and consequently that individual change is of greater significance than collective change this particular form of cultural imperialism has been reproduced in feminist movement in the form of individual women equating the fact that their lives have been changed in a meaningful way by feminism as is which a policy that no change need occur in the theory and prazis even if it has little or no impact on society as a whole or on masses of women
1220886 the belief that the self is formed in opposition to an other
1220887 i do not pretend that my approach is politically neutral yet this disturbs students who have been led to believe that all education within the university should be
1220888 if we accept education in this richer and more dynamic sense of acquiring a critical capacity and intervention in reality we immediately know that there is no such thing as neutral education all education has an intention a goal which can only be political
1220889 i do not pretend that my approach is politically neutral yet this disturbs students who have been led to believe that all education within the university should be
1220890 if we accept education in this richer and more dynamic sense of acquiring a critical capacity and intervention in reality we immediately know that there is no such thing as neutral education all education has an intention a goal which can only be political
1220891 in order to dominate the dominator has no choice but to deny true praxis to the people deny them the right to say their own word and thinking their own thoughts he and she cannot act dialogically for to do so would mean either that they had relinquished their power to dominate and joined the cause of the oppressed or has lost the power through miscalculations
1220892 the dialogue which is radically necessary to revolution corresponds to another radical need that of women and men as beings who cannot be truly human apart from communication for they are essentially communicative creatures to impede communication is to deduce men to the status of things and this is a job for oppressors not for revolutionaries
1220893 the revolution is made neither by the leaders for the poeple nor by the people for the leaders but by both acting together in unshakable solidarity this solidarity is born only when the leaders witness to it by their humble loving and courageous encounter with pepople not all men and women have sufficient courage for this encounter but when they avoid encounter they become inflexible and treat others as mere objects instead or nurturing life they kill life instead of searching for life they flee from it and these are oppressor characteristics
1220894 we can legitimately say that in the process of oppression someone oppresses someone else we cannot say that in the process of revolution someone liberates someone else nor yet that someone liberates himself but rather that human beings in communion liberate each other
1220895 to do this would fall into one of the myths of the oppressor ideology the absolutizing of ignorance this myth implies the existance of someone who decrees the ignorance of someone else the one who is doing the decreeing defines himself and the class to which he belongs as those who know or where born to know he thereby defines others as alien entities the words of his own class come to be the true words which he imposes or attempts to impose on the others the oppressed whose words have been stolen from them those who steal the words of others develop a deep doubt in the abilities of the others and consider tham incompetent each time they say their word withough hearing the word of those whom they have forbidden to speak they grown more accustomed to power and acquire a taste of guiding ordering and commanding they can no longer live without having someone to give orders to under these circumstances dialogue is impossible
1220896 thus the road to revolution involves openness to the people not impoviousness to them it involves communion with the people not mistrust and as lenin pointed out the more a revolution requires theory the more its leaders must be with the people in orde to stand against the power of oppression
1220897 it is accomplished by the oppressors depositing myths indespinsable to the preservation of the status quo for example the myth that the oppressive order is a free society the myth that all persons are free to work where they wish that if they dont like their boss they can leave him and look for another job the myth that this order respects human rights and is therefore worthy of esteem the myth that anyone who is industrious can become an entrepreneur worse yet the myth that the street vendor is as much an entrepreneur as the owner of the large factory the myth of the universal right of education when all of the brizilian children who enter primary schools only a tiny fraction ever reach the university they myth of the equality of all individuals when the question do you know who youre talking to is still current among us the myth of the heroism of the oppressor classes as defenders of western christianity civilization against materialist bararism the myth of the charity to foster selective good deeds subsequently elaborated into the myth of disinterested aid which on the international level was severely criticized by pope john xxiii the myth that the dominant elites recognize their duties promote the advancements of the people so that the people in a gesture of graditude should accept the words of their elites and be conformed to them the myth that rebellion is a sin against god the myth of provate property as fundamental to personal human development so long as oppressors are the only true human beings the myth of the industriousness of the oppressors and the laziness and dishonesty of the oppressed as well as the myth of the natural inferiority of the latter and the superiority of the former
1220898 as the oppressor minority subordinates and dominates the majority it must diviide it and keep it divided in order to remain in power the minority cannot permit itself the luxury of tolerating the unification of the people which would undoubtedly signify a serious threat of their own hegemony
1220899 she made her plight and the plight of white women like herself synonymous with a condition addicting all american women in so doing she deflected attention away from her classicism her racism her sexist attitudes towards the masses of american women in the context of her book friedan makes clear that the women she saw as victimized by sexism were college educated white women who were compelled by sexist conditioning to remain in the home
1220900 a central tenet of modern feminism through has be the assertion that all women are oppressed this assertion implies as that women share a common lot that factors like class race religion sexual preference etc do not create a diversity of experience that determines the extent to which sexism will be an oppressive force in the lives of individual women sexism as a system of domination is institutionalized but it has never determined in an absolute way the fate of all women in this society being oppressed means the absence of choices it is the primary point of contact between the oppressed and the oppressor many women in the primary point of contact between the oppressed and the oppressor many women in this society do have choices as inadequate as they are therefore exploitation and discrimination are words that more accurately describe the lot of women collectively in the united states many women do not join the organized resistance against sexism precisely because sexism has not meant an absolute lack of choices they may know they are discriminated against on the basis of sex but they do not equate this with oppression under capitalism patriarchy is structured so that sexism restricts womens behavior in some realms even as freedom from limitations is allowed in other spheres the absence of extreme restrictions leads many women to ignore the areas in which they are exploited or discriminated against it may even lead them to imagine that no women are oppressed
1220901 this was not the case with white borgeois feminists for they could appeal to a large audience of women like themselves who were eager to change their lot in life their isolation from women of other class and race groups provided no immediate comparative base by which to test their assumptions of common oppression
1220902 the difference between the sexes is not whether one does or does not have a penis it is whether or not one is integral part of a phallic masculine economy
1220903 if we dared to criticize the movement or to assume responsibility for reshaping feminist ideas and introducing new ideas our voices were turned out dismissed silenced we could be heard only if our statements echoed the sentiments of the dominant discourse
1220904 these unacknowledged aspects of the social status of many white women prevent them from transcending racism and limit the scope of their understanding of womens overall social status in the united states
1220905 white women and black men have it both ways they can act as oppressor or be oppressed black men may be victimized by racism but sexism allows them to act as exploiters and oppressors of women white women may be victimized by sexism but racism enables them to act as exploiters and oppressors of black people
1220906 take up the white mans burden send forth the best ye breed go bind your sons to exile to serve your captives need to wait in heavy harness on fluttered folk and wild your new caught sullen peoples half devil and half child
1220907 education thus becomes an act of depositing in which the students are the depositories and the teacher is the depositor
1220908 but in the last analysis it is the people themselves who are filed away through the lack of creativity transformation and knowledge in this at best misguided system for apart from inquiry apart from the prazis individuals cannot be truly human knowledge emerges only through invention and re invention through the restless impatient continuing hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world with the world and with each other
1220909 the more completely they accept the passive role imposed on them the more they tend simply to adapt to the world as it is and to the fragmented view of reality deposited in them
1220910 indeed the interests of the oppressors lie in the changing consciousness of the oppressed not the situation which oppresses them for the more the oppressed can be led to adapt to that situation the more easily they can be dominated
1220911 the solution is not to integrate them into the structure of the oppression but to transform that structure so that they can become beings for themselves
1220912 they may perceive though their relations with reality that reality is really a process undergoing constant transformation if men and women are searchers and their ontological vocation is humanization sooner or later they may perceive the contradiction in which banking education seeks to maintain them and then engage themselves in the struggle for their liberation
1220913 from the outset her efforts must coincide with those of the students to engage in critical thinking and the quest for mutual humanization his efforts must be imbued with a profound trust in people and their creative power to achieve this they must be partners of the student in their relations with them
1220914 and since people recieve the world as passive entities education should make them more passive still and adapt them to the world the educated individual is the adapted person because she he is better fit for the world translated into practice this concept well suited to the purposes of the oppressors whose tranquility rests on how well people fit the world the oppressors have created and how little they question it
1220915 yet only through communication can human life hold meaning the teachers thinking is authenticated only by the authenticity of the students thinking the teacher cannot think for her students nor can she impose her thoughts on them authentic thinking thinking that is concerned about reality does not take place in ivory tower isolation but only in communication if it is true that thought has meaning only when generated by action upon the world the subordination of students to teachers becomes impossible
1220916 authentic liberation the process of humanization is not another deposit to be made in men liberation is a prazis the action and reflection of men and women upon their world in order to transform it
1220917 they must abandon the educational goal of deposit making and replace it with the posing of the problems of human beings in their relations with the world problem posing education responding ot the essence of consciousness intentionality rejects comuniques and embodies communication
1220918 in problem posing education people develop their power to perceive critically the way they exist in the world with which and in which they find themselves they come to see the world not as a static reality but as a reality in process in transformation
1220919 problem posing education bases itself on creativity and stimulates true reflection and action upon reality thereby responding to the vocation of persons as beings who are authentic only when engaged in inquiry and creative transformation in sum banking theory and practice as immobilizing and fixating forces fail to acknowledge men and women as historical beings problem posing theory and practice take the peoples historicity as their starting point problem posing education affirms men and women as beings in the process of becoming as unfinished uncompleted beings in and with a likewise unfinished reality
1220920 in this in completion ans this awareness lie the very roots of education as an exclusively human manifestation the unfinished character of human beings and the transformational character of reality necessitate that education be an ongoing activity
1220921 to alienate human beings from their own decision making is to change them into objects
1220922 education thus becomes an act of depositing in which the students are the depositories and the teacher is the depositor
1220923 and since people recieve the world as passive entities education should make them more passive still and adapt them to the world the educated individual is the adapted person because she he is better fit for the world

1220927 i will not be silent i will not be quite anymore
1220928 given the preceding context another issue of indubitable importance arises the fact that certain members of the oppressor class join the oppressed in their struggle for liberation thus moving from one pole of the contradiction to the other theirs is a fundamental role and has been so throughout the history of this struggle it happens however that as they cease to be exploiters or indifferent spectators or simply the heirs of exploitation and move to the side of the exploited they almost always brings with them the marks of their origin their prejudices and their deformations which include a lack of confidence in the peoples ability to think to want and to know accordingly these adherents to the peoples causes constantly run the risk of falling into a type of generosity of the oppressors is nourished by an unjust order which must be maintained in order to justify that generosity our converts on the other hand truly define to transform the unjust order because of their background they believe that they must be the executors of the transformation they talk about the people but they do not trust them and trusting the people is the indispensable precondition for revolutionary change a real humanist can be identified more by his trust in the people which engages him in their struggle than by a thousand actions in their favor without that trust those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re examine themselves constantly this conversation is so radical as not to allow of ambiguous behavior to affirm this commitment but to consider oneself the proprietor of revolutionary wisdom which must then be given to or imposed on the people is to retain the old ways the man or woman who proclaims devotion to the cause of liberation yet is unable to enter into communion with the people whom he or she continues to regard as totally ignorant is grievously self deceived the convert who approaches the people but feels alarm at each step they take each doubt they express and each suggestion they offer and attempts to impose his status remains nostalgic towards his origins
1220929 this conversation is so radical as not to allow of ambiguous behavior

1220933 the bush administration has tried to replace the constitutional rule of law with the power of the executive branch to disregard both the laws established by the legislative branch and the judgments of the judicial branch
1220934 the president has asserted that he has virtually unrestrained authority and that congress and the courts have none congress must exercise and the president must respect its constitutional obligation to legislate and conduct oversight on issues like nsa wiretapping military commissions the detention and treatment of enemy combatants habeas corpus and the power to declare war
1220935 a majority of the american people and an overwhelming proportion of grassroots democrats want the president impeached
1220936 exposing the truth about americas actions in the world over the past years and holding those responsible for it accountable is the prerequisite to setting relations with the world on a new more constructive basis
1220937 if the united states is to re engage effectively with the rest of the world they have to resurrect accountability for their high officials
1220938 the us government under the bush administration has systematically and flagrantly violated national and international law
1220939 the administration is using a sweeping doctrine the state secrets privilege to dismiss cases that could challenge government misconduct under this privilege established by the supreme court in 1953 the executive branch can halt cases that might expose government secrets when the administration invokes state secrets even judges are not allowed to assess the information and decide if the claim is valid instead the justice department simply declares that continuing the case even in a closed setting would jeopardize national security after that a judge is simply supposed to throw the case out of court so instead of the court checking the executive and keeping it within its constitutional boundaries the president becomes the only informed judge of his conduct

1220989 but where are the two drops of oil that i entrusted to you
1220990 car ma sutra les 10 meilleures mani res de jouir de votre voiture
1220991 the young man parra had us eating out of his hands
1220992 any time you can help the team out especially with an rbi is kind of lucky but if it can happen a few times then you feel better about the whole game as a complete package
1220993 in this league in the national league it helps to help yourself to help your team to be able to hit
1220994 a lot of people tend to say that when im throwing well
1220995 i like to think that the games i do well i probably throw more fastballs for strikes more often
1220996 i dont think its that much more if it is at all
1220997 it felt different without him in washington but here you feel it a lot more
1220998 every day i walked in here he was already here its just weird hes gone
1220999 theres always a period of shock when one of your longtime guys gets traded hopefully we can start rolling now
1221000 the type of player i hope to be ive always hoped to be the third hitter one day
1221001 that shows hes staying on the ball better hes not pulling off
1221002 you have to wait on em when youre facing lefties because they always have that breaking ball equalizer
1221003 most of the innings i felt i had to battle quite a bit they put me to the test petty good
1221004 for some reason we play really well against these guys
1221005 and when cliff lee is on the mound you just follow his lead
1221006 fastball command he throws the fastball where he wants to
1221007 i see a guy pitching with a lot of confidence
1221008 growing up i never thought id hit one homer let alone 100
1221009 its just a sign that you played in the bigs for a long time
1221010 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were sorry youre not going to know
1221011 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1221012 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1221013 we lost tonight thats the worst thing that happened the other stuffs forgotten its not surprising when were all competing were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen everybody gets to see it oh well
1221014 when you lose a guy whos been here a while its always a shock maybe well start rolling now
1221015 he pitched great until the hit then kind of just lost it from that point on
1221016 i dont think he loses focus but definitely this has been a bit of a trend at times where hell be lights out and then all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall
1221017 when i was a kid growing up the oakland as would fight each other every single why they called them the fighting they won the world championship
1221018 its not a major deal its what happens it makes teams better
1221019 most of the innings i felt i had to battle quite a bit they put me to the test petty good
1221020 for some reason we play really well against these guys
1221021 and when cliff lee is on the mound you just follow his lead
1221022 fastball command he throws the fastball where he wants to
1221023 i see a guy pitching with a lot of confidence
1221024 growing up i never thought id hit one homer let alone 100
1221025 its just a sign that you played in the bigs for a long time
1221026 i think it nagged him throughout the year and as the year went on i think he got a little better but i dont think he ever really got over it
1221027 hes done a lot hes more flexible hes worked hard i think hes ready to go
1221028 id just like to see him get a little more consistent on some of the things from the beginning to the end of the year youre always nervous that something is going to happen during the game is your biggest concern wed have to jog out there to punt the ball you never want to see that
1221029 i came back and tried to get in rhythm right away and be the punter i know i can be unfortunately i didnt have the year i wanted
1221030 the good thing now is my back feels great i feel strong i feel ill be the punter i can be and once was i just have to punt well and prove to the players on our punt team well get it back to one of the top punt coverage teams like it was in 06
1221031 i was not pleased a year ago with how our punt team performed
1221032 i know its always a combination of things with dave being a little bit injured and we didnt cover as well i really have concentrated on that were going to really do a lot of that in practice here and in preseason
1221033 there is a chance there could be several new guys on the punt team from a year ago itll work itself out through the preseason we need to get better
1221034 the confidence he gained in otas and the minicamp has carried over here to the training camp
1221035 i think he has more confidence in the routes hes running and knowing what hes doing it shows up
1221036 it means a lot to me to give back to the kids
1221037 there is a chance there could be several new guys on the punt team from a year ago itll work itself out through the preseason we need to get better
1221038 he brings a lot to the table as a rusher because he has some quickness and physicality about him
1221039 he played with some bumps and bruises last year if we can keep him out there and healthy i think hell make a big impact on the defense and on the pass rush
1221040 hes taken some opportunities to try to make plays down the field that maybe last year he wouldnt make because he would just take what the defense gave him
1221041 but i think he has a better command of the offense hes trying to anticipate when he can make the play down the field so i think some of that has occurred
1221042 its up to the coaches to decide whether i do that all i can control is my effort and the way i play its a lot of competition but its healthy competition
1221043 its a great feeling i love it im telling the coaches to give me a wristband with the plays on it
1221044 ive got to get ahead and mix up my pitches more
1221045 i think i got a little predictable with what i was doing
1221046 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1221047 back in 04 the olympic teams performance in athens left a great deal to be desired
1221048 i had no idea at that moment that i would be asked if i would consider taking over the program but i did have a prerequisite full autonomy
1221049 i was aware of how things were structured in the past and i felt we needed to change the culture
1221050 with this program weve asked them to be committed to playing for their country and not just to play
1221051 these guys have done that over the last two years weve seen this program develop to where whether it be lebron james kobe bryant or jason kidd they feel like theyre part of a team part of a movement and theyre very proud to represent the united states
1221052 i think in some respects over the years weve been pretty arrogant saying its our game its not our game its the worlds game and the respect weve shown to international basketball over the last two years will pay dividends
1221053 when were with our teams we complain i wish i had chris paul in the backcourt or i wish i had dwight howard
1221054 i want this guy i want that guy because we all want to win
1221055 well everyone is in the room everyone is here theres no excuses now we have to get the job done
1221056 obviously the most talented team without a question in the world
1221057 ive learned a lot about these individuals getting to talk with them and look them in the eye
1221058 as far as garnett is concerned we never got any positive feedback
1221059 it was more about ive been there ive done that its time for someone else to do it
1221060 i think we have a unique opportunity right now in representing our country and not just by going for the gold medal in beijing
1221061 we can set a standard for how the game should be played right now in our own country with teamwork with camaraderie with enthusiasm with an attention to detail that makes basketball such a great team game
1221062 this team is showing all of that hopefully well show it at an even higher level and that will serve as an example for the kids growing up where basketball wont be all about a sound bite or a highlight dunk
1221063 its good for him to get back and immerse himself in the team
1221064 hes always raring to go our biggest challenge is to ease him back slowly and dont allow him to do more than he should
1221065 it takes a certain amount of time to get back in football shape
1221066 but he got a good start at it the doctors told us hell be better than he was last year physically as soon as he gets all his strength and flexibility back hell be fine
1221067 there is no reason to believe this is anything other than the simple burglary of a laptop
1221068 tsa suspends verified identity pass inc clear registered traveler enrollment
1221069 i dunno the one that makes that other thingie tighter
1221070 after many discussions and offers the coach felt that the university was working with him and was committed to the completion of the stadium since such a drafted document was never executed we never submitted it there is no agreement amending the buyout
1221071 theres a press release talking about the contract and sponsorship and it was in the star ledger article
1221072 used public money to pay schiano 250 000 and 625 000 from nelligan corporate sponsorship money
1221073 the new contract also increases schianos guaranteed income from private sources from 325 000 in 2005 to 625 000 in 2006 and 750 000 by 2012
1221074 i think they made a mistake by not disclosing all the elements of the contract or at least the compensation package
1221075 everybody would have been better served if no one had to go through that i dont know that there was anything illegal going on but it would have been better in a public relations standpoint
1221076 doctors said that if he survives half of his body would be paralyzed
1221077 we have initialed the text of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain last july 27 2008 the pact is a done deal it is binding on the contracting parties who are obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of their agreement
1221078 the act of initialing the moa ad agreed text between the parties constitutes a signature of the philippine government and milf initialing was in fact done with a credible third party witness the malaysian government as facilitator of the talks since 2001
1221079 nothing this is not even a setback to the milf we are on the upper hand especially in the battle for moral ascendancy
1221080 it is the arroyo administration which is shamed in the eyes of the international community there are so many ambassadors already in the malaysian capital to attend the signing ceremony only to be told that it is cancelled at the last minute
1221081 it is already a done deal the tuesday signing of the ancestral domain agreement is just for formality we are optimistic with the peace talks and we will pursue the peace process we want to achieve peace and appeal to everyone to support the talks

1221215 not all the characters drink or have sex and when they do its always put in a context behaviors are rooted in character theres decision making regret and consequences involved

1221227 pain is an and as such can be modified by emotions
1221228 reform judaism has never assigned a central religious role to the ancient temple therefore mourning the destruction of the temple in such an elaborate fashion did not seem meaningful more recently in reform judaism tishah bav has been transformed into a day to remember many jewish tragedies that have occurred throughout history
1221229 tishah bav could be a day that we spend in self reflection and self examination regarding 1 the legal economic social moral and religious issues of our own time 2 the ways our congregations and communities might measure ourselves and society against our commitments to social justice and 3 the obligations we have to take responsibility for helping to make this a better world
1221230 how far should we be willing to go in re adopting what so many of us believe to be antiquated and outmoded observances beliefs and rituals how far ought we be willing to stretch ourselves ideologically when it comes to these concepts which our reform fore bearers jettisoned
1221231 does mourning the loss of the immense and rich culture of european jewry that existed before the shoah mean that we desire to return to a ghettoized isolationist shtetl lifestyle obviously thats not what is meant when we mourn the loss of that culture we accept that a jewish way of life full of culture came to an end and we mourn its loss
1221232 there are days when all israel fasts because of the troubles that happened to them in order to awaken the hearts and open the pathways of repentance so that in the memory of these matters we will return to doing the good

1221246 mixed race children an exploratory study of racial categorisation and identity
1221247 mixed race children in britain have received very little sociological attention
1221248 early work on the american mulatto was inextricably linked with the concept of marginality equally involved in two conflicting cultures
1221249 nonetheless one is tempted to question whether students of race relations have been entirely justified in applying the dichotomous black white american model of race relations to the study of the identity of british children
1221250 asking a mixed race child if it is black or white entirely excludes the possibility that he or she has a clear and meaningful image of themselves as mixed or both
1221251 the sample consisted of 51 children each with one african afro caribbean or afro american parent and the other parent british or irish
1221252 i used photographs of children and adults rather than dolls in the test mine were colour photographs since skin shade was important in showing that some of the children were of mixed race
1221253 only two children in the group spontaneously grouped the photos into two groups white and non white described as black coloured or brown
1221254 some children took five graduations of colour as their main criteria yellow through beige tan and brown to black
1221255 some thought of the mixed group as being nearer to white others thought it nearer to black

1221270 the gold medal for naked self interest and breathtaking cynicism goes to john coates
1221271 perhaps some federal programs such as rescuing the murray darling or carbon emissions reduction schemes could be pruned or canned to find this money then we can watch those all important medals rolling in

1221319 wat is er met jou aan de hand heb je een gesst gezien of zo
1221320 ze heeft nog nooit van zweinstein gehoord of van perkamentus
1221321 hou je me voor het lapje perkamentus is de grootste tovenaar aller tijden daar moet je wel van gehoord hebben
1221322 ik heb er echt nog nooit van gehoord ik weet dat zweinstein een school is maar verder zou ik het niet weten wie is die perkamentus dan ik weet dat ik veel neit weet over jullie soort magie maar daar heb ik nog nooit van gehoord maarja jullie zullen nog wel nooit van larpskendaya gehoord of van areglion tournallat hensult of serpantha of wel
1221323 nou nee maar dat maakt ok niet uit het punt is perkamentus was de eenigste waarvoor voldemort bang was en vorig jaar is die gedood door een paar dooddoeners die gasten van jou zullen zoiets nooit kunnen of wel
1221324 maar van voldemort heb ik wel gehoord larpskendaya zou hem makkelijk aan kunnen
1221325 dus griddas bestaan wel er zijn geen bewijzen maar heb je ze gezien
1221326 zie je wel je hebt geen bewijzen die heb je nooit gehad en zul je ook nooit krijgen

1221332 nou je het niet echt tijd om de dingen te kopen want we moeten al naar het station ik breng je erheen maar daarna moet je het zelf doen prof anderling verteld de rest succes op school
1221333 dit lukt me dus nooit om da te gaan vinden

1221373 its easy in these kinds of legal competitions to kind of get lost in the technicalities and minutiae of the law jigar has a knack for breaking things down to the essentials and really seeing the heart of the matter and not getting too bound up in technical issues its a good thing as an advocate to be able to see the forest at the same time as the trees
1221374 i think he just saw doing the jag corps as a form of public service work
1221375 i think it takes a different kind of a person to go do your service where not only are there a lot of people who arent lawyers but there are a lot of people who didnt even go to college
1221376 i think he out hustled terri bonoff in terms of delegate contact clearly
1221377 he talked like he was a national candidate already if the dfl party were to go out and try to recruit somebody like this i dont even know where they would start
1221378 i felt that the young man was enterprising energetic hardworking
1221379 i liked the idea that he could make a credible argument about iraq because of course he had been there as a soldier
1221380 i think its an asset that he would have some republican or conservative leanings at some point in his life
1221381 hes not a knee jerk democrat hes not a democrat because dad and mom were democrats he actually had to think about the issues and arrive at some conclusions
1221382 they are still being very mindful of what got them there

1221384 compared to other areas of the country our market is still strong
1221385 we did not see a great jump in prices like so many others did so were not seeing great declines in prices
1221386 a lot of sellers have reduced the listing price of their homes and are about as low as they can go but a lot of buyers are still looking at the national media reports and sitting on the fence waiting to see if they could get a bargain
1221387 it fell through the floor in september and october of last year
1221388 we work with people from florida and new jersey and new york
1221389 there are a lot of homes on the market there their homes arent selling so theyre not able to move here
1221390 way down in 2007 we sullivan county were down 25 percent in sales from the year before thats not any better this year
1221391 with short sales and foreclosures accounting for approximately one third of transactions its hard to make an apples to apples comparison with a year ago when they were only a minor portion of the market
1221392 what were seeing is steady but with less volume in mortgage loans than six months or a year ago
1221393 were fortunate the tri cities is a pretty stable market
1221394 my concern is what well see in fuel prices and how that will affect overall retail sales
1221395 in many cases sellers are getting more realistic about the prices
1221396 i have a couple of cases in mind where the houses sold promptly after the prices came down the days of getting in a lucky shot higher price are gone
1221397 2005 was a banner year for housing starts and we had three record years in a row
1221398 in 2007 building permits dropped off 13 6 percent compared to 2006 the good news is the housing market reacts sharply to strong numbers so that means there wont be an oversupply of inventory

1221407 cats are more attached to their territory than to their owner
1221408 its important to keep them comfortable while they are contained for long periods of time
1221409 theres always a gray area about what caused what first
1221410 if its a category 4 storm theres usually no one around to see it
1221411 i think in this area they understand a little better than other areas
1221412 oh well he will give me the car insurance eventually
1221413 or he only cheats because he doesnt think he deserves me
1221414 he might not be with me for the right reasons but i am happy
1221415 but they will all negotiate just ask for it its like buying a car a lot of people think the price is set but its not
1221416 real estate commissions are determined between the sellers and their agents but the best advice i can give home sellers is that it is far more important to focus on an agents performance especially in todays housing market

1221439 racing is just a popular deal in our county and our area
1221440 i dont think hes told me anything other than gas it
1221441 youre not standing on it hard enough thats his claim
1221442 its one of those deals where you wish you could take your finger and stick it in their ear like a computer and just give them what you already know
1221443 you gotta take it as a compliment when they come ask what to do here and what to do there you keep an eye on them
1221444 if we dont make the race were there for the next guy were pretty small town we dont have big sponsors we just do what we love
1221445 in a small county like this a lot of people know each other

1221457 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1221458 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1221459 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1221460 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first

1221489 u s officials believe the elections initially scheduled for october are necessary for iraqs long term stability sunni arabs formerly the countrys elite boycotted the last such elections in january 2005 leading to the creation of provincial councils dominated by shiite muslims and kurds the absence of sunni muslims from local government helped strengthen the sunni led insurgency across central and northern iraq the stalemate emphasized the fissurges and entrenched positions among arabs turkmens and kurds in northern iraq which often threatens to spill over into violence

1221540 the united states loses four percent of the gross national product due to alloy corrosion
1221541 a network of continuous metal nanoparticles allow the carbon to dissolve and diffuse through the protective oxide scales without the need of a crack or a pore
1221542 by examining the oxide scale we find the metal nanoparticles
1221543 if they are eliminated we can create a more corrosion resistant and longer lasting alloy
1221544 our integration of arrays of nanowires that perform separate functions and are made of heterogeneous substances and doing this in a way that can be reproduced on a large scale in a controlled way is a first
1221545 our main objective is a route toward integrated nanowire arrays that we can produce on any substrate even paper and to reproduce them uniformly on a large scale
1221546 to do that over the past two years our group has developed methods of printing nanowire arrays after first growing the nanowires on a donor substrate we transfer them to any desired substrate including paper or plastic
1221547 nanowires grow sticking out in random directions they look like a bad hair day
1221548 is like combing the hair to make it stand up straight
1221549 to fabricate the integrated circuitry we had to position the two kinds of materials at precise locations on the receiver substrate
1221550 the pattern for the device was on a photoresist layer coated on the substrate first we printed the cadmium selenide nanowires onto the substrate then removed the photoresist with acetone leaving the cadmium selenide nanowires exactly where we wanted them we repeated the process for the germanium silicon nanowires
1221551 in the future we can foresee using a variety of different optical sensors to create nanoscale devices sensitive to multiple colors in high resolution
1221552 and thats just the beginning we contemplate printing nanowire sensor circuitry photosensors chemical sensors biosensors not on silicon but on paper or plastic tape this could be used easily and with instant results where spills have occurred or to test air quality or to test for disease organisms almost any use for a sensor that you can imagine

1221557 based on the press conference held on 24th july 2008 at the government media center colombo by senior dig nimal mediwake

1221560 optical techniques such as fluorescent probes can identify and localize features of interest in biological specimens with extremely high sensitivity and specificity but optical microscopy cannot resolve the features structure
1221561 the solution we are developing will allow researchers to use optical techniques to identify targets then transfer the sample and grid coordinates to a tem and automatically navigate to those targets to obtain high resolution images maintaining the sample in a frozen hydrated state throughout the entire process
1221562 tem can provide two dimensional images and three dimensional reconstructions of biological materials with nanometer scale resolution sufficient to resolve the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins and essential features of other macromolecules and molecular complexes
1221563 however without the localization provided by optical techniques finding those molecules is extremely difficult think of it as trying to find a particular string of glass beads in a barrel full of beads with correlative microscopy you can use techniques such as fluorescent markers to light up the string you are interested in and then go back to the same location for a closer look with the tem

1221570 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1221571 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1221572 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

1221574 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1221575 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1221576 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1221577 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

1221642 because land is very precious in china some places will not be allowed to build wind farms
1221643 typhoons wreaked havoc on poorly designed wind farms in the south of the country in recent years
1221644 the reality in china is they develop wind farms too fast
1221645 the local market is very limited because pv is too expensive
1221646 bearing the burden of the pollution that can go along with the manufacture of such renewable energy for other countries whether the acid rain forming sulfur dioxide emitted from making the steel in a wind turbines blade or the noxious chemicals left over after manufacturing specialized silicon or glass that can turn sunshine into electricity
1221647 to stop global warming its not an excuse to destroy the local environment

1221660 gerald posner argues that the warren commission properly investigated the assassination of jfk he claims to have refuted the critics purports to show what actually occurred and asserts simple factual answers to explain complex problems that have plagued the subject for years in the process he condemns all who do not agree with the official conclusions as theories driven by conjectures at the same time his book is so theory driven so rife with speculation and so frequently unable to conform his text with the factual content in his sources that it stands as one of the stellar instances of irresponsible publishing on the subject

1221665 in 1996 was ik bij de mannen de enige nederlandse judoka met een plak in 2000 hield ik als enige medaillewinnaar het judo in nederland op de kaart in 2004 leverden we met vier judomedailles de grootste olympische oogst ooit een substanti le bijdrage aan het medailleklassement dit keer zouden we zomaar meer dan vier medailles kunnen pakken
1221666 de zaal is een afgesloten hoofdstuk zeker het laatste jaar ben ik helemaal om het gaat nu zo goed dat we mee kunnen doen mee om de chte hoofdprijzen voor een sporter is dat het mooiste wat er is financieel is volleyballen in de zaal wellicht nog interessanter maar ik kies ervoor om op het allerhoogste niveau te blijven acteren en dat is op het strand samen met richard
1221667 in londen zal richard 39 zijn maar dat zegt niets ik weet genoeg wereldtoppers die n g ouder zijn
1221668 mijn enkels hebben op die harde vloeren al meer dan genoeg tikken gehad beachvolleybal is bovendien is mooier en dankbaarder om te spelen je hebt namelijk altijd een hoofdrol
1221669 als dat niet het geval zou zijn geweest had die gouden plak me niets gedaan nu wel maar een medaille hier zou voor mij persoonlijk veel meer waarde hebben
1221670 ik wil in topvorm op de mat verschijnen en ga er alles aan doen om op het podium te komen sportief gezien is het verschil tussen goud zilver en brons maar heel klein het is net als een atletiekrace over 100 meter waarop iemand met een verschil van slechts eenhonderdste wint
1221671 qua uitstraling en in de geschiedenisboeken maakt de kleur van de medaille echter een groot verschil goud straalt behoorlijk meer en de rest van je leven staat er een titel op je naam
1221672 op de olympische spelen is de druk bij mij altijd maximaal geweest
1221673 vijftien jaar geleden stapten wesley sneijder en ik als binkies binnen bij ajax en stonden onze ouders door weer en wind op de toekomst naar ons te kijken binnenkort zitten ze naast elkaar op de tribune van bernabeu mooi h
1221674 als je bij real mag spelen is dat een ongelooflijk grote eer
1221675 dat de twee binkies van toen rafael en wesley nu bij de mooiste club ter wereld spelen is natuurlijk het grootst denkbare compliment voor de jeugdopleiding van ajax

1221701 the workman who was getting ready to cover up the latest mess told me it was the fourth time hes replaced the billboard so the state farm ad was going to be moved to a higher billboard up in churchville and a public service announcement put in its place
1221702 its not about the money its about what you can do with the money
1221703 i cant believe a personal finance blogger would say such a thing
1221704 to encourage physical exercise a large area on the corner of chapel and robinhood roads is reserved for outside activities although the decisions have not been made as to what several activities could be included there i e soccer baseball track type fields etc in addition a planned indoor recreational building of about twenty thousand plus or minus square feet 20 000 sq ft is to be located adjacent to the school building
1221705 so what impact do you think the blog has had on things
1221706 its vital to have this especially after oversight abuse with the big dig has wreaked havoc with taxpayer and toll payers money
1221707 a lot of us are concerned every day about picking up the paper and reading about some other oversight someone forgot its decaying the public trust and our resources so i think we have to act
1221708 if this was in place during years of big dig we would not be in mess were in today
1221709 at the end of the day this is the only way to protect taxpayers on mega projects
1221710 all ive ever received were e mails from clinton asking me to support obama but just because hillary has united forces doesnt mean he should forget to ask
1221711 im a hillary supporter and im protesting that they gave her delegates to obama
1221712 this type of thing where the majority of the people cant even go to it it is not right
1221713 especially in light of the fact that mccain can draw from working class democrats
1221714 we are excited by the unity and support we are seeing in massachusetts as evidenced by the work of clinton and obama supporters coming together to ensure a successful fund raiser in boston
1221715 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1221716 referring to three potential swing states the illinois senator hopes to win in the nov 4 election
1221717 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1221718 i was really flattered that he chose to spend his birthday with us
1221719 what i liked about his speech today was he kept on using the word we it made us feel like it is our movement rather than a politicians campaign
1221720 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1221721 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games

1221726 de olympische medailles zijn de meest begeerde in het judo en de meest waardevolle prijzen die ik heb gewonnen als ik met een vierde plak op de spelen uniek in de geschiedenis kan worden is dat natuurlijk een mooie statistiek maar in de eerste plaats wil ik gewoon weer een medaille winnen
1221727 were sluggish were really sluggish mentally and physically i dont like the way our defensive guys are getting off blocks i think were laying on blocks too much offensively were just not real sharp taking steps and getting angles up front were hitting the ground too much
1221728 mentally were not very sharp especially our young guys our young guys are when they get a little bit tired and theyre trying to think their brains not going real well i think in two or three days from now well start to see our legs coming back a little bit well get a little sharper physically and hopefully well get a lot sharper mentally our old guys are closer but the young guys in some cases guys we think have enough ability physically to play for us right now just arent there mentally so theyre going to have to do a good job concentrating
1221729 were not much different in pads than we are in shells
1221730 i think the pads more than anything keep us from getting the goofy thigh bruises well be about the same as we were today well do more when we get to saturday and we scrimmage but right now its all about learning what to do thats our biggest hurdle right now getting better mentally
1221731 i expect josh to come back where he left off and actually be a little better
1221732 hes got a year behind him in the weight room another year behind him mentally and hes maturing some of the things he might not have been sure of before he has more confidence now as he continues to grow and do the things we ask of him hes going to get better
1221733 brandon may be a little further along than josh because josh strength wise was not where brandon is now
1221734 josh as he came along got stronger but brandons pretty strong right now as far as the mental part of the game brandons about where josh was last year
1221735 of course we havent gotten into pads yet and that will tell us a little more right now as far as the drills and the agility stuff were doing catching the ball theyre doing a pretty good job josh isnt quite 100 percent right now but hes doing well with what were doing anthony cj brandon theyre doing some good things were looking forward to actually hitting and having some contact
1221736 were kind of in the mode right now where were trying to take one running back in each class so we dont get stockpiled with kids that dont have a chance to get reps kind of like we are at quarterback

1221753 in the wisdom of solomon we are told that god created adam deathless god created man for incorruption and made him in the image and of his own eternity
1221754 eternal life is a priceless treasure the gift of god
1221755 man shall never enter into the full idea understanding of eternal life until we rid ourselves of the almost instinctive assumption that eternal life means primarily life which goes on forever and ever
1221756 eternal life is life in the absolute sense life as god has it that which the father has in himself eternal life is the present actual possession of the believer because of his relationship with christ

1221772 can you name any prominent republican that has said that obama is not patriotic
1221773 w e misidentified former congressman bill janklow as a democrat
1221774 we dont feel that he should be able to walk the streets
1221775 hes still going to be able to breathe read walk and talk to his family
1221776 he not only took a general manager he took a sister a mother a grandmother and a friend
1221777 when youre in a depressed state you do a lot of stupid stuff
1221778 i hope every time he closes his eyes he sees my beautiful sister where he left her to go on his shopping spree
1221779 there are a number of things that a neighborhood association is allowed to do that a business organization is not allowed to do
1221780 recognition of this organization as an alternative neighborhood association would open the door to any splinter group in any other neighborhood association who does not want to work with an existing organization which has been recognized by the city council the developers would love the confusion and chaos that would result from that precedent
1221781 i think we find ourselves in this situation in that our lack of focus and priority in our policies and definitions has created a very difficult question of how this issue can be resolved

1221800 the initiative may add as many as three to 5 000 new direct jobs in the united states and about 10 000 to 15 000 indirect jobs in the united states as the united states is able to engage in nuclear commerce and trade with india
1221801 this agreement will deepen the strategic partnership create new opportunities for u s businesses in india enhance global energy security and reduce indias carbon emissions
1221802 diversifying indias energy sector will help it to meet its ever increasing needs and more importantly ease its reliance on hydrocarbons and unstable sources like iran this is good for the united states
1221803 u s india defence relationship derives from a common belief in freedom democracy and the rule of law and seeks to advance shared security interests
1221804 we have already seen strategic benefits from our improving relationship with india indias votes at the iaea on the iran issue last september and this past february demonstrate that new delhi is able and willing to adjust its traditional foreign policies and play a constructive role on international issues
1221805 the ministry has received the representation sent by the alumini association of i i t kanpur to the honble prime minister of 27th june 2008 this is with reference to your meeting in the ministry with the honble union minister of power today and on 25th june 2008 and your memorandum of the same date in respect of river bhagirathi and in continuation of this ministrys d o no 37 47 2008 h ii of june 26 2008 i am directed to say that the government of india commits itself to suitably ensure perennial environmental flow in all stretches of river bhagirathi i have to inform you that the chairman and managing director ntpc has been directed to constitute a high level expert group including your nominee to examine the various technical issues involved in ensuring the required flow in the river bhagirathi to keep the river alive the high level expert group will give its report within three months we shall invite you for discussion as soon as the recommendations of this high level expert group are received in order to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution we would request prof d d agarwal to give up his indefinite fast the government assures you of the highest consideration of your concerns

1221807 one of the easiest ways to significantly bring down number of children and youth who get initiated to tobacco use in india without any budgetary allocation for this public health exercise is to remove depiction of tobacco use in films and tv
1221808 the deal has been pushed forward in india in an anti democratic manner without approval of the parliament in fact in the teeth of opposition by a large majority of parliamentarians
1221809 the deal has the potential of disturbing regional stability and further distorting indias relationships with important neighbours like china pakistan and iran this cannot also but severely undermine the prospects for both vertical and horizontal non proliferation and thereby the prospects for global nuclear disarmament
1221810 most importantly it will be a set back to the environmentally friendly sustainable ways of meeting our energy requirements power from nuclear energy is a failed project in developed countries and the eagerness of the prime minister to clinch the deal fails to generate any enthusiasm among the common people of india neither is nuclear energy a solution to global warming as some experts make it out to be on the contrary the entire nuclear fuel cycle is fraught with danger and exposes human beings to hazardous radiation the world is yet to find a safe way for disposal of radioactive waste a factor which is constraining the growth of nuclear power programmes in the developed countries
1221811 we take strong objection to the joint indo us military exercises that have been taking place for the last seven years with the aim of building interoperability and we demand immediate closure of the counter insurgency and jungle warfare school at vairengte in mizoram the increasing militarization of the india state is also being used to crush civil liberties and democratic movements in the country india must learn a lesson from the history of us military involvement in various parts of the world
1221812 we appreciate the consistent stand taken by the left front a partner in the upa alliance in successfully stalling the indo us nuclear deal up till now and hope that the india specific agreement with the international atomic energy agency iaea will never be finalized even as we note their foresight in foiling the us hegemonic designs in south asia we also expect them to take a principled stand against the nuclear power programme we believe that the iaea safeguards must be implemented nationally and internationally on all declared and undeclared nuclear activities including that of israel and us the government of india must also make its nuclear related activities transparent and accountable to the people especially those who are directly affected by radiation
1221813 fifty seven countries most of them in africa and asia face a severe health workforce crisis who estimates that at least 2 360 000 health service providers and 1 890 000 management support workers or a total of 4 250 000 health workers are needed to fill the gap in india too the shortage of health workers is palpable and may become acute in coming years without prompt action the shortage will worsen
1221814 in general there is a lack of adequate staff in rural areas compared to cities
1221815 there is a direct relationship between the ratio of health workers to population and survival of women during childbirth and children in early infancy as the number of health workers declines survival declines proportionately
1221816 moreover sudden catastrophic events like accidents or natural calamities like floods can quickly overwhelm local and national health systems already suffering from staff shortages or lack of funds
1221817 we need more direct investment in the training and support of health workers
1221818 on academic front csmmu has seen a commendable rise of 40 per cent in the number of research paper publications in past year more than 220 medical research publications in various indexed journals of repute took place which is a landmark in the country
1221819 one of my major concerns is definitely protecting the integrity of medical teaching
1221820 a man who for 30 years has dedicated his life to the service of the poor cannot be branded as a threat to the country
1221821 if gandhiji could have successfully used satyagraha to make the british listen to us then we expect our own government in chhattisgarh and delhi to listen to the voices of thousands of indian citizens from all over the world demanding the abrogation of the draconian laws if every voice raised against the government atrocities is curbed then what is the use of a democracy
1221822 we must do more to raise awareness about this cause we pray for the people in india and usa from various groups such as chattisgarh mukti morcha asha parivar national alliance of peoples movement napm aid and others that are fasting for the release of dr binayak sen
1221823 these protests are not only about the violation of the human rights of dr sen they are also about the ongoing assault on the human rights of the people of chhattisgarh whose lives and lands are being mortgaged to a vision of development that is antithetical to them
1221824 the contentious issue is 600 mw 4x150 loharinag pala dam being built by national thermal power corporation ntpc a central government undertaking the countrys largest power generation company ganga will be put into 26 and 17 km long tunnels leading to its disappearance from its natural course through the stretch the construction is going on in full steam the resultant destruction of the fragile and unique ecosystem will have far reaching consequences not only this all this is done in earthquake zone 5 and terrain full of sedimentary rocks no imagination is required to realize what one earthquake would to the entire region siltation is another problem ganga and all other himalayan rivers carry lots of silt along which will now settle in the reservoirs created by the dams reducing the electricity generation capacity repeated closing of nathpa jhakri dam on satluj in himachal pradesh 4 years after its commission is a fine example
1221825 in the name of development and economic growth in india rural and urban poor have been the worst hit facing displacement and dispossession at an unprecedented scale
1221826 not only the state has overlooked the environmental cost of such hydel projects but also the issues of livelihood and quality of life of those living in areas adjoining the ganga and those who will be displaced by these projects has been appallingly ignored by the state
1221827 electronic surveillance must be conducted in a constitutional manner that affords the greatest possible protection for individual privacy and free speech rights
1221828 fails to provide fundamental safeguards that the constitution unambiguously requires
1221829 a constitution of government once changed from freedom can never be restored liberty once lost is lost forever
1221830 it is not the function of our government to keep the citizens from falling into error it is the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling into error
1221831 he who sacrifices his fundamental liberty in order to obtain a little temporary safety shall have neither liberty nor safety
1221832 violence is not the reply to violence the maoist problem was a product of the decades old government neglect of the basic needs of forested people the only way to overcome the insurgency is to ensure all round development in trouble torn areas
1221833 indias maoist movement is a product of poverty backwardness and neglect of the forested masses by the government any socio economic political problem should be handled with care and development this is the best way to get over the problem
1221834 but surprisingly the chhattisgarh government created the salwa judum in june 2005 which is largely handled by armed anti social elements
1221835 the government has to address peoples core issues by reaching the benefit of the public distribution scheme pds the national rural employment guarantee act nrega and a host of development schemes freed from corruption to their maoist affected peoples land and ensuring that tribals have the right over the natural resources that belong to them traditionally
1221836 under no circumstances should they be moved from their original villages into any kind of camps meeting their basic needs in camps but denying them self dignity will also not solve the problem
1221837 he sen has been victimised because he questioned the salwa judum and the false encounters of innocent tribals
1221838 police have no proof against sen they have falsely implicated him
1221839 it was not too far back when we saw how syed abdul rehman geelani was falsely implicated in the parliament attack case even given the death sentence by a pota special court but ultimately he was acquitted by the high court and the supreme court because of lack of evidence
1221840 development schemes are still not reaching the common people of bastar and the government machinery is mainly responsible
1221841 violence is not natural to human beings people resort to violence and guns only in extreme circumstances and the maoist movement too is by and large the same once the development problems of people are addressed in a sustainable way such that people feel empowered the violence will subside naturally

1221851 god is not a god of confusion if you are confused than it is not from god
1221852 if you are so full of yourself than you cant be full of god
1221853 are you more enticed by the wonders of god than the word of god
1221854 he desires to show himself strong in you and will encourage you to do things that require trust and faith
1221855 you dont have enough you are not able you cant
1221856 i have enough i am able through you i can
1221857 god is a god of right now he calls us not to be regretful over yesterday or worried for tomorrow he wants us to focus on what he is saying to us and putting in front of us right now the enemys voice will focus on the past and the future while the voice of god will focus on today he is the god of right now
1221858 why are we making thank you cards for them they should be making thank you cards for us
1221859 always aim high work hard and care deeply about what you believe in when you stumble keep faith when youre knocked down get right back up and never listen to anyone who says you cant or shouldnt go on
1221860 take as much as you want and pay as much as you feel is appropriate
1221861 facebook totally makes it easy for us to wish you happy birthday even though we never would have remembered and dont know how old you are and really are not that concerned over any of this but still have a great day

1221863 how younger journalists can shape the future of news and storytelling
1221864 it seems fitting to address the terms of engagement under which members of my generation experience information consumption we are coming to professional and personal fruition with the mentality that news is a collective conversation on multimedia platforms not just what i like to call brussel sprouts journalism where an editor at a desk serves up content they think we should read even if we dont want it
1221865 for now people can send comments by e mail and we will post them at end of carberrys column or in separate piece
1221866 we have done and do some hyperlinking but it is extremely cumbersome with our current technology and we lost a full online editor position a few months ago we will be doing more hyperlinking in future and then much more when technology changes
1221867 i picked the name 31 to pay respect to the tremendous success of the traditional newspaper industry if people dont get the reference immediately i hope theyll be interested to discover a tidbit of journalism history its also obviously a reference to the age group im writing to and the thing that comes after the end implying that its not really over
1221868 why wait to rally against the rogues who put us in this mess
1221869 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
1221870 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
1221871 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels therefore the therapeutic window to achieve an optimal risk benefit ratio of gh in individuals with hiv abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance may be very narrow and difficult to achieve
1221872 growth hormone is not yet fda approved for the treatment of abdominal fat accumulation in patients with hiv other more potent strategies to safely increase gh and reduce vat including the use of gh releasing hormone ghrh may be more beneficial in addition strategies using diet exercise and lifestyle change may be more cost effective in the long run than gh particularly in patients with hiv visceral adiposity and insulin resistance in whom changes in glucose may be counterproductive
1221873 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
1221874 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
1221875 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
1221876 can i invite you to a lekker cream slice du geile sahneschnitte
1221877 we are very pleased with the outcome of the end of phase 2 meeting with the fda
1221878 we look forward to continuing our work with the fda and emea to design a global phase 3 program for amigal in fabry disease
1221879 our study supports the idea that doctors are trying to target the neediest patients

1221887 guys are coming around starting to do things that theyre capable of doing things that got them here
1221888 a lot of guys can hit for power and it shows
1221889 weve been getting pitches to hit and right now weve been doing some things with it these four games have been good to get back in the swing of things put together a couple good games and head over to china

1221895 there is currently no effective medical treatment for children with the most common type of congenital hyperinsulinism
1221896 this type of congenital hyperinsulinism is caused by mutations in genes that encode important potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells
1221897 if this peptide can be developed into a treatment for children with this common form of hi we may have a new tool for controlling their insulin levels and managing their disease
1221898 we are extremely pleased with the data emerging from our proprietary 5 ht6 antagonist program
1221899 suvn 502 a potent selective brain penetrant and orally active 5 ht6 receptor antagonist for the symptomatic treatment of alzheimers disease
1221900 the 5 ht6 receptor antagonist suvn 502 enhances acetylcholine and glutamate in rat ventral hippocampus and frontal cortex a microdialysis study
1221901 plan to go but be willing to stay instead of being willing to go and planning to stay
1221902 we are pleased to report continued progress in the development of sirna approaches to gene down regulation as well as an extensive lipid based delivery platform the dila2 platform
1221903 the results of this pre clinical work suggest that a unique combination of both a novel sirna construct within a lipid based delivery formulation has the potential to elicit a potent rnai response and reduce off target activity we believe that a drug discovery platform that has multiple approaches to activating the rnai process as well as a broad delivery capability able to target multiple tissue systems is necessary to successfully develop rnai based therapeutics across all human diseases

1221908 these top line results with boceprevir are very exciting especially given that genotype 1 is the most common and hardest to treat form of hepatitis c
1221909 boceprevir was well tolerated by patients in this study including those who received 48 weeks of boceprevir in the longer duration treatment arms
1221910 these top line results further validate this novel treatment paradigm and the design of our pivotal phase iii studies of boceprevir one in treatment naive patients and one in patients who had failed prior treatment in which all patients will receive 4 weeks of pegintron and rebetol prior to the addition of boceprevir
1221911 additionally this strategy has the potential to reduce the likelihood of the development of resistance by identifying patients who are responders to interferon and ribavirin prior to their receiving a protease inhibitor
1221912 the study shows that eprotirome can be given safely with statins and has significant therapeutic efficacy on ldl cholesterol triglycerides and lipoprotein a over and above the effect of statin the unique clinical efficacy tolerability and safety make this combination a potentially attractive therapy for patients who cannot achieve their treatment goals with statin alone karo bio will proceed with its communicated strategy with the aim to develop eprotirome through phase iii with a partner
1221913 the study demonstrates that our tight junction technology effectively delivers pyy into the body via nasal administration but that the peptide itself is not effective as a single agent for weight loss
1221914 we are pleased that once again our delivery technology has effectively and safely delivered a large molecule via the intranasal route with good tolerability but disappointed that pyy did not show more promising therapeutic effect we believe our intranasal delivery technology continues to demonstrate value as a means of safely administering peptides and proteins and believe that pyy might still prove effective in combination with other weight loss drugs we would like to thank the investigators staff and patients who participated in the trial

1221947 akibatnya kita menjadi tenang bahagia dan merasakan nikmat yang luar biasa keadaan ini muncul akibat otak menyemprotkan saripati kenikmatan dalam tubuh karena kedua belah otak berada dalam keseimbangan kesenangan emosional ini akan meningkatkan sistem kekebalan tubuh tubuh menjadi sehat sel sel yang rusak misalnya akibat kanker bisa diperbaiki

1221949 jadi dalam tubuh kita sendiri sebenarnya sudah terdapat pabrik obat yang mampu memproduksi obat oatan yang mengatur suasana hati dan jenis obat psikoaktif
1221950 dalam hal ini kita bisa menyebut neuropeptide dan reseptor itu sebagai otak yang dapat berjalan

1221966 at the date of the settlement of los angeles a large portion of the country from the central part of the pueblo to the tide water of the sea through and over which the los angeles river now finds its way to the ocean was largely covered with a forest interspersed with tracts of marsh from that time until 1825 it was seldom if in any year that the river discharged even during the rainy season its waters into the sea instead of having a river way to the sea the waters spread over the country filling the depressions in the surface and forming lakes ponds and marshes

1221968 everyone understood those crimes were all done by the same person
1221969 the police were in the house searching it my belongings were taken away my computer and my diary i felt really violated
1221970 in hindsight i should not have crossed that boundary and i guess she might have got the wrong impression i was suffering from depression at the time and that affected my thinking
1221971 i accept i shouldnt have done it but i never expected anything like this i thought id be taken to one side and told to sort it out
1221972 it was 8am and i was still in my pyjamas when the police turned up they took me away and questioned me although by the second time i was questioned i got the feeling they knew there wasnt much in it
1221973 but the waiting has been horrendous its been a year of worsening fear

1221985 the exhibition once upon a time brings together an array of artists that sample from childhood storybooks and fantasy films to form new and inverted versions of the original narrative as one looks back on these tales with an adult view the innocent beliefs and imagination that the child once held become distorted and takes on a more sinister and uneasy image

1222020 m odern evolutionary theory accepts that evolution is still going on therefore man must still be evolving so if a christian accepts evolution he has to accept that god is still using evolution today thus he is still creating but god tells us that he finished his work of creating this is a real dilemma for the theistic evolutionist
1222021 it isnt ok thats not how decent people act in public
1222022 its a shame you dont have the self respect to stop a boy from treating you that way in public

1222026 our goals are more of the same the idea that he said hes iron man in part 1 its one thing to say it and its another thing to actually evolve to the point where you can live in a heroic fashion you know they say the superhero movie always needs to follow and i said who is that guy get him out of here we want to do what worked for us last time in a way that evolves were talking about a guy who is put in an extraordinary circumstance and the people that are around him and how that creates a sense of family and how that disrupts whatever forces that we have to say that are working in his life i like the idea of an iron man 2 that youre able to understand various points of view youre able to touch on some subjects that are a lot more far reaching while still grounding it in entertainment
1222027 sherlock holmes we start october 6th guy ritchies take on it was that its like well be making a contemporary version of a very classic portrayal of exactly how it was but its not telling one of the stories from one of the books or anything like that watson its all there the cool thing about sherlock holmes was hes actually a very skilled martial artist so its going to have elements of that its not just his deduction and all that stuff its going to be a very action packed version of that to me its really exciting
1222028 im always training im big into martial arts were putting together a team of people were going to try to do something a little more transcendent and interesting i love the idea of martial arts and bare knuckle boxing before the queensbury rules where it was all kind of proper it was this real balls to the wall brutal type stuff guy ritchies a martial artist and martial arts student so were going to have a real fun time doing all that

1222031 what im really happy about is that by taking the mummy out of egypt and putting it in china by exploring a different approach to the quest for immortality we now have it clear that the mummy franchise can travel
1222032 now we know that if we want to go to mexico or we want to go to peru we can because theres a cultural truth there of the mummies and these beautiful cultures
1222033 what that is basically a healing walk for anybody when they come to the conference
1222034 the ribbons will be all set up by the aug 14 conference
1222035 in the fall semester of last year i realized just how i really didnt know much about the issue

1222123 we have 700 people or so staying here right now which is largely influenced by the heat because our nightly census has gone up as its gotten hotter

1222132 contract that creates an additional paid holiday eid al fitr a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
1222133 union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
1222134 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
1222135 if this holiday is that important to them make them take it off instead of christmas day and allow all workers to be off labor day most american families have some type of function on labor day
1222136 it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union i guess they are already working on a plan to replace memorial day that means nothing to the muslims so why should we have the right to celebrate it labor day commemorates the plight of workers and the struggle of labor unions to improve working conditions for american workers the muslims will not stop until all of our rights and laws are changed to accommodate their beliefs this will be a new america but it will be their america
1222137 diversity is one of the strengths of our union we may come from different countries and speak different languages but what unites us is the belief that by standing together we can better advance our interests
1222138 the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
1222139 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
1222140 this is america founded by the blood of our forefathers and should not be challenged by somalians hispanics or any other immigrants if they come to america they need to learn our language and our ways they can practice their culture in private if they so please but not shove it down our throats would they let us go there and change there country i have banned tysons products from my home for years because of the illegals they were hiring i am sorry for the producers that are supplying them but tysons has once again crossed the line with the american people labor day was here long before tysons what holiday will be next to be taken away and replaced to accommodate an immigrant this stinks worse than the plant
1222141 disgusting appalling horrifying there just arent enough words to describe this situation there will never be another tyson product in my home ever bedford county and the rest of the nation needs to take notice is this what we are coming to
1222142 dedicated to the social and economic achievements of american workers it constitutes a yearly national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength prosperity and well being of our country
1222143 were in grow season were coming up on harvest season
1222144 so we are coordinating with other agencies out there to fly some more missions and support those types of operations
1222145 theres a water source here on your left right around the power lines so they know there are access roads
1222146 we fly low look for the weed and a lot of sources
1222147 you got to have a water source obviously to grow it any signs of piping generators thats a clue
1222148 we were out on another tip at another location and just like we were today flew in an area spotted them and had to air drop our crews in there to get them
1222149 this is a trafficking organization this is very very big money typically what weve seen in the past are mexican trafficking organizations who control much of this

1222158 el gobierno tiene el compromiso de mantener la tarifa inalterada en santiago durante todo el resto del a o
1222159 significa o que no han le do el proyecto o que est n confundiendo a la opini n p blica
1222160 para las ciudades de menos de 50 mil habitantes habr subsidio para transporte escolar infraestructura y la posibilidad de renovar buses antiguos por lo tanto puedo decir categ ricamente desmintiendo las declaraciones que se han hecho en los ltimos d as que este proyecto tiene beneficios para todas las comunas del pa s
1222161 yo no he dicho que tenga el convencimiento de que va a ser aprobado pero tengo la convicci n de que este proyecto debiera ser aprobado si priman los objetivos sociales por sobre los c lculos pol ticos
1222162 el gobierno tiene el compromiso de mantener la tarifa inalterada en santiago durante todo el resto del a o
1222163 en regiones s requerimos de un proyecto de ley para poder respaldar estos beneficios
1222164 para santiago existen varias opciones en estos momentos estamos tramitando la ley pero s puedo decirles a las personas que puedan tener la tranquilidad que en santiago va a continuar la tarifa fija hasta fines de a o y el sistema va a continuar operando estamos garantizando estas tarifas no gracias a la oposici n sino que a pesar de las acciones de la oposici n
1222165 a m me parece que lo correcto es no s lo solucionar el tema de la regi n metropolitana sino tambi n para el resto de las regiones del pa s un subsidio facilitar a la posibilidad de no subir los pasajes en cambio el 2 constitucional vendr a entre comillas a solucionar el tema de la capital pero no el resto de las regiones de chile
1222166 si vamos a legislar sobre subsidios de la locomoci n colectiva yo lo pondr a para todo el pa s que la oposici n plantee el hecho de llevarlos en dos proyectos de ley me parece que eso si que es un chantaje
1222167 nearly every single possible combination of the childrens meals at kfc taco bell sonic jack in the box and chick fil a is too high in calories
1222168 ninety three percent of 1 474 possible choices at the 13 chains exceed 430 calories an amount that is one third of what the institute of medicine recommends that children aged four through eight should consume in a day
1222169 chilis has 700 possible kids meal combinations but 658 or 94 percent of those are too high in calories including one comprised of country fried chicken crispers cinnamon apples and chocolate milk 1 020 calories and another comprised of cheese pizza home style fries and lemonade 1 000 calories
1222170 only a third of its fresh fit for kids meals which include a mini sub juice box and one of several healthful side items apple slices raisins or yogurt exceed the 430 calorie threshold
1222171 kfc is proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options the kfc information in the report is inaccurate as kfc offers a number of kids meal options well below 430 calories
1222172 on june 30 2008 bkc burger king corp launched a new burger king kids meal that complies with bkcs nutrition criteria
1222173 people may not get a heart attack until their 50s or 60s but arteries begin to clog in childhood
1222174 most of these kids meals appear to be designed to put americas children on the fast track to obesity disability heart attack or diabetes
1222175 the most recent scientific assessment says there is very very slim evidence of the success of weather intervention in increasing decreasing or preventing rain
1222176 in a way you can regard beijing as a demonstration of their weather modification capabilities
1222177 we will see if certain weather conditions will affect beijing and if we need to apply certain techniques
1222178 although the principles behind it are well established it is difficult to prove that a given round of cloud seeding produced a particular effect
1222179 its aircraft alone have undertaken enough missions to fill four yellow rivers the countrys second longest river in the past five years
1222180 modification of clouds and rain are only at the early stages of experimentation

1222192 im the quarterback id rather throw the ball than hand the ball off
1222193 it cant be let me throw the ball 50 times the big east conference you have to be able to run the ball to be successful its something we have to plan on being able to do
1222194 im looking forward to the competition because i want to see it i dont look forward to it in question
1222195 im the quarterback id rather throw the ball than hand the ball off

1222201 i sure hope the packers dont give in to him
1222202 when his agent tells him not to worry about what his teammates think and all that stuff id tell him ive been around a long time and that stuff will come back to haunt you
1222203 i sure hope the packers dont give in to him
1222204 when his agent tells him not to worry about what his teammates think and all that stuff id tell him ive been around a long time and that stuff will come back to haunt you
1222205 everybody knows i love new york i come here quite often i have friends here its a town i love to be in but nothing more

1222207 everybody knows i love new york i come here quite often i have friends here its a town i love to be in but nothing more

1222211 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
1222212 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
1222213 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
1222214 this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
1222215 gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
1222216 we must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake not by mechanical aids but by an infinite expectation of the dawn
1222217 i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life
1222218 i left the woods for as good a reason as i went there perhaps it seemed to me that i had several more lives to live and could not spare any more time for that one it is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular route and make a beaten track for ourselves
1222219 whats even worse is after you had that annoying conversation after youve gone all trough your pockets and dug inside your bags and the cashier finally gives up she would then open some sort of secret compartment or pull out a bag from under somewhere turns out she had change after all
1222220 i do hope that even if and when the ruling is against the players that the clubs would say ok we are now right and we were right to attack
1222221 but let the players play this is what im asking
1222222 im a little bit surprised the clubs are taking such a strong stance i would say not only against fifa but also against the players
1222223 the players deserve also respect when they are asked by their national teams to play
1222224 when cas is taking a decision we are bound by that decision
1222225 any hope that plaintiffs could renew their season tickets left with them
1222226 neither the city of seattle nor the nba are parties here but plaintiffs claim a right to have this court drag the team and the nba back for two more years of games plaintiffs dont intend to buy tickets for or attend at a venue the team no longer has a right to use
1222227 this is absurd no such contract right exists and plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief must be dismissed
1222228 at no time during the conversation did i threaten mr schultz in any way either expressly or implicitly regarding his continuation of this lawsuit or any other matter
1222229 dengan demikian percakapan antar pelanggan flexi di bandung atau dari bandung ke jakarta misalnya benar benar gratis dari menit pertama demikian juga dari jakarta ke tasikmalaya dari serang ke garut dari rangkasbitung ke ciamis dari purwakarta ke cirebon dan lain lain tidak akan dikenakan biaya apa pun
1222230 ini memang sebuah kebijakan drastis yang kami ambil dalam rangka mendongkrak pangsa pasar flexi di wilayah jakarta jawa barat dan banten
1222231 sejauh ini berbagai program promosi yang kami lakukan terbukti berdampak positif pada peningkatan jumlah pelanggan
1222232 ternyata kami sudah hampir mencapai target tersebut dalam waktu enam bulan saja dari data terakhir bulan juni secara nasional pelanggan indosat sudah meningkat hingga 7 9 juta menjadi sekira 32 4 juta pelanggan
1222233 trafik yang menjadi padat itu tergantung pada promo tarif ya kalau menelpon di jam jam tertentu yang tarif promo nya murah angka trafik secara menyeluruh bisa digenjot
1222234 penambahan itu tergantung kebutuhan kita selalu menambah kapasitas per lokasi apabila di suatu lokasi trafiknya terlampau padat kita akan segera menambah kapasitasnya
1222235 kita tidak ada rencana untuk menambah jumlah bts tetapi kita akan menambah kapasitas tiap tiap bts istilahnya bandwidthnya dipertebal
1222236 penurunan kinerja ini dikarenakan anak perusahaan kami telkomsel tidak mampu menahan turunnya pendapatan seluler walaupun pelanggan mereka bertambah ini dikarenakan resulasi baru yang berimbas menurunkan biaya interkoneksi

1222242 in many companies and sectors pay arrangements are still covered by the current agreement if no national agreement emerges and where existing pay agreements have expired claims will be processed in line with established industrial relations procedures
1222243 the collapse of the pay talks further dispels the myth of s supposed competence on the economy the government found it easy to broker a deal between unions and employers when they could pay for it through the proceeds of a debt fuelled boom and explosion in public spending
1222244 now that the government is facing a tougher economic climate its entire economic policy is unravelling with unemployment rising house prices falling business and consumer confidence plummeting and nothing on offer from the government to tackle any of the problems facing the economy
1222245 for the avoidance of doubt about what trade unions were prepared to contemplate in an national agreement we were prepared to accept that it would be somewhat better than inflation for the lower paid whilst it might be something less than inflation for the better paid

1222250 this matter is in the hands of the lawyers so it is inappropriate to make any comment at this stage what we can say though is that for some time ryanair has enjoyed substantial discounts in charges for using stansted airport
1222251 since april 1 2007 this arrangement no longer applies but our charges remain within the limit we are allowed to charge by our regulator the civil aviation authority caa

1222260 i switched to cnn and was pleasantly surprised by obamas plan okay i take that back i was more than pleasantly surprised i was excited and inspired by the ideas that obama spoke about this morning in the birthplace of the auto industry and though i know that this speech was tailor made for michigan and designed to strengthen his poll numbers i believe that this energy plan is the only way forward for our nation and that if obama is serious and dedicated to these issues we may have a solution not only to climate change but to the ailing economy the things that we need to do to stall the oncoming danger of climate change are the very things that obama outlined in his speech we must invest heavily in alternative energy if we dont come up with the capital to take the risk out of these start up industries they will fail we need investment tax credits for solar energy and wind power without them there are major solar projects that will move to europe and the wind farms will not get built here but move to germany our auto industry is near bankruptcy ford and gm have reported the lowest sales in nearly 30 years

1222268 i want you to do me a favour i will talk to the big leaders in the israel defence forces and say hes a good guy we have to help him

1222271 it is the states sovereign right to determine who enters its gates and that the extent of discretion granted to the authorities is very broad
1222272 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead and were talking about attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomenon but a phenomenon that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st pete police and the jena six and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
1222273 ive been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the united states senate and worked to pass legislation to prevent it when i was in the state legislature and i have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target african american and latino communities ive said that repeatedly number two jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that theres an injustice thats been done and we need to change it thats number two when sean bell got shot i put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem
1222274 we have made some terrible mistakes in iraq and it is only by talking about them that we will learn from them
1222275 last autumn we made a mistake which was understandable but not excusable a shia prisoner ahmed al fartusi said he could put a stop to the killings we released 120 of their prisoners and withdrew out of town but when we moved out lawlessness took over as 90 per cent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army known to british troops as the jam had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
1222276 as if the problems were more about a few criminal tribes and families than religious groups baghdad thought basra was easy to solve and didnt fully understand the extent of the problem plus the americans with their obligations in mosul and elsewhere believed basra could look after itself it was compounded by having little guidance from above as to whether we were right to accept the deal
1222277 there was a sense that no one was making policy in london
1222278 wow that beach looks nice especially after the pismo beach disaster

1222285 hidden cameras and surveillance video cameras certainly have a place in police and law enforcement but they have no place in private affairs private property or invasion into peoples private lives and thats exactly what happened here
1222286 if you do something like this theres going to be consequences and repercussions
1222287 doctors said that if he survives half of his body would be paralyzed

1222294 cause why would i show love to the game the game dont show you love back so i wasnt gonna do that and come back out and mess up my image and mess up myself i was going on the strength that i want respect from people who probably dont like me anyway so im gonna stick to what i do and stay being successful and ill do some mixtapes and some futures something like that
1222295 secara teknis setiap jaringan operator di dunia memiliki kemampuan untuk melakukan pemblokiran ponsel melalui bantuan nomor imei namun hal tersebut tidak disarankan di indonesia karena proses registrasi atau keabsahan kepemilikan ponsel yang masih diragukan solusi seperti itu diprediksi dapat disalahgunakan oleh setiap pengguna seluler untuk memblokir ponsel orang lain
1222296 di luar negeri ada pelanggan dengan sistem kontrak atau disebut juga dengan nama subsidi subscriber mereka biasanya adalah pelanggan pascabayar setiap mereka membeli perangkat yang sudah terintegrasi dengan nomor telepon sudah pasti operator mendapatkan data kepemilikan perangkat tersebut dengan jelas perangkat dengan nomor imei sekian memiliki nomor msisdn sim card sekian dengan nama pelanggan a dan bertempat tinggal dengan alamat yang jelas
1222297 kejelasan data seperti itulah yang tidak dimiliki oleh pelanggan seluler di indonesia sehingga tidak ada keharusan bagi operator untuk melakukan proses pemblokiran meskipun alasannya pencurian ponsel

1222486 on the face of it the change appears foolhardy after all the message seems to suggest that potential customers might have to waste their time dialing and redialing the number until they finally reach a sales representative
1222487 that skeptical view however ignores the power of the principle of social proof in brief when people are uncertain about a course of action they tend to look outside themselves and to other people around them to guide what they do
1222488 consider the mental image likely to be generated when you hear
1222489 now consider how your perception of the popularity of the product would change if you heard the phrase
1222490 after all goes the thinking if the phone lines are busy then other people like me who are also watching this infomercial are calling too

1222496 its a good idea to know where your product stands in the louis vuitton to walmart spectrum and market yourself accordingly
1222497 this is because its a supported product and im the only
1222498 it only has to be good enough so people can give themselves permission to buy something they already want
1222499 my personal choices have been haphazard over the years i dont claim to have any special insights
1222500 committed serious violations that completely undermine the public trust in our healthcare delivery system
1222501 unum one of the nations leading disability insurers has long had a reputation for unfairly denying and delaying claims unums claims handling abuses have consistently been the subject of regulator and media investigations
1222502 in california where nearly one in every four claims for long term care insurance was denied the california department of insurance launched an investigation into unum

1222508 the juggernaut the best and biggest military force in the world lumbers on doing what it knows how to do best it is unwilling to rethink its future unable to let go of the past like the shark it must keep feeding only now it is feeding on itself
1222509 but if our troops were in afghanistan and not iraq then the branch of terrorists called al qaeda in iraq would have never formed in iraq but in afghanistan instead which is a much more difficult terrain to fight terrorists on demanding more resources and arguably costing more lives

1222513 you walked into the dinner party wearing high heels with your jeans at that moment i knew wed be friends
1222514 no strings relationships have helped cure me of love addiction all my life ive been in long term monogamous relationships i had to break that pattern by not allowing myself to have a relationship for a year stopping myself from committing to men i havent been celibate ive had lots of dates and lots of sex but i havent been pushing to turn a date into a relationship this has been a huge thing for me
1222515 itty biz where we curse for you so that you can maintain a good impression

1222522 one of my favorite classes in ninth grade was biology
1222523 going to college in germany would be just as great because they have terrific universities and i love the language they have a no tolerance policy for litter and therefore it is a rather immaculate country and they also have a good economy

1222525 its not good for teens to be watching so why put it on a show
1222526 i really think we should put the innocence back in our children
1222527 it may not be morally right but we have to accept peoples differences
1222528 i really enjoy seeing the venturers take a step out of their comfort zone to do some of these activities
1222529 it gives you a chance to do something that either you or your friends would never do in their lives
1222530 the first thing i am going to do when we get to the island is to kiss the ground
1222531 the holy scriptures are the only rule of faith throw aside all merit of works and look for salvation to the grace of god alone beware of a religion which consists of outward observances it is better to keep your heart pure before god than to abstain from meats one alone is your head jesus christ bishops and presbyters are equal they should be the husbands of one wife and have their children in subjection
1222532 parts of britain which were unconquerable and unapproachable by the roman armies yielded to christ
1222533 as long as theyre not predators or messaging me and stuff like that
1222534 i think it gets a little freaky when your teacher or parents are on facebook its an invasion of my world

1222536 and now i cant play at the mall playground anymore the sign says for kids under 5
1222537 its all playing all the time in pre school tons of toys and nothing but playing once you get to kindergarten the fun ends
1222538 its going to be here before you know it this decade has gone by like this
1222539 the increasing use of very public attacks has had a striking effect on morale far beyond the immediate victims
1222540 every person in the tribal areas owns a gun and has fighting abilities the taliban force each family to send one of their members to join their fight against their rival group those who refuse risk having their homes demolished and a heavy fine is imposed on them
1222541 they compel our youth to join their fight or face penalties that may vary from losing their home a heavy fine or going into exile
1222542 of course christ is the truth and only he has words of eternal life
1222543 like most intelligent women she prefers the company of sleaze
1222544 of course christ is the truth and only he has words of eternal life
1222545 how the rejection of humanae vitae came about the malign results of that rejection and the way back to the truth
1222546 pope john paul ii called dissent from humanae vitae the great lie this lie remains in canada like a festering cancerous wound can it be cured
1222547 by virtue of the mandate entrusted to us by christ
1222548 which has been handed down from the beginning until now
1222549 they may not simply follow their own fancy but must be ruled by conscience and conscience ought to be conformed to the law of god in the light of the teaching authority of the church
1222550 confessors are assailed by doubts they no longer know what to answer
1222551 fecundity is an obligation but we should concentrate less on the fecundity of each sexual act and more on the totality of married life we must affirm that the intimate union of the couple finds its legitimacy in itself when it is not directed toward procreation
1222552 to the house of commons standing committee on health and welfare on change in the law of contraception
1222553 we consider article 150 which forbids giving information about contraception as well as the sale or distribution of contraception an inadequate law to day a large number of our fellow citizens believe that this law violates their rights to be informed and helped towards responsible parenthood in accordance with their personal beliefs
1222554 we do not conceive it our duty to oppose appropriate change in article 150 of the criminal code indeed we could easily envisage an active co operation and even leadership on the part of lay catholics to change a law which under present conditions they might well judge to be harmful to public order and the common good
1222555 surprisingly the canadian catholic conference of the roman catholic church did not oppose the law stating that canada was a pluralistic society but that roman catholics should not practise contraception
1222556 to reach a judgement different from that of the holy father
1222557 the christian experience of vast numbers of catholics and the witness of other christian churches
1222558 may be safely assured that whoever honestly chooses that course which seems right to him does so in good conscience
1222559 hoho for i have stolen another 25 cents from someone on the internet my dastardly deeds know no bounds
1222560 so rare that smoking it is like killing a unicorn

1222562 its our very government that is the terrorist organization weve been hearing about
1222563 these are gals who while not lesbians dress like guys young guys well into their 30s who leap into games of pickup basketball with male friends while the rest of us watch wanly from the sidelines who affect a wry detachment from their sexs conventional concerns of shoe shopping man hunting and family
1222564 young feminists just want to go wild and pole dance
1222565 while there will probably always be generational misunderstandings within feminism keeping our complexities in mind helps ensure that the dialogue stays productive
1222566 women like men are diverse and will never vote as a bloc
1222567 in fact opera news got it wrong and that aria is not being changed into a trio there are some cuts in act one and the car aria is being re worked the end of it will be small trio which blends into the next scene
1222568 ps i think its awesome that u respond in an actual friendly manner and also seem sincere when doing it i ran across a few sites similar to yours prior and got rude responses if any response in return

1222574 you have today and tomorrow left to buy seo school with the coupon code
1222575 buy it with the discount at 30 then sell it to people and dont tell them about the discount so they pay 39
1222576 as far as the 1 5 copies shes right if thats all anyone can do then they need to revisit their strategies as an affiliate marketer this is just common sense and no reflection on naomi
1222577 you might want to rethink the whole affiliate marketing thing
1222578 if youre not currently getting results then you should quit
1222579 close the door dad dont open drive away quickly ah
1222580 we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
1222581 justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus
1222582 what does a healthy church member look like in the light of scripture
1222583 because they feared being prosecuted should the program be halted and exposed
1222584 cheneys argument for not releasing innocent detainees theyll all get lawyers
1222585 it is also wildly inaccurate to claim as some have done that at least 30 former guantanamo detainees have been
1222586 because they feared being prosecuted should the program be halted and exposed
1222587 i dont know why i posted that i was told to and i do what im told
1222588 a more detailed picture of who the guantanamo detainees are how they ended up there and the purported bases for their enemy combatant designation
1222589 todos son responsables de lo que le ha ocurrido a mi esposa
1222590 tan feliz porque se dirig a a hacer lo que m s le gustaba en este mundo montar a caballo

1222594 si esto pasara en una obra inmediatamente el empresario ser a detenido si alguien de la calle tiene esa responsabilidad todos los superiores de mi mujer tambi n la tienen

1222597 dont let november 4 find you on the open road
1222598 and thats the best hoo ah a man can get
1222599 we did a poll on the way in and were split down the middle
1222600 we need a commander in chief who will win the war in iraq but will win it the right way
1222601 i want us to come home with victory and honor
1222602 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1222603 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1222604 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1222605 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1222606 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1222607 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1222608 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1222609 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1222610 thats a lie damn mainstream liberal media you liberals hate america drill here drill now
1222611 it was sen obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies
1222612 also not mentioned is the 400 000 nz555 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1222613 more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1222614 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1222615 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1222616 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1222617 i can tell you categorically that national will not cut spending to education
1222618 we are committed to increasing education funding at the same rate that labour has budgeted for and we will work to see more of that spent on schools and less on bureaucracy
1222619 i was persuaded to determine that a question of privilege was involved because of the high public interest and the implication for the reputation of members and the institutions of parliament
1222620 hi dear come ova and work here im gonna continue sleeping cause im hung ova
1222621 airport road is not an officially recognized address for county road 42 in simcoe county
1222622 the 911 system implemented in the mid 90s designated another road that travels past the collingwood regional airport that being said its still widely referred to as airport road by the citizens of stayner
1222623 many of our citizens are employed in the larger centres near us these include barrie alliston collingwood and even the gta
1222624 there has been a great deal of growth for many years but there are a lot of long time citizens this is a place where you know your neighbours our largest industry is agriculture beef dairy pork vegetable cash crop and the spin offs from the farms helps our commercial sector
1222625 the chamber of commerce runs music in the park for 10 weeks throughout the summer
1222626 the lions club holds an annual summer dance where they raffle a vintage pick up truck the 37th year this past summer and the kinsmen hold an annual comedy night the heritage society holds an annual heritage day each july and then there are sidewalk sales christmas light up night all the usual small town events that help to build the sense of community we enjoy
1222627 as many as 15 000 vehicles drive through our downtown each day during the ski season and the peak summer months
1222628 getting them to stop could be the key to our commercial success i believe we need to provide an attractiveness that will draw them back for a visit after they have reached their destination got unpacked settled in et cetera it will always be difficult to compete with collingwood on that front but wasaga is a summer destination with a growing full time population that shops extensively outside of wasaga so we are capitalizing on that
1222629 we counted all the butts about six weeks ago then well do it again in another couple weeks to see how effective the program is
1222630 for the last year or so weve identified the attraction of an nhl camp as a legitimate tool to create economic and tourism development in a traditional time when the industry can use a boost
1222631 we were very lucky to have florida and columbus come to summerside for a few days
1222632 our goal is to get a whole camp a whole 10 days that creates an opportunity to do a number of activities and events that a few days dont allow you to do
1222633 that allows us to continue the relationship with the national hockey league with the ultimate goal of attracting a training camp
1222634 joe found out that i played hockey and he trained some hockey guys in the summer time
1222635 i tried that out and i really liked it and i stuck with it
1222636 its one of the best programs going i think conditioning wise its something new and it helps you in many ways its a great program
1222637 what are the cultural foundations and current trends that will shape this marketplace
1222638 i was diagnosed with rp a while ago but it was one of those things i didnt really worry about
1222639 but in the last six months it had gotten a lot worse
1222640 this is the biggest pop weve had in the past few weeks its been very slow some nights were lucky to have one or two tables upstairs
1222641 most of our crews down river especially those working in the small boats have been brought back its too dangerous to have those boats on the river trying to get the on water recovery
1222642 id love for them to get it done very soon it would be a huge boost to our business
1222643 i am looking forward to fighting again at the mgm grand and challenging malignaggi for his title
1222644 las vegas is like a second home to me the fans treat me like gold and i promise them another exciting value for money fight
1222645 i am thrilled to be involved in the biggest 140 pound fight of 2008
1222646 this will be my first fight in las vegas which makes it all the more exciting
1222647 hatton is an aggressive puncher who swarms his opponents from start to finish while malignaggi is one of the purest boxers in the game today
1222648 es el momento de la igualdad el salario digno y la inversi n productiva
1222649 i think ojay can go out with a win tonight
1222650 i think ojay could have been given a warning it was his last fight but ojays always been a bit crazy so this could be the right way for him to finish his career
1222651 obviously i wanted to go out with a win ojay was going to win id have got him back to the corner and hed have improved he was over eager in the first round i knew we could have beaten that kid but im not disappointed ojay has always been controversial
1222652 the main thing is that ojay didnt get hurt in his boxing career he didnt get beaten up tonight either he got disqualified for being a crazy bastard
1222653 ojay apologised for what happened afterwards but why should he apologise to me i feel ok in reality the ref should disqualify him because it was seconds after the bell but under the circumstances they could have let ojay carry on with a warning and taken points off ojay didnt shake the kid up or knock him out but that is the way it goes ojay has been controversial in the past people say i have been controversial as well so maybe it is fun to go out this way
1222654 if ojay comes back ill fucking knock him out ojay doesnt need to come back to boxing because he has a life to get on with i wanted to be there for him tonight to be honest i wanted to do the match making for him but they had already brought this kid ambler in
1222655 i went out of boxing the way i wanted to go out it was a small show and i was working with a guy i made a promise too
1222656 ive had a great career in boxing but that night against kostya tszyu will always be the night i remember it was a great night i got to see ricky go all the way and achieve the things i always felt he had the potential to achieve
1222657 i always bring my cameras when i go to places like that
1222658 ive always loved going to your part of the country theres just so much to see
1222659 its photography an art and a skill that im thrilled to have had the opportunity to develop because its a form of expression i think like music there are good photographs and great photographs and a lot in between
1222660 id much rather be really good at a lot of things than great at anything i think greatness brings a lot of pressure that you dont necessarily need as an adult
1222661 then youre forced to compete at such a high level that failure can be devastating
1222662 theres an assortment of things that i do in the show realizing not all audiences are the same not all ages are the same and not all musical tastes are the same
1222663 ive always said its not important that everyone leave saying hes the best singer theyve ever heard but it is important that everyone leave saying ive enjoyed that
1222664 when i do a hit the audience becomes a part of the show they sit there and they sing
1222665 you play the hits so many times that they tend to lose their magic after the 1 000th time
1222666 there are songs that ive recorded that no ones ever heard before i occasionally for my benefit do a song for me
1222667 its a real gift for me to be able to still compete
1222668 i have never been a person who got caught up in my success or anyone elses success
1222669 there are some jobs that survival is based on your ability to accept rejection and this is one of them
1222670 i never thought i was a particularly good singer but i always felt that i had a real gift for picking great songs when a song touches me i think im capable of making it touch other people
1222671 you are so lucky it may even be possible to save your home and or new products if applicable but i also feel that we all have a large companies everything that is not universally shared
1222672 he devoured my fine pink silk stockings in a frenzied gaze impossible to describe he began to whisper indecencies i replied with suggestions even more lewd
1222673 a pesar de la incertidumbre econ mica espa a seguir necesitando nuevos inmigrantes laborales

1223040 i loved ironside my family gathered each week around our tv trays in front of the set our evening meal complete with iceberg wedge salad perfectly timed to coincide with the electronic siren sound that kicked off quincy jones thrilling theme song
1223041 were running at 180 000 so far this year in the red the projection taking us out through the rest of the year will probably make that number grow if we dont start receiving more contributions from individuals
1223042 ive actually lived overseas for two years ive been stationed somewhere else and when the uso does send care packages like that its like getting a little bit of home from the united states because youre away from home youre not around youre friends youre not around your family and its nice to get a little bit of home from somewhere

1223046 the thing you dont understand about the universe is that the designated hitter rule is genius and the national league will never fully recover
1223047 the thing you dont understand about the universe is tomatoes are a fruit a fruit that beguiles the mind but cleanses the soul
1223048 the thing you dont understand about the universe is michael jackson actually died during that pepsi accident not many people know this he was replaced by a robot that ran a windows based operating system and the antivirus subscription expired after bad that explains everything because in essence the current michael jackson is really infected machine responsible for all of the spam in the world including that myspace porn spam that you always click on thinking that some random girl wants to be your friend

1223052 sweden cant solve the file sharing copyright conflict in a way thats radically different
1223053 still the change has to start somewhere so i think the stim proposal is a good initiative to start an international debate
1223054 awareness on the importance of copyright for the availability of content
1223055 things i will try to do this year that i failed to do last year
1223056 i can make out a vague guess as to what the letter is do you still want me to guess
1223057 ok so ill need to inject this into a vein any arm that you prefer
1223058 nothing im just looking for the right kind of vein
1223059 hmm thats weird i can see the veins in your hand
1223060 thats weird like weird like somethings wrong or just odd
1223061 oh let me look for something you can throw up in
1223062 this happens to everyone and then five minutes they feel fine
1223063 scared that the wolfram and hart miasma might pollute your noble soul
1223064 im simply curious why you want to celebrate your byzantine triumph at wolfram and hart
1223065 maybe because this is the site of my diabolical triumph
1223066 or maybe just maybe its because ive been wallowing in my triumphs and i need you to remind me of the error of my ways
1223067 dont worry ill make sure nobody ever sees the brave and shining wesley wyndam pryce entering the sin den
1223068 read it for me or i warn you your tip
1223069 congratulations on your new position youve earned it love you know who
1223070 though im always reminded of the blake poem when i see a red rose in full bloom
1223071 and then some nonsense about worms and sex being evil and deadly
1223072 i didnt know wolfram and hart paid its minions to be literary critics
1223073 fruits sweeter than honey from the rock stronger than man rejoicing wine clearer than water
1223074 though at least no one need ever name you false about yourself
1223075 and yet the juice never turns to wormwood does it wes
1223076 no matter how many sweet sister lizzies offer to give you the right fruit to suck clean porphyria worships you and instead of looking the other way your heart swells
1223077 if you say the word bicycle i will have you eliminated by a colombian death squad
1223078 im not entirely sure its a good idea but if you feel the need go ahead
1223079 why are you going to have me eliminated by a colombian death squad
1223080 id just point out that theres a certain intense tackiness in taunting a wounded woman over a man youve said you have no interest in when shes helping you and rather notably not going after you despite the number of opportunities shes had to reduce you to tears or worse
1223081 it would appear that cordelias been possessed according to my sources
1223082 my sources agree with yours do you think its tied to the first
1223083 the first is too busy screwing around with the slayer line for reasons that make little sense this power seems interested in corporeal manifestation and you know what that means
1223084 world domination slaughter possibly chanting in its honor to a drumbeat
1223085 probably on the edge of anemia and exhaustion but thats why im going to save the world and then ask for a lengthy vacation with excellent doctors and mai tais
1223086 i mean i know im whore tastic as compared to the virginal goodness but i was fairly serious about the vacation
1223087 gunn and connor should be coming in from patrol soon and hopefully lornes finished the sanctuary spell
1223088 not about you and not about cordelia why would she kill you
1223089 im serious this thing has covered its tracks very well it manipulated us into bringing back angelus after erasing itself from this dimension it took out the sun wolfram and hart la and managed to do a credible cordelia after convincing her that she was doing the right thing by becoming a higher being
1223090 why didnt the beast kill you and why havent the ten bazillion vampires in town for darkapalooza gone after the stench of fresh flowing blood in the sewer and when angelus failed to get you why was she so hell bent on killing you
1223091 as much as im fond of myself youre implying a destiny type thing which is no good at all
1223092 i think we need to find wolfram and hart records
1223093 because such a thing never occurred to me while i bled and occasionally hallucinated in the sewers
1223094 and when was the last time that the level boss was more important than that kids
1223095 last i checked the stigmatic was the emergency backup lawyer done good right
1223096 if lindsey had a spine id be dog food literally i guess drusilla must have smelled that on him in the wine cellar
1223097 so i sing lorne tells me im still just the cosmic pippin and we go back to work right
1223098 every time i see your face i think of things impure unchaste
1223099 looks like we need to keep evil mcbeal alive given that shes about the only person whose ego is big enough to withstand the thing in cordy
1223100 good and evil dont quite mean the same thing they used to not when a trip to the higher realms leaves you with evil inside angelus is our way out of the dark et cetera apparently miss things part of that
1223101 wow thats a ringing assessment of my potential for heroism
1223102 how do i stop the upcoming apocalypse huh do i bleed on cordy maybe i outsass her while wes takes angelus by himself
1223103 you were closer when you were thumbing through this miscellany
1223104 you know sex magicks are almost always a bad idea people who have no business seeing each other naked end up covered in fluids and then it just gets professionally awkward
1223105 and yet were all quite agreed that the end of the world is much more awkward than a threesome
1223106 and i bet it specifies two women and one man
1223107 those of us without overdeveloped madonna whore complexes that is
1223108 i think itll heal up fast but dont go running around in the sewers and watch the athletic sex maam
1223109 im supposed to drink water look at the ceiling and let myself heal up of course i bet youre about to tell me that we need my blood to satisfy the gods right
1223110 you are going to stop angelus and evil delia with the help of the crazy slayer gunns gone to get there is no unity here
1223111 once we succeed well be able to contact wolfram and hart
1223112 you would not believe what goes down besides every student
1223113 no evil schemes no remorse either but im not plotting betrayal from my sickbed im tired i fucked fred which was on my top ten list of things id do when hell froze over you people think i have a destiny
1223114 and if you didnt realize that before youre clearly dumber than you appear

1223149 in fact can i just come in i want to surprise her
1223150 i dont understand why you think a new wardrobe wont be helpful
1223151 if im going to pursue a new career path then im oh my god lilah your heads on straight and youre alive
1223152 but you are a world of not dead i thought your boyfriend got all chop choppy i missed the funeral but i had a benefit for all those victims of the beast and it wasnt like i got an invitation
1223153 reports of my demise were well not hugely exaggerated but lets say they were a little confused and now im back and i havent felt this great in years and hello whos this lindsay
1223154 this is my brother michael michael this is lilah morgan
1223155 why didnt you tell me your third brother was nothing like gob and buster
1223156 after what happened with gob and with buster and with dad you told me bluth men were poison and if we wanted to stay friends no more family mixing remember
1223157 bubba is that your name buster i cant keep you guys straight so youre the youngest one right
1223158 i mean your hair is neat and youre super tall i think thats great
1223159 you bleeeeep those are jimmy bleeep choos what the bleep you sick get away from me go you incompetent bleeep mamas boy
1223160 you know the bluths real estate moguls in orange county i think he was in love with lilah cuz you always want to marry the girl just like the girl who dominated dear old dad
1223161 i spent six months tanning in some toasty hot southern regions and let me tell you im through with heat waves but on the plus side ive got the body of a twenty five year old now and its something to behold when im all done up
1223162 i bet that crazy boyfriend of yours will be so jealous
1223163 actually im kind of avoiding him because the last thing i need in my life are sexy scruffy british men who are great at bleep no matter how much they also know how to shoot fence and drive a sports car at 100 miles an hour while bleep you know
1223164 well just have to find you someone cute and sane
1223165 now tell me all about whats going on with your family because im here for the bluth family
1223166 why didnt you tell me he was mature attractive and not repellent
1223167 besides last i talked to you it was all about this wesley guy wesley wesley wesley the best lay in forty seven states and four countries shotgun and motorcycle and accent guy with that and the bluth family ban it wasnt much use to point out that michael was a great guy you and michael wont work out hes hard working boring kind of a drag really nice but not exciting
1223168 with the bills going directly to wolfram and harts corporate expense account
1223169 i saw a pair of sandals at neimans that were calling your name lindsay
1223170 all i need is one teensy favor thatll make your brother and your best friend very happy and then there will be shoes and shopping
1223171 and then uncle gob was like hey im just saying that you two act like youre closer than friends if you know what im saying and lilahs like you mean we behave like family instead of the sleazy guy at the bar whos like ooh lipstick lesbians
1223172 dont say ass its inappropriate for a girl your age
1223173 jeez i was just trying to give an accurate depiction of events to george michael dad after all thats the key to any performance isnt it
1223174 whats going on wheres your mom and why were you about to say ass
1223175 an old friend of the bluth family is back in town
1223176 i thought she got beheaded in an unfortunate axe murdering incident and lindsay ditched the funeral because it was too depressing to imagine lilah not in couture or one piece
1223177 i was so upset when she died its great to hear that the news and the mourners and mom were all wrong about that axe murdering
1223178 why are you back already couldnt you get michael interested in a game of risk or something
1223179 buster why are you so happy its not good for your blood pressure
1223180 but she was out about and showing lindsay a good time on her american express card if you know what i mean and i think you do
1223181 how do you think she managed to fake an axe murder i mean i knew the bitch was good but thats a trick
1223182 that womans always been burning with bad juju but she all but admitted it today she said shed spent time in the southern hemisphere and clearly it was with a voodoo well technically voudou priestess to restore her
1223183 though it would explain busters fixation what do you know about zombies gob
1223184 fortunately so far shes only lindsays friend and its no big loss if lilah eats
1223185 close enough hear one drunken antic youve heard em all
1223186 are you doing anything tuesday night we could ah go out for dinner after work maybe drinks
1223187 i mean if you want it to be a date its a date but not if youre not
1223188 she was telling me that she was interested in getting to know you better tobias and i should meet you guys at the club you know to make sure things are going okay
1223189 okay mom thinks lilahs a savage cannibal zombie one guess where she got that idea from
1223190 does mom know where im going on my date couldnt you and buster distract her or tell her that you heard wrong that were not going on a date date that its business
1223191 usually i dont put much into superstitions but in my studies of judaism ive learned about a golem so if shes got a tattoo on her arm that looks like a gang symbol make sure to wipe off the first level because that should dissolve her i think
1223192 and its one date for all i know shell be chased off before eight can we get back to business
1223193 thats where a good match is made son in the boardroom
1223194 but no i want the best and youre the best at coming up with esoteric charities i mean hoop sheer genius
1223195 except for the jewish anti defamation league coming after us
1223196 i want more along those lines think of how many people in los angeles need help and dont even know it
1223197 thisll show michael hes not the only one who can work
1223198 oh youre so the best lets go shopping for date wear
1223199 buster this is a date since when do you come along on my dates
1223200 mom can take you to all the scary visual places she wants but this is my date its private and you cant come
1223201 im the new director of charity functions for wolfram and hart pr
1223202 just one drink okay lindsay then michael and i are going to take off after all double dating is so very much eleventh grade
1223203 well have to get acquainted in the car i guess
1223204 i had a meeting with this demon of a client who was demanding i move space time so he could have a certain event on a certain day which was impossible then my boss got involved and ker pow blood and guts everywhere
1223205 somebody had to have lipo in time for their twentieth high school reunion and
1223206 admit the truth youre a vicious cannibal zombie who wants to eat my brothers brain before seducing my sister into your evil ways
1223207 please let me have my date please ill buy you and gob a new television or new channels whatever you need to entertain yourself just go before this gets embarrassing more embarrassing
1223208 you stay out of this michael this is between me and the cradle robber
1223209 dont deny that youve entranced buster look at him hes trying to get in and save you
1223210 how did gob and mom even know to come here anyway
1223211 gob swore that hed use the voodoo truth spell on me if i didnt tell and that might violate oaths ive taken
1223212 vicious cannibal lesbian zombies are often hard to spot with the naked eye
1223213 and then we can get out of here and go somewhere where people arent calling me a zombie cannibal lesbian over rum and coke okay
1223214 must you sabotage every chance i get for a nice enjoyable date
1223215 that vicious harpy has buster ensnared and lord knows lindsay was always a lost cause
1223216 im getting my law firm back law firm back law firm back and when i do the bluth familys going to find itself back on top
1223217 you finally found a girl who isnt bleep and whos got some nice legs too pity your mother tells me shes a cannibal zombie but youve got to respect the work ethic
1223218 thats between me and my late night friends of the underworld
1223219 first you ensnare my poor helpless little buster and you always worked your magic on lindsay but my husband thats one step too far miss morgan
1223220 stick to the lesbian vicious bitchery because when you combine that with voodoo zombie cannibalism thats when youve gone too far especially when youre threatening our family
1223221 but if you say the words voodoo zombie or lesbian in my presence ever again i might have to show you what my cabana boy jose taught me about emasculating a man with a salad fork
1223222 well yeah but thats because he had those parasites attached to his sinking ship
1223223 look michael i know that youre worried your father told me to do something illegal but it was simply good sound advice
1223224 are you really going to listen to what your mother says about me the last time she was sober ronald reagan was the actor playing governor of california
1223225 you think just because you have voodoo powers i cant take you
1223226 ask the last girl who tried to date michael and give me lip
1223227 come on lucille let me show you what the power of voodoo has done for me
1223228 im not sure i can handle a girlfriend who uses pleasure to further business
1223229 but youre afraid ill do something crazy after a year of craziness
1223230 fine wasnt really looking forward to being the zombie girlfriend anyway
1223231 ill see you at the club and talk to me about that job
1223232 taking the moral high ground sneaky bitch youre better off
1223233 hes such a sweet silly fool wesley carries two guns with him at all times and buster announced that he was in love with me and he wanted to be my wife apparently wes thought he said he was going to make me his russian mail order slave and there was a scuffle is there anything i can do pay the medical bill send flowers
1223234 i think maybe staying away from the family would be the most effective
1223235 im sorry michael i guess you can kind of tell from the faking my own death thing and the psychotic english boyfriend that im not the kind of woman who finds healthy relationships but i really respect you for the work youve done to keep your family and your company together its inspiring
1223236 look lilah about the date im sorry it went so badly
1223237 i like you michael i think we have a lot in common and we could have a good time together
1223238 despite the fact my mother referred to you as an undead zombie succubus trying to suck the lifeblood out of the bluth family
1223239 and the part where buster might start following you around if the lucilles allow it
1223240 if youre okay with the fact that my ex boyfriend is a axe wielding underworld thug and ive done some crazy things in my life
1223241 you want to lilah im not sure im comfortable about that right next to busters room and besides what if someone comes in
1223242 consider it a down payment for what i owe you for being so nice to me
1223243 just lets not tell lucille until we make it all the way through an actual date
1223244 but i think michael might have fallen under her savage cannibal voodoo queen spell
1223245 as long as youre wearing your juju bag well deal with michaels little zombie problem later
1223246 michael shes a vicious zombie bitch with no scruples who used your father to commit corporate espionage and get away scot free
1223247 she gave lindsay a job as wolfram and harts charity publicist and i think shes responsible for tobias new position as assistant to funny farm
1223248 when are you going to marry her i think shes clearly a part of the family already and think of how happy buster would be to have lilah as a sister lilah bluth has a ring to it after all
1223249 thats brilliant old man simply brilliant is your sister by any chance single
1223250 i mean really like i want to drink her sherry so much that she needs to put a lock on the cabinet that was totally harmony
1223251 thats the kind of thing she should be locking up not the liquor cabinet
1223252 so should we bag the makeover are you too freaked
1223253 come on were going to my room because i am so not in the mood for any more surprises
1223254 why would she waste time on her boobs if shes that horny already
1223255 so she could make whimpery sex noises while she played with them
1223256 if they really think we just sit around masturbating and waiting for a big penis to make us happy theyve got to be on some serious serious drugs
1223257 wow i guess we know why shes mary honey dont we
1223258 we can just ignore it and i can do your makeup
1223259 its kind of hard to ignore when mrs busch from next door knows the best place to serve cake
1223260 makes you wonder why guys are into that stuff doesnt it
1223261 yeah with the moaning and the rubbing and the gratuitous licking
1223262 do you think were betraying the sisterhood if we do

1223275 hes struggling he is weak but he is in good spirit

1223301 the mention in the last statement that downside growth risks appeared to have diminished somewhat now looks like a premature conclusion
1223302 the extension and enhancement of the liquidity facilities suggests the fed remains concerned about financial stability and thus is unlikely to raise rates in the near term

1223630 denial can be seductive but it has an insidious side effect for all the peace of mind deniers think they get by saying it isnt so the fall they take when faced with new violence is all the more unsettling

1223666 theres always a gray area about what caused what first

1223683 the younger generations dont value that dvd case or box set that the older generations do
1223684 if the movie industry doesnt embrace digital sales the younger generation could turn to gaming and social networking and other alternative forms of entertainment
1223685 when you sell a physical dvd youre making a lot more money than if you sell the movie online
1223686 the best way to help reorient the government is for an immediate action plan from congress many economic policy mistakes were made in the past two and a half years
1223687 for the time being the question of the treaty is pointless
1223688 but his tax plans and their likely economic consequence are very much a plan for catastrophe doubling the tax in invested capital and ratcheting up the top tax bracket to an effective 60 will plunge the nation into a real depression not a recession or a downturn or a correction or a slowdown a depression mccain needs to hammer this point home again and again and again in his advertising he has to put top level economists on television talking about what the obama tax program will mean to america obama is suspect as an ideological liberal anyway and nobody thinks he has the experience to be a good president so the potential to scare voters by accurately elaborating what his tax plans will mean to the entire country not just the rich on whom the burden will directly fall is enormous when obama says he will only tax the rich its like saying he wont shut down the entire ship just the engine room if mccain just talks about obamas tax program in the abstract most voters will shrug and note that the tax hikes wont really apply to them only 2 of americans earn more than 200 000 a year and only 6 make more than 100 000 but if mccain explains the economic impact of obamas tax proposals on all americans he will score points and could score a knockout

1223693 if i go to heaven ill be bored as hell
1223694 this record felt like and still feels like from the writing to the recording a reclaiming of my own independence
1223695 you begin to get yourself hung up on other peoples expectations and i dont think i do my best work when i think about what other people might think of the work im doing when you do that i think the process is robbed of its freedom a little bit so i kind of found my way to an independent streak on this record i was making the songs for the songs themselves and for me alone i never played them for anyone else and i didnt obsess about them too much id write a song and move on so theres a truthful feeling to the album
1223696 when i make a record i finish it and i sit with it for a little while and inevitably ill write a couple more songs and its happened just about every time those other songs really shape the record and almost every time theyve had the title track of the record
1223697 to me its a rock record in the vein of people that ive always loved like weezer or the pixies but i guess those bands have great pop sensibilities but to me i view them as rock bands
1223698 if rock is popular at the time it becomes pop and i embrace pop music but it doesnt sound poppier to me so i just dont know if it is or it isnt ill take it if it is though because i think people enjoy that
1223699 hes a fine producer in his own right and id never worked with a producer who had written their own songs and had success with them
1223700 so i thought that that gave him a unique perspective on what i was doing and i thought he might work as a good sounding board for the songs ive got he taught me a lot because he has a great sense of melody
1223701 im writing about the journey i have been on and my life has taken me in some weird directions
1223702 some have been great some have been hard and i looked to those things and to the people that surround me and have drawn stories out of those experiences thats the one thing when you write about what you know as long as you keep living your life you dont run out of creative impetus
1223703 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1223704 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1223705 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1223706 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1223707 yo can i take it back to where it all started
1223708 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight

1223716 unfunny presidents only serve one term if they win an election at all
1223717 i may not be the last comic standing but im definitely the funniest candidate for president

1223740 i did not feel that i was given the material this season to warrant an emmy nomination and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization i withdrew my name from contention
1223741 in addition i did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials
1223742 if a tree falls in the woods but no one hears it did it make a sound
1223743 the future is lost economic social and technological impact of a cult phenomenon
1223744 everybody associated with it was really heartened by the enthusiasm from the fans and by the new fans to the show
1223745 whatever david chase wants to do is totally up to david wed be delighted
1223746 we have a deal for him to come back for another season he hasnt started shooting but yeah were counting on it

1223751 i will give you the information as you need it in the most entertaining fashion
1223752 how does it feel to be on what amounts to a television phenomenon
1223753 sort of validated and vindicated in the greater sort of world of television criticism and the culture is amazing and it makes you feel other people like good stuff too
1223754 do you feel an added pressure now that we all love the show so much
1223755 im one of those artists who can only hear bad things and im not encouraging anybody by the way
1223756 were going to have less commercials less promotional time and less reason for viewers to use the remote
1223757 were going to have more character more content more value
1223758 is a simple concept and potentially revolutionary were going to redefine the viewing experience
1223759 i would like to say how glad i am that the shows message of drinking and smoking and whoring has resonated with the tca
1223760 one of the reasons you see us announcing the end of the shield well in advance and announcing now that nip tuck is going to end in three years is were publicly challenging ourselves and saying were not going to wait until the light is blinking red
1223761 were going to plan for the orderly and dignified ending of great shows and were going to launch new great shows at the same time and were going to get the new shows on the air before the shows that have been the great shows as part of our brand are over
1223762 i feel very confident over time that were going to achieve that we decided were going to achieve it and were planning to achieve it
1223763 ultimately came to the decision about what the large interior structure of the shield would be narratively not just within episodes but across multiple seasons and to the notion that we would finish it after seven years
1223764 i think that decision was a big decision and a kind of fateful decision for fx and other channels that do serialized dramas
1223765 basically about catching the bad guys or solving diseases or whatever theyre about
1223766 i can say and i have said that its not true
1223767 first of all i think its actually died down considerably
1223768 i think sometimes we live in a bit of an echo chamber that probably the people in your room and obviously the people here are more fascinated by things along these lines than anyone else in the real world so its befuddling to me the amount of attention i have received
1223769 any time a candidate who has been questioned a lot about his stance on foreign policy his expertise on foreign policy any time he makes his first major foreign trip to the middle east i think is an enormous news event and i think that if we didnt cover it we wouldnt be doing our job
1223770 it was very deft on the part of the obama campaign i mean i have to be honest with you when john mccain went to four countries in the middle east in march i think that had he extended an invitation and offered time for each network to sit down and have extensive conversations and access to him during that trip thats something we would have strongly considered as well
1223771 i wanted to send a strong statement to the academy
1223772 for the past two years ive leaked these lists but it usually took me a couple of weeks this year i wanted to strong arm the academy into releasing the actors lists the week after they released the series lists i wanted to exert the maximum pressure showing they cant keep these lists secret its the internet age
1223773 this is not just an award this is the highest honor of the most powerful medium in the world arguably much more important than the oscars
1223774 the emmys saved hill street blues cheers all in the family they were all low rated in desperate need of support from the industry i think the emmy is not only the most important show business award but the most meaningful and the most noble and heroic
1223775 the emmys are finally acknowledging a trend this is where the creative genius of television is emerging and the fact that they are in the running is important
1223776 if we end up with only two of the five final nominees being cable at least we will have known that seven of the 10 were seriously considered and thats important
1223777 i cant even go to the platitude of its cyclical its going to come back
1223778 a lot of confidence has left the creative space on a day to day basis i see really talented people coming in very skittish not knowing what to pitch and what will sell i see executives trying to figure out where is that nerve to hit
1223779 were not going to take most of our comedy pitches in our office
1223780 were going to go out and meet the writers on their own turf and that could be a restaurant that could be if they want to do it in their house well do it in their house anything that gets it out of a sterile environment and try something different
1223781 go shoot something and then put it in the machine even if its not for air weve got to do anything to mix it up
1223782 the office in space petty jealousies and incompetencies on a long term mission to wherever theyre going
1223783 the series about black folk that abc was too scared to make
1223784 i cant tell you what the event is about but we want to make sure you have a ticket so you can cover it for the bilerico project we want bilerico project to be there for this one
1223785 it seems that some people have been having problems with our initial release so we have pwnagetool 2 0 1 for you it addresses the following issues it auto finds the bl39 and bl46 files better if theyre on your computer it creates the library itunes device support folder if not present which should help with some 1600 errors people have been having many people have reported the pwnagetool not starting up at all the icon never stops bouncing this issue should be resolved now the sparkle appcast url is fixed in this version so automatic updates should work for future releases because of the appcast url fix we recommend that everyone who downloaded pwnagetool 2 0 get this version if they want to stay up to date automatically
1223786 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1223787 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1223788 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate

1223791 its good for anthony to get out and get some reps and get going
1223792 hopefully he can get through the week and build on what he did today and be able to play on saturday he needs to play
1223793 when i had the latest surgery our goal was to get me back in time for the first game
1223794 im glad that it looks like were going to make that happen im looking forward to a good week of practice
1223795 itll be big for me just because i havent played in so long
1223796 to be able to get out there and get the feel for it all over again will be good for me i feel like once i get back into it and can stay in consistently then i can be at my best
1223797 as fast as weve been going here and the two days at the stadium with the simulated game situations i dont see it as very significant
1223798 he might but im excited where hes at hes played in a lot of games and hes come off of injuries before
1223799 obviously you get a little adrenaline and get fired up but theres no more testing it out to be done i am anxious just a little bit to get back out there being healthy the last couple games i played i wasnt feeling too good i think itll be good
1223800 youve got to think i played when it was a lot less stable its really like its brand new now as far as stability when youre healthy you dont play worried about that i honestly wont worry about it one bit
1223801 if i can match dan fouts in a matter of say three weeks in the preseason
1223802 im not going to cut it the whole preseason were going to see what happens
1223803 i was really pleased with the way our guys came out and practiced this morning
1223804 we had an upbeat fast moving practice obviously you could tell they had a day off yesterday i think some of the guys got a little more rest and our guys were flying around today
1223805 if you want to see lt get there for pregame warm ups
1223806 im looking forward to saturday just because were going to get a chance to get out there and play i say we im going to be out on the field and im going to be into it you get a chance to see where you really are
1223807 even though its the preseason you kind of start to feel like its a game week as we get closer and closer to saturday
1223808 any time we go out there youre playing to win a lot of us wont be in there late in the game but our team is out there our teammates that weve been working with and a lot of our young guys will be getting a lot of opportunities its exciting

1223811 i am deeply excited by the speech of nikita sergeyvich khrushchev and bring him my deep thankfulness for his extremely kind treatment to us and to myself personally for the high assessment of my humble work my phone call is explained by the following nikita sergeyvich had said that if our writers and artists become fixated on a gulag theme this will provide material for our enemies and to this material as on offal will fly great fat flies employing my acquaintance with you and recollecting our conversation on sparrow hills during the meeting of our leadership with the writers i ask you a kind word of advice i only ask that you not consider my request as an official query but as a comradely advice of a communist in whom i trust only nine years ago i wrote a play about camp life which is called alleyn i sholoskovka it does not repeat ivan denisovich and it has a different grouping of character types in it the prisoners do not stand against the gulag authorities but against the shameless prisoners from their own ranks my literary godfather alexander tvardovsky having read the play has not recommended that i give it to the theater but we have differed in our opinions and i have given it to the theaters chief director but now i am tortured by doubts considering this special attention and caution which has been expressed by nikita sergeyvich during his speech about employing materials from camp life in art and careful of my responsibilities in this regard i would like to consult with you whether i and my theater should work further on this play if you will say the same as tvardovsky i will immediately remove the play from the theater and work on it further it will be very painful for me if in any way i behave other than is expected from us by the party and by the very dear to me nikita sergeyvich note the writer solzhenitsyn asked of me if the opportunity arises to convey his most heartfelt greetings and well wishes to you khrushchev and wishes to assure you again that he fully understood your fatherly concern about the cultivation of our soviet literature and art and will attempt to prove worthy of the high calling of a soviet writer

1223919 he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
1223920 will be remembered as an intellectual who provided us with a testimony tinged with suffering and a sharp and accurate view on the tragedies of 20th century totalitarianism

1223953 peoples social circles do tend to shrink a little as they age that is mainly where that stereotype comes from but that image of the isolated elderly really falls apart when we broaden our definition of what social connection is

1223955 i like to go out and speak in schools about motivation

1223991 there are many freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the country but are yet to get their due recognition in the public sphere and books we shall try to portray their contribution audio visually through this endeavour
1223992 it will be a part of our campus and spread the message of communal harmony and patriotism
1223993 we have teams researching on introducing these laptops in regional languages like urdu hindi and bengali so that we can digitalise education using these low cost laptops for children in developing countries
1223994 the laptops have been localised and have come with devanagari script
1223995 initially these kids felt that education was not really important but now with laptop they feel like we have moved ahead and they want to compete and work with their urban counterparts
1223996 its not only in school where they use the laptop but also at home and even get their parents hooked on it
1223997 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1223998 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy is perfectly safe without adverse effects

1224000 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30

1224002 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behaviour and symptoms of anxiety and depression

1224004 sir alex is determined he will not let ronaldo go now if only on principle
1224005 but there are one or two people at united who are thinking whats the point of hanging on to him when real are ready to offer so much money and ronaldo will miss the start of the season in any case through injury
1224006 we have never implied that the players would receive 1 million

1224009 were at risk in this tournament and we need to manage that risk
1224010 based upon the time theyve spent discussing this i assume its going to be a larger issue in the next one
1224011 i have been involved in my own fair share of successful strike duos over the years so i know that liverpool have hit the jackpot this summer
1224012 in fernando torres and robbie keane liverpool have a strike force capable of bagging at least 40 goals between them enough to rival anything from chelsea manchester united or arsenal
1224013 keane has consistently scored 15 or 20 goals per season and following his 20million move from tottenham is now desperate to take that to the next level
1224014 torres oozes world class and should be worth at least 25 goals if not more
1224015 liverpool have always had a strong defence and with the likes of steven gerrard in midfield they are already a test for anyone
1224016 my greatest fear is that we do find this murderer and that greatest fear is that we find out because hes done somebody else

1224018 people who dont have anything to hide are usually easy to serve

1224025 theyve never had to sit on a bus when a pump didnt work and a second pump didnt work and a third didnt and he had to give himself a shot when were driving down a highway
1224026 everybody on our team is on full alert watching every move nick makes on that stage every single night of his life
1224027 support programs that motivate and inspire children to face adversity with confidence determination and a will to succeed
1224028 i admire the jonas brothers because their songs speak to people theyre not just normal songs they have a meaning each song has a different story behind it and that is true music

1224030 for the last year hispanics have been losing jobs at a faster rate than any other group
1224031 i am willing to do whatever kind of job they offer me
1224032 i did not think this would be this hard before it was easier to find a job
1224033 the problem is that the manufacturing industry above all the textile industry is disappearing now jobs available are more technical and hispanics need training to find those jobs
1224034 we know that 2006 was the peak in hispanic homeownership with 49 percent since then more and more hispanics are losing their homes

1224037 there is a person without a companion without even a son or brother and though there is no end to all his struggles his eyes are still not content with riches so who am i struggling for he asks and depriving myself from good this too is futile and a miserable task two are better than one because they have a good reward for their efforts for if either falls his companion can lift him up but pity the one who falls without another to lift him up also if two lie down together they can keep warm but how can one person alone keep warm and if somebody overpowers one person two can resist him a cord of three strands is not easily broken
1224038 god build warmth and intimacy into my life show me where and how to whole heartedly give myself to others for your purposes
1224039 out of any bad situations he would always make you laugh
1224040 you know the odds are against you but you want to believe
1224041 he would also have felt the same way we feel proud to see how the whole world the whole town everyone in the united states has supported him and remember him as the hero that he was
1224042 we have a long term relationship with the prospect capital team and appreciate their support of this growing portfolio company
1224043 palladiums private equity sponsorship was an important consideration for our investment
1224044 in addition we view the branded recurring revenue consumer products arena as a compelling sector for our capital
1224045 could we just teach them our good habits and not our bad
1224046 that just highlights how important it is to intervene early and set healthy lifestyle patterns early on
1224047 they are moving away to states where there is no discrimination
1224048 these are good people who are just trying to make a living
1224049 there are huge doubts about the credibility of the analysis
1224050 are people moving around because of shifting economic patterns and are some deciding to move home absolutely
1224051 its an issue that divides the country and neither of them wants that issue to come to the forefront because it divides their base
1224052 theres nothing were doing here that cant be done somewhere else in the world
1224053 as an immigrant playing soccer is like a dream come true
1224054 im not familiar with any of the latino soccer in other parts of the city but i do know its growing here as its growing everywhere
1224055 and we are trying to plan and prepare ourselves to have some better fields and facilities for soccer
1224056 theres such a limited number of fields available we are basically having to make use of what we have available
1224057 we have to do a better job provide first class facilities there are some good athletes out there they play very seriously they play their heart out
1224058 after many years of playing and being a referee for teams in dalton i decided to start a league here in chattanooga
1224059 because a lot of people would tell me there needed to be one
1224060 i had always enjoyed playing i even have a team that plays in dalton but since we are here in the united states i thought we should do everything we can to try to improve the sport
1224061 soccer is very important not only for hispanics we have players from russia jamaica from here chattanooga honduras brazil guatemala and mexico
1224062 its a fantastic sport and is one that will become more popular
1224063 its just the fact that in the south the traditional sports are baseball football and basketball those that you see on television and that get more of the news coverage have been the choice somewhat of southerners
1224064 its more tradition what you are brought up to know and understand and play
1224065 if you grow up with baseball you play baseball if you grow up with soccer you play soccer
1224066 im here every sunday even if its to see just one game
1224067 the plans of the diligent certainly lead to profit but anyone who is reckless only becomes poor
1224068 you will find there is money being spent that you dont know is being spent
1224069 statistics tell us that people will spend 33 percent more by using a credit card or debit card over cash
1224070 there is less of a connection when you swipe a credit card than when you pull cash from your wallet
1224071 if you are not currently paying cash for your cars consider making car payments to yourself now so that when the time comes for the next vehicle purchase you can write a check
1224072 you want to be the banker instead of letting mastercard or visa be your banker
1224073 i just kept renewing my policy because i had it automatically coming out of my checking account
1224074 i hate to get on the phone with an agent it takes more time because you have to drag out your policy and go over it but i was shocked at how much i ended up saving for the exact same coverage
1224075 you have to do two things look at past history and trust god
1224076 we can no longer afford to be passive about identity theft
1224077 if you really want to be vigilant and reduce your risk then sign up to receive all of your bank financial and credit card statements electronically
1224078 who are you to call me a sinner dont throw stones at me unless you are without sin
1224079 my sin is my personal business and does not hurt anybody else
1224080 if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and this we know the blood of jesus cleanses us from all our sin
1224081 if you will confess your sins the lord jesus is faithful and righteous to forgive us and to cleanse us for all unrighteousness
1224082 we fix our eyes on what is unseen because what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal
1224083 do not let the book of the law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it then you will be prosperous and successful
1224084 if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved for it is with your heart you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved
1224085 the god whom you have mocked will deliver you into my hands
1224086 fear you no longer will be my master i have a new lord in my life and he has not given me a spirit of fear but of power love and self control
1224087 if you just have a tiny bit of faith god can use your little faith to accomplish significant things
1224088 conviction of things not seen and the assurance of things hoped for
1224089 when you ask believe as though you have already received it
1224090 i prayed for a miracle i asked in jesus name i spoke to the mountains god did not answer prayer in 24 hours so i decided those promises are bogus
1224091 god if it is your will please remove this mountain
1224092 the church is looking for better methods god is looking for better men this vital urgent truth is one that this age of machinery is apt to forget the forgetting of it is as detrimental to the word of god as removing the sun from its sphere darkness confusion and death would ensue what the church needs is not better machinery not new organizations or more novel methods she needs men whom the holy spirit can use men of prayer men mighty in prayer the holy spirit does not come on machinery but on men he does not anoint plans but men men of prayer
1224093 lets be realistic the middle east has been a place or turmoil for thousands of years do you really think a genie covered in seaweed on the coast of scotland can grant that wish make another wish
1224094 now thats more like it take a practice swing so i will know what to improve
1224095 he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things
1224096 have you ever gotten that way in your own faith
1224097 come to me take my yoke and learn of me
1224098 come to me all who are heavy weary and heavy laden
1224099 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become a child of god
1224100 is anybody thirsty then let them come unto me is anybody hungry let him come and eat of the bread of life
1224101 come now let us reason together though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow though they be red as crimson they shall be as wool
1224102 i am the way the truth the life no one comes to the father expect through me
1224103 i can tell you how to get release and relief from all this
1224104 hey i heard jesus turned water into wine i wonder if he is going to tell us we need to drink wine what we can do is get wasted i mean its five oclock somewhere what we will do is drink all our problems away
1224105 jesus went to the wilderness to pray he is going to tell us to take a vacation
1224106 listen if you are overwhelmed because you are working too hard and your schedule is too busy then ive got more work for you to do
1224107 for this reason i labor and i strive according to his power working in me
1224108 i want you to do my work in my ministry with my power for my glory
1224109 i have heard you talking about going on the mission trip to mexico i cant do that right now because of my schedule i have too much to do
1224110 take my yoke i know where there is laughter i know where there is joy i know where there is living water for your soul but you must take my yoke
1224111 god here is my schedule you see how busy i am so if you are going to bless me then please do it at 2pm on tuesday
1224112 god you are the master you created me you know what needs to be done you know my gifts and my talents use me for your glory no conditions just use me
1224113 god is great god is good let us thank him
1224114 not that i have already obtained it or have become perfect but i press on to take hold that which christ has taken hold of me
1224115 hey dude you guys want to take a flight today
1224116 what i would find more morally dubious is my insisting to another that his or her reading or presuppositions because they are not pluralistic are somehow wrong the evangelical christian should be free to try to seek to convert me to christianity such an attempt is biblically warranted and consistent with evangelical exclusivist theology i remain free to say thank you but no thanks i would not want someone telling me that my cherished confessional traditions have only limited value i would not presume to do the same to another
1224117 hey emily someone actually linked your site to me after i made a post about lakhanis new book let me
1224118 hmmm i lied this beach is great on a walk now just had to ditch the public area duh
1224119 but there was one little episode while barack obama was overseas
1224120 the national enquirer caught former presidential candidate john edwards sneaking out of his girlfriends room at the 2 40 in the morning see edwards got caught cause the reporters were there waiting for him they were in the hotel waiting for him they knew he would be there see if edwards didnt want to get caught he should have met this woman at the hotel where john mccain was staying there are no reporters
1224121 you know they said on the news earlier tonight that this political campaign has only 100 days left only anybody complaining that this thing was dragging out oh not quick enough only 100 days left oh god 100 days i dont know whats less likely barack obama getting enough experience in 100 days or john mccain living another 100 days
1224122 you see where john mccain met with the dalai lama that was pretty amazing yeah the man millions believe goes back to the seventh century standing next to the dalai lama
1224123 barack obama is back from his big european tour did you see him in europe people were cheering him holding up signs blowing him kisses and that was just the american media covering the story
1224124 barack obama just back from his overseas trip thats what everyones talking about barack obamas upset did you hear about this hes angry cause the other day in israel someone revealed the contents of a private prayer that obama inserted into jerusalems western wall its supposed to be private and someone opened it up and revealed it yeah experts say its even worse than the time the washington post printed president bushs letter to santa
1224125 yesterday barack obama visited a doctor and he received treatment for a sore hip
1224126 during a recent concert british pop star george michael said that barack obama should pick hillary clinton as his vice president yeah george michael says hes been a huge hillary fan ever since she started copying his wham haircut
1224127 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed

1224154 think ill go out to alberta the weathers good there in the fall
1224155 despite the torrential rains throughout central mexico which kept a large number of people from getting to the voting booths especially in the shantytowns and the countryside where the roads are not paved despite our limited funds and despite the media barrage against us the first stage of the consulta nacional went ahead as planned and it was an overwhelming success
1224156 the successive mexican governments without consulting the people have proceeded to privatize countless government services and public enterprises this has caused untold harm to the people especially to the poor we cannot and we will not allow more poverty unemployment frustration violence and destruction of our country that is why we will not allow our oil resources to be privatized the will of the people must be heard it will be heard
1224157 differs on 10 points with the plan submitted on april 6 by calder n and the pan
1224158 she and the calder n government are open to finding common ground and a common reform plan with all the political parties in mexico that genuinely wish to modernize mexicos ailing energy system
1224159 great progress had been made to come up with an energy reform plan that unites the country
1224160 we must not further divide the country and provoke both internal and foreign confrontation
1224161 sufficient strength to impose its vision or its particular plan it will be necessary to compromise
1224162 now that the debates are over it is necessary for the congress to take action it is time for all of us to act responsibly
1224163 there will be no more congressional takeovers ortega stated referring to the 18 day takeover in april by dissident prd legislators of both houses of congress to prevent the fast track vote on calder ns energy package
1224164 we will not participate in any further acts of civil disobedience now it is time for a vote to be taken by the elected representatives of the mexican people
1224165 the beltrones pri so called alternative plan is a carbon copy of the pan proposals
1224166 the plan is unacceptable in any form the so called differences are of no significance it is an alternative that would do the same thing as the calder n plan that is turn our oil resources over to private mainly foreign interests
1224167 the pri the pan and the prd can have all the leadership meetings they want but the final decision will rest on the outcome of the referendum if they fail to respect the vote of the people as expressed through the three stages of the consulta nacional we will not sit back idly we are prepared we will mobilize nationwide we will not permit the politicians to privatize our oil and destroy our nation
1224168 we will not allow foreign masters to take over the destiny and resources of our country the only master here are the people if the pri and the pan go ahead and seek to impose a vote in the congress we will be ready we will call upon the mexican people to mobilize in mass protest actions there will be huge mobilizations across mexico there will be actions of peaceful civil resistance to prevent the privatization of pemex and our oil resources
1224169 on july 27 the no to privatization vote was overwhelming it was a vote of rejection of the privatization proposals presented by calder n but it was also a vote of rejection of beltrones of the pri
1224170 there are two camps here one the one hand there are those who defend the nation the majority of the workers and people on the other hand there are those who seek to turn our oil wealth over to the interests of the multinational corporations the pri pan green party televisa carlos slim and all those who would seek to reach a consensus with the oligarchs
1224171 the political situation calls for preparing a national march to mexico city to stop the takeover of our oil resources
1224172 this political situation also raises the following question what kind of political organization is needed to assist the working people of mexico to safeguard their interests
1224173 its kind of disappointing because we waited all day to hear it and all of a sudden you dont have it its real disappointing
1224174 im starting to feel a lot like my future fiancee making her wait for a while i dont think she likes it and i dont really like it either
1224175 its going to get old after a while i think its getting old to a lot of people and im anxious to see the outcome
1224176 if weve got to wait another day well wait another day and see what happens
1224177 the thing that comes to mind were all going to have to really bottle our road rage big time because people are going to be really frustrated for a long long time every day
1224178 it will be rough for the first few days and i think after that people will get use to it

1224185 if i win i am american not a black american but if i did something bad then they would say i am a negro we are black and we are proud of being black black america will understand what we did tonight
1224186 a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the olympic spirit
1224187 i evaluated researched and studied my moves in terms of why i thought it was necessary for me to make a statement in mexico city
1224188 all i can say is any athlete from whatever part of the world they have to do the same they have to evaluate they have to study and then they have to go into their moral fabric and make their decision as to whether theyre concerned about medals or whether theyre concerned about humanity
1224189 at every olympics there is one athlete who ends up inspiring the world with their courage and character were hoping that athlete is reading this
1224190 olympic athletes have the platform and the power to inspire the world
1224191 at the beijing games we believe athletes have the opportunity to inspire not only with their athletic performances but also by standing up for what is right by supporting human rights and freedom for tibet
1224192 reasons of state raison detat forbids me to express myself in detail on that subject
1224193 i have to be careful about what i do and what i say i am at the head of an organization my duty is to make the olympics a success and let the athletes express themselves freely i am criticized and i answer that i am ready to take blows in order to protect the athletes
1224194 in view of my responsibilities i have lost some of my freedom of speech
1224195 negative publicity regarding china and tibet as well as the environmental issue and discussion on beijings air pollution did its job
1224196 shows the importance of the reputation and political situation of the host country
1224197 as an athlete who has been to two olympics i think i can say that its not the olympics that are causing this problem but it is the olympics that can be part of this resolution
1224198 on the whole the olympics provide a lot of good
1224199 personally id love to see more athletes involved in causes they believe in
1224200 you may not believe in the causes i believe in but believe in something
1224201 no kind of demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites venues or other areas
1224202 being an olympian was always a dream of mine as a kid thats what this year is about
1224203 unquestionably in 2002 if you would have asked me if i wouldve done what im doing now i wouldve looked at you like you had three heads
1224204 i wish more people would become involved but im not necessarily critical of people who dont there are different pressures out there and that is your priority
1224205 as an athlete i feel like i have some visibility
1224206 im a passionate person and when i talk about darfur i feel like theres nothing controversial im talking about humanity to me this is why i truly love it the olympics has been a positive political platform
1224207 i really want to go to beijing and make a difference
1224208 i came into college at 17 and not having a clue
1224209 i began to feel so insignificant and i wanted to change that
1224210 nobodys ever tried to quiet me but ive had many many hints
1224211 the hardest thing for my coaches is my influence on my teammates right around the time of chicago people were getting nervous
1224212 my own agent said you get involved in this stuff and sponsors might not want to sign you
1224213 this is the world youre dealing with and theyre not going to want to touch you with a 10 foot pole
1224214 im not concerned with medals medals will tarnish but humanity will go on
1224215 they didnt particularly like that i was a black man stepping up to the plate saying i was concerned with humanity my whole thing is that in order for healing to come about you have to recognize whats happening in order to make tomorrow better than yesterday

1224318 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
1224319 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you

1224337 he has got some very important attributes that you need in a captain
1224338 he can clearly lead by example by being a fantastic player
1224339 he is a very confident person and he is pretty decisive as well when tough decisions are there to be made he is going to make those decisions

1224356 i thought that he certainly looked more confident in the three innings after that
1224357 again i think we talked about it when he came back off the disabled list in early july its still a work in progress and we acknowledge that but i do like the way he went back out and handled himself and stayed out to pitch because thats the kid we think can really compete in this league
1224358 ive said it a lot now when i need to make a pitch get a ground ball it feels like its an inch away i dont have a really good explanation for the way it is
1224359 i feel like i might start pressing a bit and make a pitch better than i need to but at the same time im just not catching any breaks at all and the great players that play this game they make their breaks and thats a real challenge for me now to make a break it feels like when i do make a pitch its just not out of reach of somebody

1224465 they are healthier and break down in the body more easily
1224466 our message is that people should cut down on both
1224467 we have been very concerned about the misunderstanding of our product in the marketplace and want to provide the facts so that consumers can make their choices based on science rather than urban myth hfcs and sugar are treated by the body the same they contain the same calories and nutritionally are no different
1224468 it has a crisper flavor not as cloying i think it is a better flavored drink
1224469 theres just a lot more awareness about high fructose corn syrup among the public and once people taste a soda flavored with cane sugar they like it better
1224470 im aware that edibles would be healthier and probably taste more natural without the addition of corn syrup or that high fructose junk
1224471 our study shows for the first time the surprising speed with which humans make body fat from fructose
1224472 fructose glucose and sucrose can be made into triglycerides a form of body fat however once you start the process of fat synthesis from fructose its hard to slow it down
1224473 there are lots of people out there who want to demonize fructose as the cause of the obesity epidemic
1224474 i think it may be a contributor but its not the only problem americans are eating too many calories for their activity level were overeating fat were overeating protein and were over eating all sugars
1224475 the message from this study is powerful because body fat synthesis was measured immediately after the sweet drinks were consumed
1224476 the carbohydrates came into the body as sugars the liver took the molecules apart like tinker toys and put them back together to build fats
1224477 this is an underestimate of the effect of fructose because these individuals consumed the drinks while fasting and because the subjects were healthy lean and could presumably process the fructose pretty quickly fat synthesis from sugars may be worse in people who are overweight or obese because this process may be already revved up
1224478 its a less controlled movement of fructose through these pathways that causes it to contribute to greater triglyceride synthesis
1224479 the bottom line of this study is that fructose very quickly gets made into fat in the body
1224480 we cannot definitively state that fructose is driving the obesity epidemic
1224481 but we can say that there is evidence supporting the possibility that it could have a contributory role if not a major role
1224482 its the old shoe phone relayed to the cell phone so you would trace the call back to dc then id appear on the roof top right next to you trick
1224483 never bet on the end of the world because its only going to happen once you

1224503 paavo nurmi is not going to run in the olympics
1224504 america is the most obese country on earth and yet there are at least 35 5 million families going hungry every year this is the richest country on earth it produces the most food and yet there are people here that go hungry that for me is a telling contradiction of the food system and thats why i turn to the united states a lot because it shows what can happen when markets go wild but its also the case for what happens when people get together and organize there are some really inspiring things happening in the united states people are fighting back and thats why i live here because it is possible to fight back in some really creative ways
1224505 local government spaces in which people can democratically demand of their local government for example that food come from within 100 200 miles of where ever your municipality is and demanding that there be space for farmers markets and demanding that there be space for victory gardens and demanding that there be adequate support for low income people to be able to eat

1224509 when they ask me that i ask them if they would consider operating a business without a telephone
1224510 there is an entire generation of people that will never pick up the yellow pages
1224511 when i sit at my desk to make plans for lunch i use instant messaging with my friends about where to go and i need to be able to go online to pick a restaurants menu and link my friends to that
1224512 in my opinion a web site is part of the marketing mix today if not one of the most important parts
1224513 im amazed when i hear someone doesnt have a web site
1224514 i cant imagine running a business without a web site in this day and age
1224515 a womans dress shop can use the web site to track a customers preferred brands colors and styles based on purchases and when they prefer to shop
1224516 you can direct target customers where its in their interest and not spam
1224517 a web site can educate potential customers as to what you do and its a service for current customers who do business with you
1224518 getting a site up and running is no longer an ordeal
1224519 my recommendation based on your level of sophistication is start off small and get your feet wet and you can get more later
1224520 you can find an independent developer who will do everything and they will sell it to you for 500 but a lot of those clients come back to us after a year
1224521 the only value with a free service is to use it as a way to draft and think through setting up their site
1224522 the biggest problem we have is that clients want a web site and dont know why
1224523 dont do it just to have one you have to have a goal of more sales more calls or more traffic
1224524 you cant figure out success unless you have goals and goals will drive what you want the web site to be
1224525 what role is it going to fill how will it fill it and how will you invest in it
1224526 what we think the users want and what they really want may be two very different things
1224527 we built our own programs and tools to help people update their web sites
1224528 if it doesnt work and you dont know how to use it its kind of useless and its done for people who dont know how to use computers
1224529 what is important is keeping the e mail from the service that the domain is registered with
1224530 thats how they will contact you and notify you and that has all the file info on getting it set up in the first place
1224531 years ago you put your site up on the web and put in a keyword and registered with lots of search engines and youd have a top ranking but now there are millions of web sites being introduced every day
1224532 everyone is competing for the top page rank most engines especially google are smart and they can determine a new ploy to drive traffic and they stop that
1224533 as a web site gets out there and has relevant content and its easy to navigate the search engines pick up on it and start ranking it
1224534 a lot of small businesses are realizing that a lot of their potential market share is going to larger businesses because they have embraced the internet
1224535 if you have a product or service and want people to learn about it this is a great way to do it
1224536 you cant make near as many cold calls in a day as you can having an effective web site
1224537 eu sou como papel higi nico se n o t num rolo t na merda
1224538 we just want them to know theres other options and people do care about them and we can help them make a difference in their lives
1224539 it takes the courage and strength of a warrior to ask for help
1224540 we try to get them callers to talk about their situation and what they remember and see if they can identify exactly what their issues are i think theres a comfort in knowing that they can get some help from people who do understand what combat stress is like
1224541 they have indicated to us that they are in extreme danger either they have guns in their hand or theyre standing on a bridge or theyve already swallowed pills
1224542 see to them youre nothing but a freak like me
1224543 this is the kind of event that attracts a group that wants to appreciate music
1224544 if i know hes playing at caff mela in wenatchee you can bet im going to go see him

1224557 we have made some concessions including agreeing to postpone the elections and we have shown flexibility on this
1224558 we want to see the final version of the u n proposal we want to make sure that there is no reference to the referendum in it
1224559 have not shown any flexibility and they are not interested in reaching any deals

1224563 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened

1224565 it is attention that has significance for the war on terror

1224569 ensuring the welfare and safety of those in our custody is one of our top priorities
1224570 they never gave her any of the proper medications for her aids diagnosis they did give her a prescription for a urinary tract infection but even then they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1224571 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain

1224580 couldnt you cheat or at least be biased because you already know what happened in the past
1224581 but all that historical data just sitting there waiting to be analyzed is tempting isnt it maybe there are profound secrets in that data just waiting for geeks like us to discover it would it be so wrong for us to examine that historical data first to analyze it and see if we can find patterns hidden within it
1224582 if the hypothesis is true scott will be able to flip 10 heads in a row
1224583 aha but can he flip ten heads in a row again
1224584 i have the truth and it feels right in my spirit
1224585 what that is basically a healing walk for anybody when they come to the conference
1224586 the ribbons will be all set up by the aug 14 conference
1224587 in the fall semester of last year i realized just how i really didnt know much about the issue
1224588 being in that class we had every monday i called it my weeping mondays because i would go home and a lot of people said the same thing we would go home and just cry
1224589 my house is draped in pink fabric right now and i died my hair pink
1224590 its about bringing the conference to the people who may not be able to attend but understand everything were doing for it
1224591 this issue is huge and some people just dont know about it yet and they need to
1224592 its really important for all women all around the world and families and men and children
1224593 but that is just a demonstration of exactly what is happening to these women they are basically being graffitied upon no one cares about them so taking violence to these trees thats the problem
1224594 it just shows exactly what is going on in the real world
1224595 the only involvement i have had so far praying sharing has come after they asked me
1224596 what a joy to see them using and exercising those gifts god has given them even at this early stage
1224597 we need to do this then we will have eternal life

1224615 i love to watch relaxing its entertaining theres so much good stuff on there and what with my dvr im responsible with it i save time in fact
1224616 in the next few months or so when im done nursing and tophers done with his dissertation
1224617 we will be reading several memoirs by teachers to see how their personal lives change and are changed by the classroom
1224618 that teaching and the byproducts thereof are thus within the scope of employment and this additional control by the employer institution transform syllabi into work for hire
1224619 increasingly faculty members intellectual products including those generated from their basic research and teaching activities are being considered as commodities
1224620 though i have to say no one in my doctoral program ever explicitly said not to steal someones entire syllabus
1224621 i guess our syllabi are sometimes available online that must make them public property
1224622 the most insidious aspect of plagiarism is how much damage it does to the surrounding terrain
1224623 ah man i dont want to come back to reality
1224624 is our society changing or is it our awareness making it look worse
1224625 no est muerto quien puede yacer eternamente y con el paso de los a os la misma muerte puede morir
1224626 it takes a long time to change peoples perception about sports but weve come full circle and now the forest service and mountain seem pretty fired up about the trail
1224627 im from canada and have worked on a number of trails in that area
1224628 i knew the quality of trails that could be done and wanted to see something like that happen here
1224629 just look at the place i get to work its beautiful up here
1224630 i think is should be used as a stepping stone for more trails
1224631 i think this trail is every bit as good as anything at fernie and if it went in at a place like whistler i think people would be super stoked on it
1224632 theres a young man behind me who is behaving strangely he keeps cursing my children are beginning to get scared cups hand over phone i think he may be intoxicated
1224633 well get a security officer right over maam where are you sitting
1224634 hes in his early twenties he has shaggy hair a dirty ball cap and hes dressed as a highlighter
1224635 were monitoring the safety of the hpv vaccine very carefully and the only adverse event that causes some concern is fainting after the vaccine
1224636 higher rates of guillain barr have been associated with the swine flu vaccine and possibly with the meningitis vaccine menactra but it is no more common in those who get gardasil than in those who dont
1224637 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children
1224638 it takes a long time to change peoples perception about sports but weve come full circle and now the forest service and mountain seem pretty fired up about the trail
1224639 im from canada and have worked on a number of trails in that area
1224640 i knew the quality of trails that could be done and wanted to see something like that happen here
1224641 just look at the place i get to work its beautiful up here
1224642 i think is should be used as a stepping stone for more trails
1224643 i think this trail is every bit as good as anything at fernie and if it went in at a place like whistler i think people would be super stoked on it
1224644 i wanna die hold tight if i love ya cause it might not last long
1224645 this is brutally beautiful so are we this is endless so are we we can heal this
1224646 boy go find your spine and ride it out of here
1224647 p s see me for who i am weve got work to do
1224648 god clearly tells us that we must protect life at all costs to not do so is committing a serious sin against god
1224649 a is for abstinences many of you cannot live by this advice let us be realistic few if any of you can abstain which brings us to b be faithful some of you are faithful many of you are not so that leaves us with c condoms now many of you believe that condoms are a crime against god that wasted semen is a sin and i am here today to tell you otherwise
1224650 you see if you are hiv positive and you have unprotected sex and you infect someone you have in the eyes of god committed murder or if you are hiv negative and you have unprotected sex with someone who is infected and they infect you you have in the eyes of god committed suicide
1224651 so my children wearing a condom is not a sin not wearing one is
1224652 we have so much oil production coming on line and there are no routes to ship it out
1224653 alpas communications are essentially a guide describing how to use sick leave inappropriately
1224654 people have opened their eyes to the fact that the world is a riskier place
1224655 what difference does it make if you pay your loan on time
1224656 we are in the process of making sure that what we end up with conforms with our underwriting culture
1224657 farming has the potential to go through the greatest upheaval since the green revolution bringing harvests that are more healthful sustainable and yes even more flavorful the change is being pushed along by market forces that influence how our farmers farm
1224658 and then when i get back to france it is like going into a museum where nothing ever changes in some ways it is a comfort because life here is nice predictable and comfortable but it is like the land of the dead
1224659 everyone says mark warner is a shoe in for the senate seat
1224660 the grim reality is that trillions of dollars were borrowed and spent that will never be repaid no government program can alter that fact someone is going to have to pay the piper for all those granite counter tops and plasma tvs the price tag is staggering and for all the bailouts and stimulus packages all the government can do is exacerbate the losses and shift the burden through inflation nor can the government resurrect bubble home prices and the fantasy of real estate riches that went along with them one way or another rational home prices will be restored and the myths of our asset based consumption dependent economy will be finally discredited
1224661 decision to write off 90 per cent of its us conduit loans
1224662 a us recession is now locked in but more alarmingly 55 per cent loan losses point to the possibility of a depression
1224663 not only is something wrong with the dollar the banking system and the economy there almost literally is nothing right with any of them truth is that whistling noise you hear is the air streaming past your ears as we all plummet into the deepest economic abyss ever seen by mankind
1224664 what do our officials most fear they fear the publics loss of confidence events are driving their improvised attempts to stem a general loss of confidence in the dollar in them the financial and monetary system and the government as a whole
1224665 this card game recreates an old fashioned spaghetti western shoot out with each player randomly receiving a character card to determine special abilities and a secret role card to determine their goal
1224666 the reason this is such a good place for diving is that the crescent shape of the volcano protects the wildlife from strong currents
1224667 molesta lo que inventan si no saben lo que es entonces escriben cualquier cosa uno ya est tranquilo en ese tema pero me incomoda lo que se ha dicho lo de la indisciplina lo m o es un tema privado que ya se est resolviendo en mi mente existe la u y nada m s no pienso en otro equipo ojal que las cosas mejoren
1224668 los anuncios pomposos sin convicci n se convierten en un desastre
1224669 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1224670 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1224671 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1224672 we lost tonight thats the worst thing that happened the other stuffs forgotten its not surprising when were all competing were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen everybody gets to see it oh well
1224673 when you lose a guy whos been here awhile its always a shock maybe well start rolling now
1224674 theres no doubt our starting pitchers have to do a better job
1224675 thats the only way i see this ballclub going in the right direction if the starting pitching doesnt go in the right direction than were going to have a little problem
1224676 its going to be a big push for us to have contreras back in the rotation because we need that
1224677 were going to have jose back and those 15 days will help him i have a great feeling this kid is going to be good for two months we need that and we can make a different move in the bullpen
1224678 the minor league kids weve had coming up theyre doing a good job
1224679 they saved our bullpen for a little while but i dont need a body im looking for guys i can use
1224680 if by chance thats not going to work as far as number of games played or not wanting to be here then we have to look at that
1224681 were going to do whats best for our team period if its keeping khabibulin well do that if its not then we move on and we try to do something that makes sense for both of us right now were sitting right where we need to be weve got lots of time to make the right moves if we do
1224682 i would think the first day after the signing he khabibulin was probably taken aback by it and rightfully so
1224683 we look at our injury status the last few years and you can never be sure if guys are going to finish the season or play a whole season
1224684 we want to make sure were covered that we have an opportunity to ice the best team every night and have the best goaltending every night winning is the bottom line
1224685 definitely were going to push each other to play and compete and its going to benefit the team i look at it as a good thing
1224686 id like to play as much as i can but ill have to play well and earn my ice time theres going to be competition and its always like than on any nhl team this year its going to be a little more than the average team but were going to work together and make it happen so we can have some wins
1224687 we told him hes going to battle for a spot
1224688 the competition will raise their level and make us a better team its all about winning its not about keeping people happy
1224689 and sometimes perception is reality if you dont like it you change it
1224690 the guys know when they get the opportunity theyve got to get in there and get the job done
1224691 weve got in my opinion four five six guys who have the ability to play
1224692 but the guys who are going to be out there theyre all going to have to play again thats a good thing you shouldnt have a guy who goes out there and has to play 70 plays a game that should be split keep guys fresh keep guys ready thats probably what well do
1224693 right now were just out there practicing trying to get a feel for one another and get a little chemistry going in this offense once we get later into preseason games and the regular season ill figure out what my role is

1224703 bobolinks called skunk blackbirds in some places were once a common sight in the eastern united states in mating season the male in his handsome tuxedo like suit sings deliriously as he whirrs madly over the hayfields bobolink numbers have plummeted almost 50 percent in the last four decades according to the north american breeding bird survey the birds are being poisoned on their wintering grounds by highly toxic pesticides rosalind renfrew a biologist at the vermont center for ecostudies captured bobolinks feeding in rice fields in bolivia and took samples of their blood to test for pesticide exposure she found that about half of the birds had drastically reduced levels of cholinesterase an enzyme that affects brain and nerve cells a sign of exposure to toxic chemicals since the 1980s pesticide use has increased fivefold in latin america as countries have expanded their production of nontraditional crops to fuel the demand for fresh produce during winter in north america and europe rice farmers in the region use monocrotophos methamidophos and carbofuran all agricultural chemicals that are rated class i toxins by the world health organization are highly toxic to birds and are either restricted or banned in the united states in countries like guatemala honduras and ecuador researchers have found that farmers spray their crops heavily and repeatedly with a chemical cocktail of dangerous pesticides in the mid 1990s american biologists used satellite tracking to follow swainsons hawks to their wintering grounds in argentina where thousands of them were found dead from monocrotophos poisoning migratory songbirds like bobolinks barn swallows and eastern kingbirds are suffering mysterious population declines and pesticides may well be to blame a single application of a highly toxic pesticide to a field can kill seven to 25 songbirds per acre about half the birds that researchers capture after such spraying are found to suffer from severely depressed neurological function migratory birds modern day canaries in the coal mine reveal an environmental problem hidden to consumers testing by the united states food and drug administration shows that fruits and vegetables imported from latin america are three times as likely to violate environmental protection agency standards for pesticide residues as the same foods grown in the united states some but not all pesticide residues can be removed by washing or peeling produce but tests by the centers for disease control show that most americans carry traces of pesticides in their blood american consumers can discourage this poisoning by avoiding foods that are bad for the environment bad for farmers in latin america and in the worst cases bad for their own families
1224704 we were very pessimistic that this was going to happen so were delighted
1224705 we were very upset when the appeals court ordered a new trial and felt that they the judges who ruled really did not represent the views of the full appeals court
1224706 this will be something that will come back to uplift our retirees
1224707 hopefully well get support for the original conviction i think the worst thing in the world would be that theres a retrial that just takes years
1224708 theres a growing sense that what we saw out of merrill lynch is the beginning of the end for the financial cleanup
1224709 theyre focused on those issues but how it plays out is they have the authority to reverse the conviction or affirm it
1224710 neither the panels original ruling nor todays decision was a surprise to me
1224711 the trial court excluded evidence that would have established mr nacchios innocence
1224712 the panel concluded that the trial was unfair and we expect the en banc court to agree

1224718 according to a 2002 harris poll 70 percent of adults in the united states take vitamins minerals herbs or other supplements
1224719 consumers dont realize that theres a big difference between dietary supplements homeopathic remedies and over the counter medications
1224720 theyre all sold side by side in stores yet theres a vast difference in the evidence for safety and effectiveness that manufacturers must have to sell them
1224721 how would you eat if you were at a royal banquet dinner

1224724 it is a combination of music and spokespersons as well as an exhibit of actual solar technology
1224725 it is to raise awareness and educate elected officials on the benefits of wind energy
1224726 we are hosting this event and a couple of others to take advantage of the opportunity to build relationships
1224727 its just a natural thing for a broad based investment company that has roots in energy to be invested in alternative sources of clean energy
1224728 these projects were in play before we saw anything publicly from pickens
1224729 the thinking is that oil prices are heading lower and thats obviously a positive for the market

1224732 his long years of successful leadership of global telecom powerhouses will serve adva optical networking well krishs insight and experience will provide us with continued vision to build market leadership and to have further impact on the north american marketplace
1224733 having watched adva optical networking in the past ive been impressed by its product innovation and successful work with global customers the recent additions to the management team indicate the companys commitment to excellence and its desire to have top notch leadership at the helm i am excited to drive further growth and to take part in the continued success of the company

1224745 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
1224746 speculators buy up large amounts of oil and then sell it to each other again and again
1224747 a barrel of oil may trade 20 plus times before it is delivered and used the price goes up with each trade and consumers pick up the final tab
1224748 i think the securities and exchange commission should investigate it
1224749 if someone knowingly starts a rumor or passes on a rumor they should go to jail
1224750 there have long been clear rules in place that prohibit market manipulation by knowingly spreading false rumors
1224751 we have a good deal of comfort about the capital cushions that these firms including bear stearns have been on
1224752 when a member of the united states senate makes such a statement it frightens depositors
1224753 if there is anyone who knows who is next it would be the folks at the federal deposit insurance corp
1224754 they however keep what they know to themselves for good reason

1224762 we look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets

1224765 first and foremost my biggest concern has been and will be for the hardworking semgroup family of employees who were the reason for semgroups unprecedented growth and success
1224766 secondly my family remains committed to the tulsa community i am a strong proponent of both personal and corporate giving
1224767 obviously current financial pressures will continue to affect our perspective on leasing
1224768 that said while we obviously cant make guarantees we are in the market today with competitive programs to make gmac leasing more affordable and plan on continuing to offer this financing alternative as part of our august incentive play on 08 and 09 models with some adjustments and exceptions
1224769 we dont see any scenario of prices going down and staying down
1224770 its unacceptable for the government to fold its arms when people are living in such appalling conditions without running water and other basic facilities
1224771 those refugees killed when they went back into the communities were not killed by community members but by criminals
1224772 if people refuse to be reintegrated we cant evict them and close the camps but we believe reintegration will work
1224773 i went back because these mediators came from premier ebrahim rasools office and told us that the communities are now safe because theyve spoken to the people but i will be killed here if i dont pay these people
1224774 they ordered some quarts and ate and drank i had to pay the bill and then they said im welcome
1224775 they said i must be kind and nice to them and then i can stay otherwise you must fuck off kwerekwere foreigner they said i pay about r250 every weekend for my safety

1224777 the commencement of this global phase 2b study represents an important milestone in the clinical development of our vacc 4x therapeutic peptide candidate
1224778 in previous clinical studies this peptide therapeutic candidate has demonstrated promising results in t cell stimulation of the immune system in hiv patients bionor is excited to provide a potential significant step forward for treatment alternatives in the management of hiv disease
1224779 a successful immunotherapeutic hiv vaccine would give patients and doctors enormous advantages over current treatments both in developed and developing countries even if this vaccine is not the final answer it could help the march towards a successful immunotherapeutic hiv vaccine
1224780 this is the largest current therapeutic vaccine trial in the world involving 345 patients this trial will establish a solid foundation for hiv immune therapies if we can maintain immunogenicity during drug free periods
1224781 oncologists are in need of better tools to help identify children at a high risk of developing cancer
1224782 our use of new high resolution techniques allowed us to discover that these genetic changes which we had always thought only existed in tumours can also be found in the patients blood
1224783 we believe that these cnvs can act as the basis for how structural alterations occur in the tumour genome
1224784 in this paper we propose a model for how cnvs contribute to both inherited and sporadic cancers
1224785 we anticipate that early screening will allow us to identify patients with the highest risk so that cancers can be identified and treated at an earlier stage furthermore since the findings speak to our fundamental understanding of the genetic basis of cancer this may lead to advances in personalized medicine for our patient population
1224786 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1224787 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1224788 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1224789 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
1224790 one of the challenges of caring for patients with li fraumeni syndrome is that it is difficult to predict when a cancer may develop
1224791 these findings suggest that screening for cnvs in families predisposed to cancer may help identify those who are at highest risk and help us to detect any cancer early
1224792 early detection is critical because we know that most cancers can be treated if they are caught early enough this is important research that is bringing us closer to answers and options for people with li fraumeni syndrome
1224793 as a cancer survivor and mother of two kids who will likely face a cancer diagnosis in the near future im happy that ive equipped myself through genetic testing and screening with the best possible tools to deal with all possible outcomes
1224794 whatever road lfs takes me down i still celebrate that ill never have to lie awake at night and ask myself those questions as a parent im doing whatever i can to prevent my kids from being victimized by this disease the questions you ask the answers you seek give me and others like me hope hope that the legacy of loss will in the very near future end

1224798 a major change from the previous defence of business as usual based on our developing country status
1224799 to date we have been discussing whether we really should make pudding we now have the basics of a recipe though not the actual amounts or cooking times these should come through the policy and legislation that government has committed to adopt in 2010 as well as through international commitments to be finalised in copenhagen in december 2009 in the post 2012 new global deal on climate change
1224800 the long term mitigation scenario will simply remain rhetoric unless real resources are directed to energy efficiency and renewable energy neither of which has been given the necessary attention or government budgets in the past
1224801 if government set a feed in tariff of about 70 c kwh for wind energy and 80c kwh for solar thermal energy this would create the market for private renewable energy generators to come in and provide energy to our already overstrained grid
1224802 the cost that it takes to run them would make almost all renewable energies competitive
1224803 a total of r4 billion has already been wasted on the pebble bed modular reactor with nothing to show for it after 10 years of research one can only dream about how far ahead we would be if we had invested that money in solar energy research and development

1224813 el jueves nosotros tenemos un primer borrador que entregaremos a los gobernadores quienes asistir n a la ciudad de m xico en una cena privada que tendremos para entregarles un primer documento el consejo nacional se realizar el 16 y 17 y un punto fundamental en ese consejo ser la presentaci n de nuestra propuesta que para entonces ya tiene que estar terminada
1224814 creo que debe ser antes del 15 de agosto es lo que creo le vine a plantear que tengamos una reuni n los gobernadores con l que nos den una copia del borrador del proyecto
1224815 les aseguro que ser un poco antes de esas tres semanas aspiramos a un dictamen unitario que no a una iniciativa conjunta como se ha dicho pero si un dictamen que una y que resuelva
1224816 no tenemos ninguna objeci n que en la reuni n que sostendremos el pr ximo mi rcoles que ser a las nueve de la noche en el senado de la rep blica donde acudiremos de nuestra parte con los coordinadores parlamentarios y que el pri y el pan tambi n acudir n con legisladores que ellos mismos designar n podamos proponer al pri y al pan que ampliemos la mesa a los dem s partidos pol ticos

1224819 said mike cox a real estate consultant with re max professionals inc in highlands ranch
1224820 it probably has to do with the fact that we went a few months without being hammered in the national news about foreclosures
1224821 people started thinking about gas prices a little more and less about foreclosures
1224822 i think its possible the numbers will go down before they start going up again

1224831 what happens to the people who are falling off the ledge right now the answer is theyre going to keep falling
1224832 the agencies support the policy objective of deterring cartel activity in the south african economy especially in cases where such cartel activities cause harm to the poorest of the poor
1224833 however we are of the view that the proposed provisions will lead to some unintended consequences and may in fact have the effect of weakening rather than strengthening the agencies
1224834 the act should be amended to permit an administrative penalty based upon the number of years for which the anti competitive conduct has been practised
1224835 we also propose the introduction of a general offence for obstruction of justice which would include interfering with witnesses or destroying documentary and electronic evidence
1224836 we must stress that in our view this provision is not capable of implementation
1224837 our proposal to address this concern is to increase the powers of the competition commission to investigate these markets in order to explore in depth whether or not there is indeed underlying anti competitive conduct which it would then use its prosecutorial powers to remedy
1224838 everybody at the office agrees its kind of a wierd operating system

1224885 scrap is an important and cheap source of input which can reduce the cost of beneficiation this is really low hanging fruit you cannot impose a ban on exports but there needs to be a balance
1224886 essentially there is a global shortage of scrap quite a number of countries such as china and india have already introduced some measures to restrict exports

1224907 he is despised and rejected by man a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we did not esteem him surely he has born our griefs and carried our sorrows
1224908 sorrow is better than laughter for by a sad countenance the heart is made better

1224929 john is just passionate about helping people in countries that are not as fortunate as we are in the united states
1224930 if you were a child of john youd have to be
1224931 at such a young age he showed great maturity and enthusiasm to whatever he did
1224932 he was very personable he had a very endearing self view
1224933 even with his family background he was such a humble guy
1224934 you wouldnt even know that he was a coors unless he introduced himself as jonathan coors
1224935 we had an extensive discussion about his experience with the schwarzenegger administration and that told me a lot
1224936 he explained his frustration with schwarzenegger abandoning principle and being a pragmatic sort of everyday politician
1224937 smart business minds across the state are against 47 and it makes no sense why jonathan coors would risk the hard earned wages and benefits of millions of colorados workers
1224938 jonathan coors is not affiliated with our business and his views do not reflect our position
1224939 he coors speaks his principle regardless of the resistance and the pressure in the opposition

1224950 the ftcs case is weak and seems a relic of a bygone era when antitrust law was divorced from basic economic principles
1224951 as we are all aware the availability of affordable mortgage financing is essential to turning the corner on the current housing correction
1224952 we are at the early stages of what should be a promising path where the nascent u s covered bond market can grow and provide a new source of mortgage financing
1224953 we look forward to being leading issuers as the u s covered bond market develops

1224965 advances in technology have made it possible to conduct oil exploration that is out of sight protects coral reefs and habitats and protects against oil spills
1224966 the technology of the drilling industry may have improved but offshore drilling is a dirty business and it still leads to oil spills due to failed equipment aberrant weather or human error on a frequent basis
1224967 firstbank fits a bit of a niche that few other banks do
1224968 once i know what my fixed term is my project either works or it doesnt based on that interest rate if you are in a variable rate loan it could go up or down
1224969 the credit crunch has dried up sources for these types of loans and given us an opportunity
1224970 they operate with an extremely conservative philosophy and they dont make giant moves quickly without testing the water first
1224971 theyre loaning their own capital so the decisions and execution are closely linked and they have an entrepreneurial spirit
1224972 the loan is structured in a way that allows us to grow the facility and borrow more as long as we continue to invest alongside them
1224973 the underlying picture is one of a labor market that is weak
1224974 the economy is growing slowly so you tend to see job losses rising the weakness could increase further in coming months
1224975 one of the reasons for having hybrids is to reduce dependence on foreign oil
1224976 you dont want to substitute dependence on foreign oil with dependence on foreign materials for lithium ion batteries
1224977 other countries such as korea and japan have identified advanced battery research and production as competitive priorities we have to make sure not to cede that competitive race
1224978 if we rely on foreign sources for those products we still could in a sense be relying on foreign sources of energy
1224979 you have the rally and you almost get the hangover now where you say you know were not out of the woods yet
1224980 we think we will be looking at record profits this year
1224981 you can have great loan growth and build a solid business without taking undue risk
1224982 we have a very conservative model that relies on core deposit growth and a conservative lending culture
1224983 we didnt go to las vegas and we didnt go to florida
1224984 any loans that go bad i will have to collect on them
1224985 we have been through a lot of ups and downs the vagaries of cyclical economies
1224986 we know how to underwrite loans and how to protect ourselves
1224987 the same customers who are having mortgage pressures are having car payment pressures credit card pressures
1224988 i think its great that we have positive economic data but the biggest driver of this market today is the price of a barrel of oil which continues to be constructive to the market

1224996 has tested positive with the same dna pattern of salmonella saintpaul the strain that has caused a large multi state outbreak of salmonella
1224997 because of the democratic congress delays and the need for action now president bush will sign this bill when he receives it despite our concerns with some provisions including nearly 4 billion to help lenders not the homeowners this legislation is intended to serve
1224998 this is far more than sending a bill to the presidents desk for his signature its sending a message to the american people that the congress of the united states despite an alternative reputation can actually get things done and can work together to achieve a good result
1224999 everybody else in the indictment has pled guilty at some time or other and these were the last two holdouts
1225000 for the last four years our office has quietly worked its way from buyers who lied on their mortgage applications all the way up to the real estate agents and mortgage bankers who participated in the fraud
1225001 will provide a way to provide broadband across long distances at much faster speeds than cellphone networks and wi fi
1225002 while these increases have not for the most part been passed on at the retail level it is inevitable that they will be at some point
1225003 car dealers and other retailers cannot continue to absorb rising costs at the wholesale level and not pass some of these increases on to consumers
1225004 well supported with facts in terms of why the company needs them
1225005 our customers to the best of their ability are passing them on
1225006 but they recognize that their own private label costs are going up and theyve accepted it
1225007 with crude trading up near 130 and a big advance last week some investors are taking chips off the table
1225008 were going to be in a tight trading range this week based on earnings and oil prices i expect more of the same
1225009 the announcement doesnt change the fact that we still dont know whether oil shale development is viable on a commercial scale what effect it would have on scarce western water supplies or where we would get the energy necessary for development
1225010 when do you want to buy an airline when no one else wants to when there arent other buyers
1225011 frontier has a great product we like the management the employees the culture and we like its position competitively in the market
1225012 because brian understands the airline industry and the bankruptcy process so well he recognized that frontier had a good story to tell in all of this
1225013 his connection to colorado and familiarity with the frontier brand and loyalty base here certainly helped as well
1225014 we dont have the ability to predict where oil prices are going to go weve made an investment we believe will be successful across a broad range of oil prices
1225015 frontier is caught in a vise between united airlines and its large hub and southwest and its rapidly growing flight schedule
1225016 you can be assured they have done their due diligence
1225017 its just a long name and in some respects hard to enunciate so were taking a preliminary look at it right now
1225018 we would like something thats easier even members of our board of directors struggle to get the name right its a mouthful
1225019 weve watched what other cities have done but we havent really zeroed in on anything
1225020 you know youre in trouble when your own family cant remember where you work
1225021 i think its going to be in the end a good thing for consumers and be in the public interest
1225022 i hope they keep their edge and dont become a fat and happy monopoly
1225023 could not in good conscience support a government mandated requirement on the backs of american consumers at this time
1225024 its part of the process a company goes through when they want to acquire raw land this is a step in the right direction but its by no means a done deal
1225025 the evidence also shows however that in serving mass market and enterprise customers competitors rely significantly on access to qwests last mile network facilities and qwests other wholesale services in all four msas
1225026 todays fcc action upholds the pro competitive pricing rules that constitute the heart of the 1996 telecommunications act
1225027 this decision is a victory for competition and consumers and ensures that millions of business and residential customers throughout qwests region will continue to benefit from choice innovation and lower prices
1225028 the fccs decision today to deny qwests forbearance petitions will bolster competition that is essential if customers are to continue to enjoy low prices and innovative services and be free from the control of a single dominant incumbent
1225029 a robust competitive broadband marketplace is critical for the nations competitiveness an outcome at odds with attempts by qwest verizon and at amp t to abuse the forbearance process and harm competitors we continue to urge congress and the federal communications commission to reform the forbearance process to put a stop to the bells anti consumer war on competition
1225030 it is frustrating that the new york attorney general has filed this complaint while we have been fully engaged in good faith negotiations with his office to bring liquidity to our clients holding auction rate securities
1225031 you have the gap before the plan can be fully executed
1225032 you kind of have to weather the conditions and you have to weather the fact that youre still the old company in transition
1225033 they want the vehicles to be neat and have a lot of features
1225034 we have seen this and the success of this in europe and around the world
1225035 the strong presumption in favor of markets which has dominated public policy since the late 1970s has been thrown very much into question
1225036 there may be a backlash against markets at the moment
1225037 but the backlash doesnt seem to be informed by any alternative view of how the world works
1225038 even with 4 a gallon gasoline salazar and his fellow democrats are still preventing america from using our own resources to lower gas prices and create new jobs
1225039 the moral in case you havent figured this out is that new democrats dont exist except when theyre running for office
1225040 in office theyre the same old liberals theyve always been and they dont give a rats rear end about you or whats right for the country only about themselves
1225041 spreading falsehoods along with many of the people who want us to essentially give away the public lands of colorado
1225042 this is not about the development of oil shale today that will help us with gas prices
1225043 what this is about is trying to give millions of acres of land away to the oil companies so they can lock it up forever as part of their reserves
1225044 its at the end of the day part of president bushs agenda and vice president cheneys agenda to essentially give away as much of the public oil and gas resources as possible during their term in office
1225045 the companys leading investment performance is driving continued strength in flows which should support assets under management growth in todays volatile markets
1225046 i just hang up on that but he came to my place of business introduced himself i just liked him from the start and he happened to come at an opportune time
1225047 and thats how it was presented that it was totally liquid
1225048 the call dates on these bonds are longer than my wife and i will probably live
1225049 if someone doesnt buy these back i will likely never see my money
1225050 im hoping the state regulatory people will get something done
1225051 i had trouble sleeping for a long time and i put on maybe 15 pounds
1225052 im better now its a lot of money but if its gone its gone
1225053 he presented how things were presented to him by his company
1225054 this is the most important piece of housing legislation in a generation
1225055 this bill offers hope that if we can get this industry up and moving again and provide security for distressed home owners maybe the economy will respond and get back on track as well
1225056 just because the housing market has tumbled doesnt mean we should capriciously finance a big fat government bailout
1225057 multibillion dollar bailout for scam artists and speculative lenders at the expense of american taxpayers
1225058 im concerned that we are putting a massive burden on taxpayers for wall streets bad decisions and those of speculators who took on risky mortgages
1225059 home prices already falling would collapse more homeowners would default
1225060 i must commend the president ive never thanked him for anything
1225061 its a great way to teach kids about respect for the planet
1225062 i have a sense that whole foods is a responsible company with a deeper sense of health and wellness
1225063 two years ago i sort of came out of my green closet
1225064 we definitely have the cost in mind but not to the exclusion of the childs safety and the safety of the childs planet
1225065 i wanted to be near wash park and i wanted a condo because of the convenience
1225066 and i wanted a price point that was under 200 000
1225067 denver has been off and on with the condo conversion market for a long time
1225068 it depends on what your definition of worth it is
1225069 as an apartment it offered certain things that had relative value
1225070 as a condo it has certain things that offer relative value
1225071 can you take an apartment and turn it into a nice condo
1225072 on the inside they go down to the bare bones
1225073 youve got to ask yourself how much different does it look now that its a condo and not an apartment
1225074 when you rent a unit and the boiler goes out you would just call the super
1225075 i would think that would be a big deal if you were buying i would want to have separate utilities
1225076 people are willing to pay a little more per square foot if you give them something that they want
1225077 if im owning i dont want to be next to a regular apartment
1225078 oil is a positive but i think bigger than that is the earnings news is not as catastrophic as people were thinking
1225079 some of the bellwethers are reporting earnings that are better than expected and outside of the financials things arent so bad
1225080 the good news is that women are worried about the right things
1225081 id like to be on a job where i can at least get a car
1225082 does not support the proposition that speculative activity has systematically driven changes in oil prices
1225083 escalator entrapments have occurred for more than 40 years far longer than crocs has been in business and these accidents often are preventable
1225084 its not outrageous to suggest that whats already been done is enough to get the industry profitable in 2009
1225085 were doing all we can to control our costs and to improve our revenue to offset fuel
1225086 it went out at 12 33 p m and came back at 2 11
1225087 i think video streaming is a very big deal i think it adds to the immersion of an event and allows anyone to increase their audience the better the quality the more people will watch and the better the experience
1225088 i think with all of the political data and visualizations they can do combining that with video could make for a very cool ria
1225089 todays announcement is a major boost to frontier and builds momentum toward its emergence from bankruptcy as a viable enterprise the 75 million commitment in dip financing from perseus is a significant vote of confidence in the employees of frontier our product and business plan
1225090 despite the current challenges facing the airline industry these transactions help point the way towards frontiers emergence from bankruptcy as a competitive sustainable airline
1225091 we believe that frontier has the highest quality affordable coach product in the domestic airline industry we are impressed by frontiers excellent employees and friendly customer service as well as the numerous product characteristics that distinguish frontier from its competitors
1225092 industry data supports our conclusion that when given a choice the majority of coach travelers prefer frontier over the competitive options
1225093 the airline industry is in a state of transition and some degree of turmoil although frontier has been buffeted by recent fuel price increases and certain other issues we believe that frontier has proven that it deserves a chance to succeed in this challenging market and we are proud to help it do so
1225094 we have named our acquisition affiliate go flip go llc as a symbol of our desire to a frontier airlines jet at denver international airport prepares for takeoff in 2006 associated press file photo encourage and preserve frontiers unique cultural attributes of course we also want to support larry hector grizwald jack sally the penguins and all the other frontier animals
1225095 escalator entrapments have occurred for more than 40 years far longer than crocs has been in business and these accidents often are preventable
1225096 because the crocs brand is so visible and so popular around the world we have an opportunity to reach millions of consumers of all ages including parents with educational messages that will help draw attention to this important issue
1225097 any soft pliable shoe even flip flops can be dangerous on an escalator
1225098 were doing all we can to control our costs and to improve our revenue to offset fuel
1225099 it is certainly one of the most historically significant cars of the 20th century and maybe the single most important american car
1225100 it was kind of the common car for the common person
1225101 the move out of the city began with the model t and other vehicles particularly after world war i
1225102 it had a very high ground clearance it was easy to repair it was so inexpensive that isolation on the american farm came to an end
1225103 our credit has been exceptional with a score over 800 now were told we have to have additional credit
1225104 the presence of two or fewer accounts within the past five years
1225105 i didnt know what else to do so we got another credit card
1225106 we didnt want it and we didnt need it but what choice did we have
1225107 there are 20 to 30 factors that go into determining an insurance premium and credit based insurance score is only one
1225108 carls the ultimate pragmatist when he felt he didnt have the full win he went for what he could get
1225109 if youre not spending your money finding and developing new oil then theres no new oil
1225110 theres only so much money you can throw at it without being ridiculous
1225111 is likely to cause confusion to cause mistake and to deceive customers
1225112 trade on stop amp shops reputation for value pricing as whole foods tries to shed its longstanding reputation for high prices that has among other things earned it the nickname whole paycheck
1225113 we must continue to make the necessary adjustments to adapt to higher jet fuel prices and restore our profit margins
1225114 were going to find a way to make a huge dent in this problem
1225115 remarkably in the last four years the ugland house has found room for 6 000 new tenants without even adding a new floor
1225116 like everybody else in the industry they are paying higher costs nothing unusual there
1225117 its easier to start things on your home turf rather than going to a market cold where you might not have the connection the input and the lay of the land that you would in your own backyard
1225118 denver has proven itself to be a very strong launching ground for national fast casual restaurants
1225119 these are all of the letters we anticipate sending out related to the capacity reductions weve announced
1225120 the tornado not only destroyed the fences bleachers restrooms and concession stands it left tiny particles of debris embedded in the sod
1225121 it would be kind of fun to see all of the people walking around but im going to work from home and avoid the hassle
1225122 im kind of hoping well experience more business from conventioneers who have last minute needs
1225123 were going to see how it goes if its confusing and doesnt work for us well close for a few days
1225124 we were hearing from our customers that they didnt want to come down here that week
1225125 were hoping its business as usual but were anticipating were going to take a hit
1225126 its going to be more of an inconvenience than actually affecting our business the actual week of the convention will be a challenge
1225127 getting to the office is going to be a bit of a hassle but many of our employees have laptops and can work remotely
1225128 the feeling i get from most tenants is that theyre excited about it its going to be fun
1225129 people from different parts of the country will be in town walking around if they want to explore buying real estate in denver our doors will be open
1225130 the last month was as slow as ive ever seen it during the summer
1225131 our business is very event driven and theres nothing going on at the pepsi center right now
1225132 downtown is going to be busy the streets will be filled with people
1225133 the federal government has set up this system where folks are required to hand money to people they dont know
1225134 of course were all shocked and amazed when the money disappears
1225135 then as the economy turns down you start having problems
1225136 you trust your money to somebody who seems trustworthy and they prove not to be
1225137 were trying to make it more of an american product where we can enjoy it here
1225138 this is like two months in iraq for something that involves literally market stability and calms global jitters
1225139 it is arguable that if it were not enacted at this point that the consequences could be quite severe
1225140 central to the speed with which we emerge from this housing correction
1225141 theres been so many people speculating about oil taking off and how to handle it the whole economy has been focused on it
1225142 it went out at 12 33 p m and came back at 2 11
1225143 we think western union is more defensive than its peers with a much greater percentage of its revenue coming from markets outside the u s and favorable secular trends
1225144 the company continues to post consistent results in an otherwise difficult market and appears to be focused on improving operating margin as revenue growth especially internationally remains robust
1225145 they were so far short of covering the cost of fuel on what is a seasonally good quarter

1225166 but you cannot see anyones shoes from outside the vehicle
1225167 also we could not verify the manner in which the incident occurred
1225168 it was difficult for the victim to demonstrate some of the details of it
1225169 the car wasnt worth much more than that but he doesnt have a car anymore
1225170 he had to carry that around the last four months
1225171 we talk about the presumption of innocence but thats not the reality of what happens
1225172 he said paul im not going to stop and try to help somebody ever again
1225173 this is like a new kids on the block anonymous meeting
1225174 we can all laugh and tell our stories and people actually get it
1225175 that was part of what made it so special before sharing it with your friends
1225176 you really have to get together with people who enjoy it fully other people dont understand
1225177 my other friends all think im nuts but now i have these guys so i dont care anymore
1225178 i have two small kids at home and i work from home so i have zero social interaction with people outside of my immediate family
1225179 for me its not only the chance to gush about how much i love joey its also just being around other people and being social i was fortunate enough to marry a joe but hes my at home joey now i get to have time talking about my new kids on the block joey
1225180 its worth traveling five hours to get somewhere where people get me
1225181 making sure nothing is wrinkled and looking through it all when my husbands not home i live such a professional corporate life during the week this is definitely a release where i can just be silly and reminisce and be myself not that im not myself at work but this is a different part of me
1225182 its ok to be totally crazy and just hang out i never had this before not like this when i was still in school i was the only person who liked the new kids
1225183 like for this mall show i dont think theyre all fessing up to the fact theyre coming i think were going to get a ton of people who come in from out of town to see them but they havent admitted it yet
1225184 i dont think theyre going to be like cher where she keeps doing it and doing it
1225185 thats why im going to so many shows living it up and enjoying the hell out of it this is probably it theyre a boy band theyre not the rolling stones
1225186 a friend of mine asked whether or not well still see each other after the concerts are over
1225187 if you see bernard up there tell him i said hello and i miss him
1225188 i was crushed when he left to be honest with you he was a great football player in his prime and getting ready to play better it was a huge loss for us and hes going to have a huge impact in minnesota with that running game they have and bernard on the outside
1225189 we definitely think devin hester can be a no 1 receiver for us
1225190 i wouldnt doubt anything that devin hester could do whether its returning punts taking a couple of snaps at quarterback playing cornerback i think hell be able to figure it out
1225191 i cant call myself a no 1 receiver right now
1225192 im just playing ball as for the money its no more pressure thats money ive earned the past two years thats money i deserved for what i did
1225193 bernard is a star player an impact player who is going to do what impact players do make big plays
1225194 with devin you go from one type of impact player to another you put the ball in devins hands hes going to find a way to score too
1225195 whats exciting is well get him on the field a lot more
1225196 because hes a return guy he wont be on the field for 65 plays like bernard was
1225197 hes also strategic in that he can shape the future of the company and where polaris goes from here
1225198 as a ceo tom has the rare ability to understand the strategic side of the business well the operational side well and also understands how to handle the street very well

1225203 why did i choose you what did i see in you i saw the heart you hide so well i saw a quiet girl who had a gentle way a way that caught me in its glowing spell
1225204 our oldest who is four and a half saw a doctor who episode where there was a monster under the bed for weeks we had to check his room with him before he went to bed
1225205 i agree with kara i can tell a difference between these and the upset sounds
1225206 all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
1225207 all the oil that theyre talking about i bet you thought i was going to say obama right
1225208 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much

1225223 when youre in this business in the business of dealing with kids it was a little disappointing but you have to honor that
1225224 if a kid doesnt want to play he doesnt want to play

1225254 put simply the united states seeks the help of the state of texas
1225255 we respectfully request that texas take the steps necessary to give effect to the decision
1225256 would endanger americans traveling abroad who are arrested in another country and want to consult with the u s consulate as is their right under the treaty signed by the united states the united states must abide by the international agreements it signs if it does not then it loses power to protect its national interests or in this case to protect americans who are detained in other countries
1225257 a lawyer for yogurt shop defendant robert springsteen says that retested dna evidence proves his client is not guilty and should be released from prison
1225258 sorry rick perry and the government of texas does not recognize the protections of the vienna convention so your request is denied
1225259 we welcome the icjs order of provisional measures in response to mexicos request as a vindication of that institutions faith in the united statess political will and ability to enforce the avena judgment
1225260 we are confident the united states and the state of texas will comply with the icjs order and stay the august 5 th execution of mr medell n
1225261 it is critical that the united states abide by the commitments undertaken when we signed and ratified the vienna convention
1225262 the united states has relied repeatedly on the enforceability of this and other treaty obligations abroad if we do not keep our promises to our international partners we lose the ability to protect our own citizens abroad and damage our nations reputation as a reliable player on the world stage
1225263 texas should stay the pending execution not only out of respect for the icj an international institution that the united states helped build and in which the u s has long been a participant but also out of respect for the u s congress and for the legal obligations that the united states has undertaken to its neighbor mexico
1225264 we would expect no less of mexico or any other vienna convention signatory if the tables were turned
1225265 l a called and asked if they could talk to mark and mark has his home out there and we told him wed do what best for him and his family
1225266 this is it this is the solution im looking for
1225267 the right of lebanon its people army and resistance to liberate or reclaim its land
1225268 swept into the world like a gust of fresh wind
1225269 a sentencing statute must not only narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty it must also ensure sentencing decisions are based upon an individual inquiry
1225270 the texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to be put to death merely for being a party because the law of parties cannot be applied in answering the special issues
1225271 i believe the right and just decision is to commute fosters sentence
1225272 crash on your couch for a couple of days until he got back on his feet
1225273 ours is the only state in the country to apply the
1225274 many texans support the death penalty but i do not believe that any reasonable person in texas believes that a person like jeff wood should be executed who did not kill or intend to kill woods sentence should be commuted just as kenneth fosters was commuted
1225275 my cousin was the person killed by danny not jeff i say this as a family member who realized long ago jeff had no part in my cousins murder and he shouldnt be executed its insane to kill another person who did not kill kris the video showed jeff took no part in it jeff was one of my friends growing up and someone i think deserves a chance if he didnt kill him why should we kill jeff this is ridiculous
1225276 it is against federal law to remove before sale the label stating the objects origins
1225277 as a child of a native american woman and a black man he was not accepted by his mothers tribe
1225278 while tonya and carlton presented the picture of a happy well adjusted family troubles started at an early age akee exhibited learning and behavioral problems as early as elementary school these continued throughout his school years his problems were only exacerbated by his fathers strict and abusive punishments he suffered broken fingers cuts bruises and a broken leg after his father threw him to the ground when he was seven years old and endured many trips to the hospital as a result of his fathers punishment
1225279 despite the fact that they may have been legally qualified to serve
1225280 the capital prosecution of an african american man by an all white jury from a jurisdiction with such an extensive record of discrimination in exactly that arena should cause doubts in the first instance
1225281 where there is evidence of a deeper level of discrimination that is by its nature well camouflaged a call for a halt to mr turners scheduled execution is compelled at least until further investigation can be conducted
1225282 executions are held out as a talisman that will provide the victim with closure
1225283 this belief serves in part as a rationale for executions but in mr turners case an eye for an eye truly does leave a family blind twice robbed of their own
1225284 i do not wish to see my sisters only child executed i believe in my heart that my sister would only have wanted akee to receive the help that he needed to restore his mind to a sound state
1225285 i dont think carlton should be executed i dont want him to be executed now that i know more of the details that led to the murders i realize that he needs help killing him is just another murder nothing is going to bring my cousin back killing him will just hurt our family again the way tonya and carltons murders did

1225288 heroes and warriors heed my call it s been merely a week since father had been slain and up until now i am deeply troubled by his loss i know there are those who remain loyal to my father and to our clan thus i summon for all brave souls who wish to join me in my quest to regain the honor that my clan rightfully deserves once i have created an army strong enough to join my cause i assure you we will take the heat of the battle to our enemies and win this war
1225289 divinities help me avenge my father s death and to reclaim the land that is ours
1225290 demon isn t it unwise to call me by such name the lady felmaiden would have your head on a platter if she heard you

1225292 im in regular contact with all my data providers and none of them have had an issue with my app
1225293 apples secrecy keeps them from properly analyzing out their apps with tons of users the way other companies do who arent so worried about secrecy
1225294 the claims are serious and the standard of proof required reflects that
1225295 we want to offer our sincerest apologies to affected bloggers and their readers
1225296 at blogger we strongly believe that you own and should control your posts and other data we understand that you trust us to store and serve your blog and incidents like this one are a betrayal of that trust
1225297 exposing unlawful executions will help innocent people on death row and hold prosecuting attorneys accountable
1225298 a police officer sitting in his car several feet away from protesters milling in a police designated free speech zone verbally threatened protest participants with assault by taser waving it in several peoples direction before deciding on local activist forest student student was shocked with the long distance barb taser for twenty seconds before being collected and arrested
1225299 brutality like this will continue unless we stand our ground and show the establishment that repression will only help our numbers grow we need as many people at the port monday night as possible a strong show of solidarity will make the police think twice about their casual brutality and larger numbers ensure the safety of everyone especially those who cannot get arrested and those who are susceptible to chemical weapons

1225305 the statistics from this study confirm what has widely been known not only is a degree critical to getting a job but it is also key to advancing in ones career
1225306 and given the current economic climate a degree might be needed just to keep your job
1225307 the message is loud and clear that in todays competitive job market if you dont have the right education others will pass you by
1225308 we found that 22 of people who started college but didnt finish have been denied a job raise or a promotion what is shocking is that workers are telling us that not having a degree is becoming a significant roadblock in their careers
1225309 the governments recent strict enforcement of measures controlling the movement of vehicles and goods in and out of the beijing area have rendered biodiesel production at our beijing plant impractical for the time being
1225310 but many are growing increasingly frustrated with their lack of payback on innovation spending and some firms are apparently starting to think twice this could have major implications for corporate competitiveness
1225311 for most firms the problem of disappointing returns is fixable but it demands a sustained and concerted effort as well as an understanding of what to focus on which many companies seem to lack its something they desperately need to develop
1225312 with competitive pressures rising globally now is precisely the wrong time for companies to be shying away from spending on innovation if that is indeed what were seeing
1225313 instead companies should be redoubling their efforts innovation is one of the few perhaps the only means of generating sustainable competitive advantage companies need to recognize that and structure their priorities and activities accordingly
1225314 at a time when data center energy demand is accelerating we are significantly reducing energy usage and impact on the utility grid at the mcclellan park facility
1225315 we will continue to design environmentally responsible data centers and consider leed as a baseline for our facilities going forward
1225316 the reduction in energy usage significantly reduces the facilitys carbon footprint and impact on the utility grid
1225317 the energy use of the adc data center meets a recently considered impossible to achieve pue of 1 1 with an energy savings of 1 million to 2 million per year this project stands to be the largest energy savings achieved ever in sacramento and indeed the rest of california
1225318 adc has taken a leadership role in designing one of the countrys lowest energy data centers this is the key component of the leed platinum certification and more importantly in making this facility the lowest carbon emitting data center of its kind in california
1225319 adc is joining our growing roster of green businesses at mcclellan park as one of the largest redevelopment projects in northern california mcclellan park is one of the leading recyclers of buildings and rather than sending the waste to the landfill we reuse concrete and asphalt from our demolition projects we are also cleaning and recycling contaminated land and have attracted numerous businesses that are involved in green activities mcclellan park is the epicenter of green development in the sacramento region and is actively seeking environmentally conscious tenants our tenants include solar manufacturing hybrid automobile battery testing and repair paint recycling and soon will include some of the areas greenest buildings like adc
1225320 from any humane perspective state sponsored killing of people we know did not commit murder should be way beyond the pale
1225321 i have said repeatedly i think the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes
1225322 i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that does not violate our constitution
1225323 although i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime i support the u s supreme courts ruling in part because it will make children safer and in part because i believe that death is a disproportinate punishment in cases that do not include murder
1225324 the industry has become star dependent everyone wants recovery of his investment and working with stars becomes the safe bet
1225325 there is more and more money coming in the market ever since the corporate world has entered the world of cinema
1225326 also the actors are aware of the fact that they can ask for more money
1225327 no hard work and aiming for quick money seems to have become the motto of filmmakers at the moment
1225328 theyre going to put that guy to death for that
1225329 i dont want mr bower to die for something that he didnt do
1225330 i know in my heart that he didnt do it i just could not in my conscience sit back and just go oh well sorry
1225331 if he would have gotten life in prison i cant sit here and honestly say i would have done something different life is what 30 years in the state of texas but he got the death penalty and theres no getting out of that
1225332 whatever you think about the benefits of having capital punishment no one could possibly argue that executing an innocent man is in the interests of the state or our society
1225333 our interests as lawyers and as people should be that our government when in doubt should not go forward with an execution there is ample evidence to give people reasonable doubt about whether les committed these murders in my view the evidence is compelling that he didnt
1225334 dna is not going to make all that go away its another delaying tactic its normal we expect it theres four dead men and all the evidence points straight to lester leroy bower jr
1225335 i realized that i had no idea about what i may have gotten myself into or what i may have literally just missed
1225336 so then october rolls around november december and we get into january then all of a sudden they fbi agents show up and once you kind of start a lie it just kind of grows and it rolls along it just consumed me you ask why would an intelligent person do something like that i find that hard to explain
1225337 dont believe anything i say im not the one who has come forward and finally told exactly what happened out there
1225338 he missed me so much he had come all the way down here to see me
1225339 he told me to drive straight through sherman dont stop and dont do anything to get us stopped
1225340 he said they had a dope deal that went bad and they had to kill four people i asked him who killed four people he said me and ches and rocky i assumed at the time that bear was there too and of course he was
1225341 ches girlfriend and i were in the kitchen and ches and lynn were in the living room and they were pretty drunk
1225342 they had their guns out talking about it laughing about it ches thought everything was funny he said something about did you see that guys eyes when he opened the door or did you see that guys face when i shot him
1225343 i kept asking the girlfriend did you hear that she kept telling me no and that i needed to not hear it either
1225344 had been a cop and the killings had happened because things had gone wrong
1225345 there was a big part of me who still wanted to believe it was all dopers talking bragging
1225346 but then there was another part of me that thought well maybe they did but i wasnt going to stick around to find out i called my mom and i told her that i needed money that i needed to get out of there right then
1225347 was my fear of ches and lynn bigger than my fear of not doing the right thing
1225348 i wanted to do the right thing but not at the expense of my children i just had to know that i could protect them and do the right thing
1225349 the strength of the case against this man the lies he told the fbi investigators
1225350 the fact that he made phone calls setting up the meeting with one of the victims that the meeting happened at the time of the murders and portions of the aircraft stolen from the crime scene found at his residence as well as a tremendous amount of other circumstantial evidence and eyewitnesses with the strength of all that the solid evidence that was there against him doesnt go away just because someone said something in an affidavit
1225351 i would feel really sad for the state of texas
1225352 for the future i will strive to see that the financial health of the government remains strong
1225353 although we have moved forward on levee 37 and redevelopment efforts of the downtown and randhurst we are at critical junctures in seeing those becoming a reality
1225354 i can guarantee you that we wont take anywhere nearthat time
1225355 we will work on it i cantgive you any deadlines
1225356 my cousin was the person killed by danny not jeff i say this as a family member who realized long ago jeff had no part in my cousins murder and he shouldnt be executed its insane to kill another person who did not kill kris the video showed jeff took no part in it jeff was one of my friends growing up and someone i think deserves a chance if he didnt kill him why should we kill jeff this is ridiculous
1225357 as we explained through interpretation exactly what was going on a mother fought back the tears knowing that her daughter would get an education
1225358 we are sponsoring these children for 200 a year and it will change the lives of the entire family
1225359 its one of the safest motorcycles ive ever been on
1225360 and it looks very cool it makes people stop and take notice
1225361 it opens the department up to the people who live here in lake villa
1225362 its been happening since we got it people see it walk over and strike up a conversation with officers then they start talking about other things
1225363 we are policemen so if we need it we can use it for traffic stops and other incidents
1225364 it will respond to calls and we will make a stop with it if we need to
1225365 we have a great department in that they are very committed to the community
1225366 this will help them get out and closer to the community
1225367 a squad car only gets 10 miles a gallon but this gets 30
1225368 but this is really a conversation starter its really designed to break down the barriers between a police officer and the community that a squad car creates
1225369 its arbitrary and capricious to classify the first offense as sexual
1225370 even with moving to a new place i do not feel safe in my house
1225371 i am afraid that he will find me hurt me and take our son every little sound i hear scares me
1225372 theres just a sense about him that when he talks hes telling you something you cant live without
1225373 he has us believing we can do anything and that feeling is spreading like wildfire throughout the team what does he bring he brings confidence
1225374 and now were inexperienced at safety its not good to be starting over in an area where you were weak thats wills task to make us complicated enough back there to give offenses problems and make it simple enough for our young guys to handle
1225375 greg davis has promised me hes going to score some points
1225376 i tell the guys if were not coaching you hard were not coaching you
1225377 so were going to coach the guys texas football is important to and putting those horns on every saturday is important to those are the guys who are committed to doing it and were going to coach those guys hard
1225378 your actions speak so loud i cant hear what youre saying
1225379 i understand it now and i tell it to our players here at texas
1225380 you talk about being a great player you talk about being committed you talk about being a great teammate a great student or a great son your actions speak so loudly i cant hear what youre telling me because your actions arent exactly what youre telling me you want to be your actions are what make your character thats something that i live by daily am i exhibiting the right actions for the kids doing the right things for the kids or making the right decisions are we coaching something and not acting something out i think thats a saying i always remember my dad saying
1225381 nothing fazes the guy he gets more hyped than the players but he knows exactly what hes doing a lot of coaches jump around and get distracted or fail to connect with their players will jumps around because what hes telling you is working
1225382 nick saban even yelled at will not to hurt me
1225383 im a defensive guy thats my baby so ive followed him and watched his teams and will is an excellent coach
1225384 he does an excellent job of teaching and his teams play aggressively im sure that will continue hopefully well be able to handle it when we play him but he does an excellent job
1225385 my dream was to play major college football growing up
1225386 i didnt really care where i just wanted to play on saturday and all of a sudden it was sort of taken from me
1225387 but it goes back to what my dad always told me 10 percent of life is what happens to you and 90 percent is what you do with it so we can think life is not fair or you can roll your sleeves up and go to work thats what i decided to do
1225388 wills first day in pads in tackling drills we knew he was going to be a physical guy
1225389 he would put his face on you hes still as intense as he was his freshman year its a direct correlation we have this quote in house that says players are a reflection of their coach not to knock anyone else everyone has done a great job here but because i had the pleasure of playing with will these players are a reflection of him and the way he played
1225390 when the opportunity to come to texas presented itself i leaned heavily on mcwhorter davis and wynn and their idea of coach brown and the university and the kind of job it is
1225391 i looked at the blue collar attitude of that construction crew and how they worked a lot of hours
1225392 they bring the lunch pail to work every day and thats the mentality i want us to take
1225393 its a huge source of pride the way coach muschamp hands it out
1225394 its not in your group meeting room tucked away its on the wall for the whole team to see if youre not producing everyone sees it
1225395 i dont have the experience a lot of coaches have
1225396 he was a very bright guy entertaining a healthy sense of humor
1225397 he knew the right moment to laugh and help everybody people loved him as a co worker
1225398 when you pick up a two foot eight inch human being and throw him to the floor it hurts
1225399 our officers are keeping more guns off the streets and working harder to reduce those shootings
1225400 of course shot placement and medical advances have helped keep some of the shootings we have had from becoming murders but were working hard to get those numbers down
1225401 our officers are using a lot more computer generated stats to get a better look at the patterns of violence and that helps put them where we need more police presence
1225402 our officers are also making a lot more traffic stops and hopefully theyre getting more warrant arrests as well as traffic violations to keep the bad guys off the streets
1225403 we have meetings every tuesday to discuss our strategies when it comes to preventing violent crimes and the criminal sexual assault is one we spend a lot of time on
1225404 thats a tough one to answer other than that our officers are keeping their eyes open and doing everything they can to be seen in the community
1225405 thats a large increase yet its only eight more and the arson numbers can be deceiving especially since most of these are car fires
1225406 as times get tougher and tougher we see more folks trying to get out from under that payment
1225407 those are the best tools we have to keep aurora a safe place to work and live
1225408 but we cant sit back on these numbers we need to continue to be vigilant
1225409 with the soft retail economy its not happening this year

1225416 so we rented a car and drove we have to be here to check everything
1225417 we just sat here and watched the planes take off and land

1225421 i was expecting a flat gray backdrop for this fight and immediately impressed at the quality of the art even in the cellblocks instead of hazing into a blur at the limits of the draw distance the walls floors and distant objects took on an angular yet familiar look exactly what youd expect in a comic book the effect amplified the detail in the foreground drawing attention to the incredible job cryptic has done with applying shaders and textures to the cell shaded character models and objects the comic book effect is carried forward in the animations where freeze frames at the end of exaggerated swings spell casts and other actions punctuate the moves as well as a wham or biff bubble ever could
1225422 were trying to be as close as we can on impact fees so we dont have that situation where one community is significantly higher or lower than another

1225437 perbuatan mana mana individu muslim sama ada pemimpin atau rakyat yang meletakkan kalungan bunga tabik hormat dan bertafakur yang dilakukan untuk tugu negara adalah bercanggah dengan prinsip prinsip akidah islam yang anti kepada sebarang unsur keberhalaan
1225438 perbuatan seperti itu seakan menjadikan tugu berkenaan berhala yang dihormati sekiranya pun pelakunya tidak mempunyai sebarang iktikad bahawa itu semua memberi manfaat dan mudarat maka perbuatan itu adalah sia sia dan bodoh ia tetap haram kerana meniru perbuatan musyrikin
1225439 jika pelaku beriktikad itu memberikan kemanfaatan kepada keamanan kedamaian ruh mereka yang telah meninggal dunia maka itu adalah perbuatan syirik yang jelas akidah islam menentang sebarang unsur keberhalaan
1225440 pemimpin atau sesiapa sahaja yang terlibat dalam perbuatan ini hendaklah bertaubat kepada allah dan kembali kepada akidah islam yang sebenar

1225510 not a single country that has been declared aids free
1225511 setting this precedent is very important indeed to stomp out stigma and discrimination and while we see this openness at international conferences we do not find the same replicated at national ones
1225512 the growing hiv epidemic among msm in asia reminds me of the times when it was found only in the west and australia the history of aids is one of surprises it pops up where and when you least expect it and thus its far too early to declare victory
1225513 stigma is a state of mind expressed sometimes in very violent ways specially when it comes to msms

1225543 the market size in revenues for aftermarket remotes promises a cagr compound annual growth rate of about 10 percent between now and 2013
1225544 that rate increases to 14 percent for mid level remotes which cost between 30 and 250
1225545 increasing options for content the heavy buying of expensive flat tvs and rational prices for the mid level remote have all played to increase consumer willingness to purchase and desire for the more capable control benefits
1225546 despite the economic headwinds the pc market continued to show its resilience

1225552 its perfectly possible that bruce ivins really is the anthrax attacker that he perpetrated the attacks and did so alone perhaps the fbi is in possession of mountains of conclusive evidence that once revealed will leave no doubt that ivins is the guilty party but no rational person could possibly assume that to be the case given the paltry amount of facts many of which contradict one another that are now known
1225553 for abc the best case scenario is that its reporting was simply wrong for whatever reason the worst case scenario government sources deliberately used the network to make the public believe that saddam was poisoning us with anthrax

1225557 it is hard to believe that clark rockefeller would have fallen for such a ruse as the old boat taking on water trick one would have thought that he would have been suspicious of everything its not as if this story was not on every tv radio and print medium in the us and the caribbean let alone the world
1225558 i was disappointed by the news that clark rockefeller was apprehended with his 7 year old daughter in baltimore
1225559 people are always so very inclined to side with the mother in custody cases the mother isnt always the fit parent but unless it can be proven to the court that shes endangering or neglecting the child they normally get default custody i see with my own eyes every day the fact that the mother isnt always the best choice and shouldnt be the first choice of the courts

1225566 uh huh i was nervous my tummy felt funny and my legs were even a little shaky

1225575 social networking within and around the enterprise can deliver a number of benefits to a company though some may be difficult to quantify
1225576 for example many networks can be searched by keyword offering fast and easy access to company wide pools of expertise one vendor of these solutions targets only trade show and conference organizers their networks allow people attending the event to save time by learning who else is going and setting up meetings in advance

1225590 it is difficult to agree with the view of the majority of the court that the changes brought about by the thirteenth amendment did not have the effect of the constitution becoming at least quasi federal for the presence of certain unitary features in a constitution does not prevent the system of government from being federal in practice in a sense therefore the constitutional position now obtaining in sri lanka is not substantially different from the kind of federal system that prevails in india
1225591 provincial councils are on par with the parliament and that the provincial councils come within the category of subsidiary sovereign bodies this demonstrates the division of legislative power

1225598 it hasnt sunk in yet im getting teased by my mates but ive got no plans for a pipe and slippers yet
1225599 como un fan de los white sox el equipo de chicago esto duele un poco
1225600 four years ago it was a whole extra exciting thing that i really wasnt expecting i didnt know how to take it and i was kind of living in the moment this time is what ive been training for
1225601 there are a lot of people who are three four and maybe even five time olympians i dont know if this is a great feat maybe a third olympics would make it official
1225602 ill probably need a personal best if not at least a sub 11 seconds race theres a ton of people who could medal
1225603 i dont hype myself up saying theyre gunning for me and im the best or that im the worst and i need to go get them i feel like its a level playing field
1225604 maybe a little bit of a vet because there arent too many of what we call third generation olympians
1225605 it is the best job in the ioc because you have the honor to represent the voice of the athlete i think frankie will take the athletes commission to the next level hes a perfect fit for the role
1225606 drastic action that attracts a crowd or affects public order
1225607 we were devastated after athens and resolved to make whatever changes were necessary to address any shortcomings
1225608 our plan has been driven very much by the athens experience and not wishing to repeat it
1225609 by the end of august we will know how successful we have been in our approach
1225610 athletes from overseas spent a lot of time in australia in the build up to 2000 this meant we didnt have to travel to the extent that we would normally leading to savings that could be spent in other areas
1225611 preparations for the 2004 olympics in europe were expensive and were made more so because of inflation and the relative strength of the dollar against european currencies at the time
1225612 in an expensive equipment based sport this had a significant impact on all areas of our program and the ability of our athletes to properly prepare all this coupled with the benefits of the familiarity of a home games in 2000 certainly had an impact in 2004
1225613 cadel will be flying in tomorrow and the news is that hell definitely be riding in the road race
1225614 and depending on how he goes after that he may ride in the time trial but that wont be decided until after the road race
1225615 the mention in the last statement that downside growth risks appeared to have diminished somewhat now looks like a premature conclusion
1225616 the extension and enhancement of the liquidity facilities suggests the fed remains concerned about financial stability and thus is unlikely to raise rates in the near term
1225617 with oil and commodity prices not growing nearly as rapidly as earlier this year headline inflation rates are set to moderate by the end of the year
1225618 is likely to continue with hawkish rhetoric reiterating their vigilance against inflation but also noting that their expectation that slack in the economy should help mitigate inflationary pressures over several quarters
1225619 were pretty well positioned for the downside risks we might encounter from here
1225620 i worry a little bit more about the prospects for inflation
1225621 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1225622 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1225623 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1225624 the changes that are occurring in china are a microcosm of the changes in the rest of the world
1225625 weve been advising the athletes that this incident took place 4 000 km 2 500 miles away
1225626 securitys extremely tight around the olympics village and at all levels ive been to a quite a few games and the only one ive been to that is comparable is moscow
1225627 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1225628 there were lots of dogs and they have left lots of things behind and nobody even tried to collect them
1225629 i have no idea how i can train in such conditions who would clean the discus after every throw
1225630 i always thought i was a very fortunate kid i grew up in a place where i wasnt in serious danger
1225631 it was safer in the north of the country the war was further south but its completely different now you can travel around the country safely which used to be impossible
1225632 i was a young kid watching the game on tv
1225633 i think that was wrong of charles barkley but thats basketball we prefer to be humble
1225634 well will do everything we can to try to win one or two games and qualify for the next round
1225635 china and germany are tough teams but we will try to steal those games
1225636 the other teams in the group spain are world champions and greece and the u s are just very very tough
1225637 no question the u s have the best players in the world
1225638 it will be an honor for us to play them
1225639 theres no way you can compare that american team with this american team
1225640 this will never work i cant do not good enough

1225644 i cant wait to process the data from this nfl betting survey and see where everything stands
1225645 students and teachers will be able to buy the nfl betting documental book at a substantial discount
1225646 i align myself with the views of regener furnari who is not only my nfl betting industry rep but also debating for more transparency in the industry as a whole
1225647 much of the market was dominated by bartoletti shorrock inc until today now our nfl betting products have the edge
1225648 were working hard to improve our search engine rankings because this will increase our nfl betting sales like never before
1225649 thirty years from now the big university campuses will be relics universities wont survive its as large a change as when we first got the printed book
1225650 do you realize that the cost of higher education has risen as fast as the cost of health care and for the middle class family college education for their children is as much of a necessity as is medical care without it the kids have no future
1225651 such totally uncontrollable expenditures without any visible improvement in either the content or the quality of education means that the system is rapidly becoming untenable higher education is in deep crisis

1225661 generally though i think a devils advocate approach might be better and id advise someone to think very carefully a tattoo might look cool and sexy when you are in your twenties and thirties but there comes a point when things start to fill out and stretch and then it might not look so good
1225662 dont get a tattoo every f ers got one these days

1225664 the news of that abject surrender provoked an explosion of outrage across jammu
1225665 the governor has violated the sasb act he cannot act unilaterally any decision of the board has to be endorsed by at least five members
1225666 he is also in contempt of the high court which had passed an interim order approving the transfer of 800 kanals of land to the board in baltal
1225667 i dont recall such a massive bandh in recent years
1225668 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley any more jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
1225669 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley

1225673 significant tsunami energy did not propagate through the waters separating india and sri lanka during the december 2004 event and did not impact much the southern part of kerala deepening and widening the sethu canal will provide a more direct route for some of the tsunami energy to travel and impact southern kerala

1225680 in india itself there are more than 500 000 villages who have never heard about jesus there is neither a church nor has any missionary been in these parts our responsibility as the chosen one of20god is to make an opportunity for these people so that they too can hear the word of god
1225681 new meaning for religion and politics simultaneously mixing the religious with business and finance creating spectacular events and media personalities
1225682 liberal christians along with many others in india certainly have serious misgivings about
1225683 the traditional church is however reluctant to admit it and take action against this especially in the face of rising hindu and islamic fundamentalism
1225684 muslims say they are proud to be muslim christians say they are proud to be christian

1225690 getting down on yourself wont make it happen any faster plus you run the risk of getting burnt out faster and losing the focus you started out with you better watch out you do that then youll wonder why you really arent seeing your results then youll blame it on something lame like age and youre only 45 so knock it off
1225691 you will get were you want if you do what i tell you i promise

1225696 the islamic nation has witnessed a long period of humiliation in which blood has been spilt the torn off limbs have multiplied the injuries have increased and the cries of the muslims have risen in many lands such as palestine afghanistan bosnia chechnya tajikistan uzbekistan kosovo turkmenistan iraq the philippines indonesia the arabian peninsula and other muslim countries

1225712 the punjab and bengal hold the key in the present election
1225713 the punjab is a key and prosperous province of pakistan
1225714 the punjab holds the key to the future of india
1225715 key provinces of bengal and the punjab had voted overwhelmingly in pakistans favour the leagues score in sindh was flawed due to the post nomination rebellion of g m syed but a mid term election in december 1946 returned a massive verdict in pakistans favor rectifying the previously flawed situation the frontier vote was somewhat disappointing although not too inextricable because of a host of reasons but the call for pakistan really picked up during 1946 47 to a point that in the frontier referendum of july 1947 the vote in pakistans favor was 99 percent of the votes cast and about 51 per cent of the total electorate in the muslim minority provinces the aggregate percentage of seats won for pakistan was 89 9 per cent the contribution of these provinces is also noteworthy on three counts first the major contributions to the leagues election fund came from bombay presidency the gujrati muslim business houses in transvaal south africa and the muslim businessmen and merchants of calcutta while even the punjab being short of funds to the tune of rs 300 000 these donations enabled the muslim league not only to offset somewhat the congress edge in terms of funds e g the congress allocated rs 150 000 for muslim seats in bengal and provided for more funds from g d birla congress chief financier but also to fight the elections successfully in the muslim majority provinces second was the singular contribution of the ali students during the election campaign in the punjab sindh and the frontier as delineated and documented by mukhtar zaman in his students role in the pakistan movement third and most important was the altruism of muslims in the minority provinces in voting for pakistan the muslims in the majority areas were voting for power to themselves but those in the minority areas were voting for power the their brethren in the majority areas they were moreover voting for scuttling the maneuverability and the immense advantage that the inclusion of these areas in an all india federation or confederation would have provided them and to offer themselves as scapegoats
1225716 it would be highly improper for me to interfere or to influence the activities proceedings and decisions of the parliamentary board provincial or central or for that matter of any tribunal set up by the league no inducement can ever be given to any person howsoever high he may be in joining the muslim league it will be corruption to do so and no honest man can be a party to it
1225717 i have been authorised by his majestys government to place before the indian political leaders proposals designed to ease the present political situation and to advance india towards her goal of full self government
1225718 the appropriate time for fresh elections for the central and provincial legislatures will be discussed at the conference
1225719 finally i would ask you all to help in creating the atmosphere of goodwill and mutual confidence that is essential if we are to make progress the destiny of this great country and of the many millions who live in it depends on the wisdom and good understanding of the leaders both of action and of thought british and indian at this critical moment of indias history
1225720 every province and every district must be thoroughly and systematically organized and the result of the elections would be the acid test and the verdict given at the polling booths will be the main criterion by which the solidarity and unity of musalmans will be judged both in india and abroad all over the world
1225721 i have not made any appeal for funds since 1942 as there was no need for it but i want to impress upon our people that we do require money now to face these elections all over the vast sub continent of india in eleven provinces as well as for the centre i hope that my appeal will meet with cordial and generous response
1225722 the elections will give a clear verdict on the issue whether the muslims of india stands for pakistan or for akhand hindustan it is therefore a question of life and death with muslims of india if we are defeated in the elections then we would be nowhere but i have full faith in you and i see clearly that musalmans of india today understand the issues before them we have no press nor financial support the congress has but we muslims are politically more conscious than hindus are the handicaps notwithstanding
1225723 give me the silver bullets and i will finish the job
1225724 the pakistan movement started when the first muslim put his foot on the soil of sindh the gateway of islam in india

1225733 the permission to allow the export of limited quantities of strawberries was a smoke screen at best we exported less than 9 of our produce and part of this allowed export expired at the karm abu salem crossing due to the prolonged wait of the produce directly under the sun our lives have been poisoned we farm the land then we destroy the crop or sell it dirt cheap i do not know if i will farm my land again i own 50 dunums of land planted with potatoes most probably i wont be able to spray it with insecticides that are not available insects and disease will undoubtedly destroy the crop

1225798 its a small island that imports a lot of its culture from elsewhere as a teenager i spent all my time listening to tapes from jamaica clashes between sound systems such as killamanjaro and stone love the latest songs by artists such as buju banton bermudian people like to party too so any excuse is good enough for someone to string up a set of speakers and for people to start dancing thats how i started out playing songs and chatting over them with my friends
1225799 the culture is very mixed in bermuda and were closely linked to jamaica in many ways reggae crowds can be very demanding but if they like you they will show you love like no one else its that reaction that drives me so with every record and every performance i try to do something special reggae has always been in my life so i dont want people to say that im good for a white guy i want them to think the music i make is good period
1225800 my relationship with reggae began with me listening to my older brothers record collection artists like dennis brown garnett silk and beres hammond
1225801 what i liked was how universal the music was themes of love justice and truth that anyone could understand thats where my inspiration comes from i cant pretend to be anything im not so i dont sing in patois i sing in jamaican english because thats where i learned the language and i dont talk about growing up in the ghetto because i didnt i want to make positive music for all people and that includes a jamaican audience
1225802 sometimes people are still surprised to find out that i am not jamaican

1226023 the government has been assured he is being treated humanely
1226024 any effort to act on his case while he is still before the courts would be premature
1226025 notwithstanding its leadership in international efforts to recognize child soldiers as victims in need of special protection and rehabilitation canada has remained virtually silent in omars case hiding behind vague assurances from the us government that omar is receiving humane treatment and a fair trial in face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary as a result omar now faces the prospect of being the first child to be prosecuted for war crimes in modern history he is to be tried before a military tribunal whose procedures are designed to secure convictions based on evidence derived from torture and coercion and that fails to meet the minimum requirements for a fair trial under international law prime minister stephen harper must finally ensure khadr receives the same consular support that any other canadian detainee or not would receive its time for canada to intervene as so many other countries have done to ensure that the charges against its citizens are dealt with that he is tried in a legitimate court and that he receives due process

1226030 solzhenitsyn was the personification of our nations intensity of the moral power of the russian people i remember well the uproar that the publication of his novella one day in the life of ivan denisovich caused in society it was a revelation that absolutely inverted our way of thinking it became a lesson for most of us it changed all of us truly it was a revolution in the point of view of the entire society no other statement caused such a forceful reaction on the public consciousness as this literary masterpiece did
1226031 the death of this great man one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20 th century is an irreplaceable loss to russia and the entire world aleksandr isaevich devoted his entire life to the motherland he served her as a true citizen and patriot and his heart ached over the fate of the russian people and the true state of the country
1226032 he considered them as the most important props of the state and society and fought for their preservation the idea of the enrichment of the russian people is forever connected with his name his studies of our national history made an enormous contribution to the development of world culture and influenced the personal development of millions of people his name is forever connected with the fate of russia the memory of aleksandr isaevich solzhenitsyn shall always be in our hearts

1226078 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
1226079 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
1226080 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
1226081 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
1226082 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
1226083 i think its got more positives because it basically gives people access whats the harm in that its just making music a part of everyones lives
1226084 there was no shortage of photos of my friends dad smiling
1226085 which shares a piece of his heart and soul on paper i was comforted knowing that his son and wife would always know what was in tims heart it is right there in black and white
1226086 i should go find that it sounds like what i need
1226087 ill get to all these pictures when im waiting up for her to come home when shes a teenager
1226088 your right mom you told me and told me to write down information names dates etc on my photos of eritriea albania and other places she has worked with displaced people and i didnt and now i dont remember their names and other things i wish i knew now
1226089 this is a 22 hectare site of which at least 11 is public open space
1226090 its concrete and bitumen now and has been for nearly 100 years
1226091 this is going to be one of the great sites of sydney
1226092 last week the prime minister said he wanted sydney to be the asia pacific finance hub
1226093 thats only going to happen if we deliver barangaroo and if weve got sufficient office space in this city to house these new finance workers
1226094 if that was to be approved it would be all delivered in the southern commercial precinct
1226095 the southern commercial precinct is already approved with existing building envelopes and the 120 000 square metres would be delivered within those building envelopes so the overshadowing and the wind effectuation is being taken into account
1226096 i would be thrilled proud and excited to become the leader he said
1226097 im going chop your head off and send it to hell
1226098 it is always a concern to be able to get crew on and off the ship when needed
1226099 i guess the main function to it is spotting the japanese fleet it effectively triples your range while youre out at sea in how far you can find ships
1226100 to send two fast ships to the southern ocean with the purpose of continuously keeping the japanese whaling fleet on the run
1226101 last campaign we managed effectively to halve the japanese whaling quota and hopefully this year we will stop them shut them down completely
1226102 its not something we can spend that much money on as this is a donation based organisation
1226103 we do rely on the funds of generous supporters to help us out so we kind of work within our limits
1226104 one of them is that there are a lot of places here that can help us out with the work done on the ship
1226105 the other reason of course is to give the people of brisbane the opportunity to come down and see the ship
1226106 weve had a lot of support from brisbane over the years and wed really like to thank the supporters and give them an opportunity to come down and see the ship
1226107 these may well represent only the tip of the iceberg in terms of national concerns about the reliability and validity of this years results
1226108 but we dont want to commoditise the managed print market we want to get coverage for the whole market in terms of end users but we dont want a saturated market in terms of resellers
1226109 we think theres an opportunity for resellers to capture an ongoing revenue stream which they may not have done previously but also to do that with margin opportunities and without a sting in the tail in terms of customer satisfaction
1226110 you read the hqcc report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1226111 look what this report tells us september 2005 issues are raised about this doctors competence they get a report from a senior surgeon quite a damning report
1226112 absolutely nothing is done for another 12 months until the whistleblowers go to a member of the federal parliament
1226113 i think its actually damaging to continue to prosecute the line that nothing has changed in queensland health
1226114 what i emphasised in our interview this morning was that these were matters that occurred between 2004 and 2006
1226115 since the bundaberg commission of inquiry there have been substantial changes to queensland health particularly how we offer support to whistleblowers
1226116 what occurred in mackay was a doctor not being properly supervised not being properly supervised by whom not a bureaucrat by a senior doctor and who was that senior doctor reporting to another senior doctor
1226117 stephen robertson accuses me and others of bureaucrat bashing his solution to this problem is doctor bashing
1226118 he wants to bring in a change to make it a criminal offence for doctors not to report their colleagues what about doing something to make it a criminal offence for bureaucrats to sit for 12 months doing nothing or nothing effective to solve these problems
1226119 i am not tight or mean ronnie wood who is a great mate keeps saying i am hes such an a hole ron he says im tighter then two coats of paint i am careful with money ronnie isnt

1226138 in a world where the effect of extreme weather events is becoming more severe and the potential impact of global warming is becoming ever more apparent the met office plays an increasingly vital role in researching and forecasting these events the new supercomputer is an important step in delivering our strategic targets
1226139 the met office provides essential services to the nation saving lives and protecting property through its weather forecasts and climate advice i am very pleased to approve the replacement of the met offices supercomputer which will enable it to take advantage of latest technology and thereby deliver enhanced services to the public and both government and commercial customers
1226140 god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ
1226141 what do you think and feel about the cross of christ
1226142 god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ
1226143 i have abraham for my forefather i am not a dark unenlightened heathen i am one of the favored people of god i have been admitted into covenant with god by circumcision i am a far better man than the ignorant gentiles
1226144 god forbid that i should glory in anything whatever except the cross
1226145 i have something to glory of i am a better man than paul
1226146 all must be right if i keep to my church
1226147 god forbid that i should glory in anything but the cross
1226148 became obedient unto death even the death of the cross
1226149 he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me cannot be my disciple
1226150 the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness
1226151 god forbid that i should glory save in the cross
1226152 i glory in nothing but christ crucified as the salvation of my soul
1226153 i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins
1226154 i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified
1226155 the life that i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
1226156 in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts
1226157 and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
1226158 hear o heavens and be astonished o earth a wonderful and a horrible thing is done
1226159 i have been a heathen i know how heathens think once a preacher came and began to explain to us that there was a god but we told him to return to the place from whence he came another preacher came and told us not to lie nor steal nor drink but we did not heed him at last another came into my hut one day and said i am come to you in the name of the lord of heaven and earth he sends to let you know that he will make you happy and deliver you from misery for this end he became a man gave his life a ransom and shed his blood for sinners i could not forget his words i told them to the other indians and an awakening begun among us i say therefore preach the sufferings and death of christ our saviour if you wish your words to gain entrance among the heathen
1226160 what do you think and feel about the cross of christ
1226161 a crucified saviour will never lay upon me anything that is not for my good there is a needs be it must be well
1226162 there is but one thing needful on a death bed and that is to feel ones arms round the cross
1226163 god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ
1226164 howsoever men when they sit at ease do vainly tickle their own hearts with the wanton conceit of i know not what proportionable correspondence between their merits and their rewards which in the trance of their high speculations they dream that god hath measured and laid up as it were in bundles for them we see notwithstanding by daily experience in a number even of them that when the hour of death approacheth when they secretly hear themselves summoned to appear and stand at the bar of that judge whose brightness causeth the eyes of angels themselves to dazzle all those idle imaginations do then begin to hide their faces
1226165 by the cross of christ the apostle understandeth the all sufficient expiatory and satisfactory sacrifice of christ upon the cross with the whole work of our redemption in the saving knowledge of whereof he professeth he will glory and boast
1226166 touching these words i do not find that any expositor either ancient or modern popish or protestant writing on this place doth expound the cross here mentioned of the sign of the cross but of the profession of faith in him that was hanged on the cross
1226167 this is rather to be understood of the cross which christ suffered for us than of that we suffer for him
1226168 christ crucified is the sum of the gospel and contains all the riches of it
1226169 if our faith stop in christs life and do not fasten upon his blood it will not be a justifying faith
1226170 paul determined to know nothing else but jesus christ and him crucified
1226171 in christs humiliation stands our exaltation in his weakness stands our strength in his ignominy our glory in his death our life
1226172 the eye of faith regards christ sitting on the summit of the cross as in a triumphal chariot the devil bound to the lowest part of the same cross and trodden under the feet of christ
1226173 the world we live in had fallen upon our heads had it not been upheld by the pillar of the cross had not christ stepped in and promised a satisfaction for the sin of man
1226174 a state of war only serves as an excuse for domestic tyranny

1226177 was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1226178 we are proud of the fact that alexander isaevich solzhenitsyn was our compatriot and contemporary
1226179 entire thorny path of his life will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless service to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1226180 time after time when confronted with conflicts of interest merrill lynch was consistent in that it placed its own interests ahead of its investor clients

1226191 the oakeshott independent team recognises we will be outspent by other campaigns by at least 20 to one and we recognise the seat of lyne has been a national party owned seat since it was first formed

1226196 i think it might be better than the first two
1226197 im really hopeful is it wishful thinking i think it has a lot more to offer by way of a movie going experience than the first two i think also its because seven years have gone by and another generation has come of age if you will

1226202 gee this hill sure is steep lets regrade the hill and then rebuild the city

1226204 europe has lost ground in terms of both production and patents the role of europe in invention is becoming secondary whereas fifteen years ago it was at least on par with the u s
1226205 in twenty years china and india will be the back offices and factories of the world the united states will be the innovator and europe will be the third world
1226206 was a bellwether for a lot of european entrepreneurs they suddenly had the sense im european and i can do this they were celebrating in the streets in estonia
1226207 in a few years people will think that paying for a telephone call is a very strange idea
1226208 its not as bad as japan but in europe failure is not celebrated its barely tolerated
1226209 in the u s people want their kids to grow up to be bill gates in france they want them to be minister of finance and they train them that way
1226210 you have countries that view innovation as a key part of their fabric
1226211 europe views tradition and lifestyle as their fabric in a hollywood movie you might have someone going on a computer searching the internet for clues in a european movie you will always have a great food scene
1226212 in the highly entrepreneurial cultures like korea china or israel the countries make it a matter of policy and now youre seeing chinese and indians educated in the united states going back to their home countries because theres so much opportunity you dont hear anyone say im going back to luxembourg for the opportunities

1226217 unhampered trade dovetailed with peace high tariffs trade barriers and unfair economic competition with war if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance of lasting the bretton woods agreements during the first three weeks of july 1944

1226241 this skylight over the bed is beautiful i really love it and theres a window behind my head too that opens up to the front of the house i love feeling like nature is right there
1226242 the work was very in depth and i think for the most part the group was convinced
1226243 if someone comes into a coastline or island group and starts up a fishery you could wipe out that population in a year or two
1226244 that would threaten regional extinction like what may be happening in the gulf of california
1226245 the way the schools here work is there are nine classes
1226246 if u work really hard so that u r in the smart person class they reward u with extra school
1226247 though i did lose a little flexibility in that thumb i can no longer make a right angle with my thumb and pointer finger and when i do a thumbs up the thumb does not go nearly as high as my right one does its almost a centimeter lower
1226248 at least u can make a backwards peace sign right
1226249 thats undeniable but which is worse being a wussy or being dead from a helmet that doesnt fit right
1226250 actually the pads would be good but i tried the helmet on and it seemed ok if u can wait for the pads great but i am not convinced u absolutely need them
1226251 right after i get pictures of the bike and the spiders
1226252 mom i need to get a shirt to wear for tonights show

1226258 a conglomeration of rockmelons and vanilla essence caramel and concentrated malts ready for a scrumptious desert
1226259 who would know if you performed one little miracle no one actually knows if the embies survived or not whos to say they didnt cant i have just one miracle its not like im asking for world power or harm to come to someone im asking for what everyone else seems to have the right

1226261 sou daqueles que acreditam firmemente que somente o parlamentarismo poderia p r fim a essas crises recorrentes de governabilidade que n s enfrentamos em todos os governos republicanos dentro do sistema presidencialista
1226262 a grande dificuldade que a reforma pol tica para que ela seja feita para que ela seja aprovada depende exatamente do congresso

1226264 a pouca considera o que dei ao congresso nacional foi um segundo grande erro
1226265 afastado da vida p blica h 15 anos e do congresso h 25 anos imagine o quanto n o terei que aprender para poder efetivamente estar com um instrumental necess rio para colaborar com a discuss o e o debate dos temas que interessam vida nacional meu desejo durante esses oito anos de mandato como senador da rep blica poder oferecer um projeto que pretendo apresentar em breve de uma reforma pol tica ampla profunda porque entendo que a reforma pol tica seja a m e de todas as reformas pretendo apresent la dentro de mais uns 20 dias ao congresso nacional e ao mesmo tempo aprender porque nesta casa se aprende muito
1226266 sou daqueles que acreditam firmemente que somente o parlamentarismo poderia p r fim a essas crises recorrentes de governabilidade que n s enfrentamos em todos os governos republicanos dentro do sistema presidencialista a partir da e dentro dessa proposta de mudan a do sistema de governo n s ter amos tamb m a quest o da fidelidade partid ria do financiamento p blico de campanha a quest o da n o obrigatoriedade do voto a quest o da obrigatoriedade dos partidos pol ticos terem dentro de seu organismo cursos de forma o de quadros partid rios para aqueles filiados que eventualmente venham a ser candidatos possam j ter uma base do que significa fazer pol tica ser pol tico e tamb m saber o que defende o seu partido qual o seu programa qual o seu ide rio e vale a introdu o do voto distrital para a melhor qualifica o da representa o parlamentar enfim s o v rios pontos que compor o esse projeto amplo de reforma pol tica que me referi

1226268 os erros foram em primeiro lugar um extremo voluntarismo de minha parte de acreditar que pudesse mudar o brasil do dia para a noite que poderia enfrentar a tudo e a todos e teria condi es de arrochar com as conseq ncias sem qualquer tipo de problemas a pouca considera o que dei ao congresso nacional foi um segundo grande erro enfim esses erros fizerem com que minha presid ncia ficasse fragilizada e redundasse no meu afastamento da presid ncia da rep blica a gente s aprende s ganha experi ncia com o sofrimento essa a grande escola que nos torna mais maduros com maior experi ncia e portanto seres humanos melhores se n s soubermos tirar proveito dos erros cometidos aprendendo as li es que esses erros e sofrimento nos traz

1226295 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1226296 the essential principles of our government form the bright constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation the wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment they should be the creed of our political faith the text of civic instruction the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace liberty and safety
1226297 i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
1226298 our particular principles of religion are a subject of accountability to our god alone i enquire after no mans and trouble none with mine nor is it given to us in this life to know whether yours or mine our friends or our foes are exactly the right

1226311 demi masa sesungguhnya manusia berada dalam kerugian kecuali orang orang yang beriman dan beramal shaleh dan orang orang yang saling menasehati dalam kebaikan dan saling menasehati dalam kesabaran
1226312 alif lam mim apakah manusia itu menyangka bahwa mereka dibiarkan untuk mengatakan kami telah beriman lalu mereka tidak diuji dan sungguh kami telah menguji orang orang sebelum mereka agar kami benar benar mengetahui siapakah di antara mereka yang benar benar beriman dan agar kami mengetahui siapakah di antara mereka yang berdusta
1226313 allah telah memberitakan di dalam ayat ini tentang kesempurnaan hikmah nya
1226314 orang yang paling keras cobaannya adalah para nabi kemudian setelah mereka kemudian setelah mereka
1226315 bersegeralah kalian menuju pengampunan rabb kalian dan kepada surga yang seluas langit dan bumi yang telah dijanjikan bagi orang orang yang bertakwa kepada allah
1226316 kemudian allah subhanahuwataala memerintahkan untuk bersegera menuju ampunan nya dan menuju surga seluas langit dan bumi lalu bagaimana dengan panjangnya yang telah dijanjikan oleh allah subhanahuwataala kepada orang orang yang bertakwa merekalah yang pantas menjadi penduduknya dan amalan ketakwaan itu akan menyampaikan kepada surga
1226317 perintah berlomba lomba dalam kebajikan merupakan perintah tambahan dalam melaksanakan kebajikan karena berlomba lomba mencakup mengerjakan perintah tersebut dengan sesempurna mungkin dan melaksanakannya dalam segala keadaan dan bersegera kepadanya barang siapa yang berlomba lomba dalam kebaikan di dunia maka dia akan menjadi orang pertama yang masuk ke dalam surga kelak pada hari kiamat dan merekalah orang yang paling tinggi kedudukannya
1226318 bersegeralah kalian menuju amal shaleh karena akan terjadi fitnah fitnah seperti potongan gelapnya malam di mana seorang mukmin bila berada di waktu pagi dalam keadaan beriman maka di sore harinya menjadi kafir dan jika di sore hari dia beriman maka di pagi harinya dia menjadi kafir dan dia melelang agamanya dengan harta benda dunia
1226319 hai orang orang yang beriman mintalah tolong kepada allah dengan penuh kesabaran dan shalat sesungguhnya allah bersama orang orang yang bersabar
1226320 sesungguhnya amal amal tergantung pada niat dan setiap orang akan mendapatkan sesuatu sesuai dengan niatnya
1226321 dan barang siapa yang melakukan satu amalan yang tidak ada perintahnya dari kami maka amalan tersebut tertolak
1226322 dia allah yang telah menciptakan mati dan hidup untuk menguji kalian siapakah yang paling bagus amalannya
1226323 kalau aku jadi kamu aku akan berpikir positif berterima kasih karena dia mengirimkan sms sms itu siapa tahu dia dikirim allah untuk menasehatimu

1226326 tidak apa apa ini hp kakak saya yang bekerja di perusahaan operator gsm dia mendapat subsidi untuk pribadi dua ratus lima puluh ribu sebulan dan dia berikan pada saya sebagai sumbangan ke anak anak jalanan itu katanya sudah ya wassalaamualaikum
1226327 gi sudahlah mama mengijinkan kok kalo kamu ikutan ngeronda malam ini besok kan libur sekolah
1226328 tapi ma ogi males kalo harus bergabung dengan bapak bapak dan pemuda yang biasa ngeronda itu
1226329 tapi gi mending ikut aja deh soalnya mama malu nanti sama pak rt
1226330 oke deh tapi gimana kalo nanti anak semata wayangmu pulang tinggal nama
1226331 bener ma ogi nggak bohong mama kan udah denger kalo maling sekarang lebih nekat minggu kemarin di kampung sebelah ada orang yang kecurian eh begitu malingnya ketahuan terus diteriakkin malah balik menyerang dikejar oleh empat orang pun yang ngejarnya malah balik lagi tahu nggak kenapa ma malingnya cuma dua orang tapi yang satu bawa samurai dan satunya lagi bawa pistol coba mana bisa melawan kita
1226332 tapi kan kalo rame rame maling juga mikir mikir lagi gi
1226333 itu kalo warganya mau semua turun lha kalo cuma lima orang atau sepuluh orang masih ngeri juga ma
1226334 tapi masak kita mau ngalah sih gi kalo kita pada takut maling makin seneng aja untuk beroperasi
1226335 ogi menyayangkan banget kenapa polisi cuma jaga jaga di kantornya aja nerima laporan nggak keliling ke setiap kampung polisi kan punya senjata maling takut tuh ma kalo ngelihat polisi
1226336 aduh mamaku sayang bukan maksud ogi membikin ruwet masalah tapi ogi cuma ngasih wacana aja bahwa kemanan itu tanggung jawab pemerintah bukan warga
1226337 betul kita nggak bisa sepenuhnya mengandalkan sama pemerintah tapi kan tanggung jawab utama adalah pemerintah buat apa ada polisi tul nggak ma
1226338 wah sejak kapan nih anak mama bisa ngoceh soal politik
1226339 he he he ngoceh soal politik bukan monopoli politikus aja ma warga biasa juga bisa dan dituntut untuk mikirin umat ini itu juga namanya berpolitik ma
1226340 mama ngerti kok gi urusan ini memang tanggung jawab pemerintah tapi dalam kondisi seperti ini kita ngalah dulu deh gi
1226341 nah coba pengen tahu nih komentar mas bagus soal ini biasanya doi paling kenceng dan tajam analisanya kalo berkomentar
1226342 tingkat kejahatan yang terus meroket tajam sementara kinerja kepolisian yang kendor semakin membuat masyarakat tak percaya lagi dengan aparat penegak hukum tersebut
1226343 kira kira sepuluh orang gi satpam bertiga jadi tiga belas
1226344 maling harus dikasih pelajaran biar tahu rasa dan biar maling lain kapok untuk berbuat yang sama
1226345 ya mungkin saja akan tertangkap dan kita hakimi ramai ramai
1226346 kalo sudah ketangkep mending kita serahkan saja kepada polisi aman
1226347 percuma dik polisi kerjaannya molor melulu malah ada juga yang udah ketangkep malah dibebaskan kembali coba siapa nyang kagak kesel jadi lebih baik selesaikan dengan cara kita sendiri
1226348 bapak bapak semuanya tenang dan sabar kita nggak boleh gegabah bertindak
1226349 omong kosong kamu mau kalo ini terus kejadian dibiarin maling tambah ngelunjak
1226350 betul pak kita juga kesal kita juga kecewa sebab di negeri ini makin banyak saja kejahatan sementara hukum tak pernah ditegakkan tapi tentunya kita juga nggak bisa main hakim sendiri pak
1226351 bukan saatnya untuk berkhotbah di sini percuma ayo kawan kawan kita bakar saja manusia keparat ini
1226352 tapi sebentar biar nggak penasaran gue pengen tahu dulu siapa manusia bertopeng ini manusia keparat

1226355 you dont have to perfect at writing 100 of the time add variations to your writing include a sentence fragment every once in a while readers typically wont call it out and it still gets your point across
1226356 a writer is anyone who creates written work although the word more usually designates those who write creatively or professionally or those who have written in many different forms
1226357 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomisation of the query id and the source port essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response
1226358 however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my os x 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomise the source port
1226359 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1226360 apple might have fixed some of the more important parts for servers but is far from done yet as all the clients linked against a dns client library still need to get the workaround for the protocol weakness
1226361 in these cases the network device performing pat port address translation uses a predictable source port allocation policy such as incremental allocation when performing the layer 4 rewrite operation that is necessary for pat

1226408 without a doubt worst album to date written mar 15 08 updated mar 19 08
1226409 on krs myspace page in april and then in november i heard
1226410 after the producer bam beats leaked it to the internet
1226411 he also addressed the fact that the tracks were not relatively new
1226412 another thing that strikes me as weird is the title of the record
1226413 unfortunately this release is far below the standards of any previous bdp krs release
1226414 krs maintains that he will never change he will always be the teacher speaking on social issues uplifting his community and speaking on prominent black figures like martin luther king jr malcom x marcus garvey and such
1226415 is the umpteenth krs track in which every line ends with the same word or phrase
1226416 from his 1995 self titled album as he tries to twist a story into the mix but the story simply isnt interesting and neither is the production
1226417 are basically the same they both talk about the importance of love in everyday life and hip hop but they still have their differences
1226418 tries a african tribal thing that just doesnt work and it doesnt help that the subject matter for all these songs have been covered by krs on previous records as ive said before theres just no other way to say it most of the songs on this album are wack as hell
1226419 which i mentioned as one of the first tracks i heard from this record back in 06
1226420 krs shines here lyrically schooling the young rap cats like hes known to do what makes this track so great is that you can feel his seething anger as he throws line after hard hittin line at these wack rappers
1226421 which finds krs speaking on the state of hip hop over a mellow backdrop
1226422 while the song itself is great and works it would be so much more believeable if it wasnt surrounded by all that other sh itty material
1226423 i was a collector and thats how i got into the business
1226424 we renew that agreement every year because it allows thousands of people to see the coin
1226425 so many great coins get tucked away for the enjoyment of the collector
1226426 george washington was president and could have handled the coin alexander hamilton was head of the banking system
1226427 i didnt feel comfortable going out on a limb i didnt see it as a wise business decision
1226428 its fun to have them for a while but as passionate as i am to own these things im just as passionate about selling them at the end of the day it is still a business
1226429 all reputable have concluded that our country has but a tiny bit of oil reserves that exploitation is not

1226444 we have collected some old photographs of the person and are trying to find him he was in alipore central jail in 2000 and there is every possibility that he has been shifted to some other prison
1226445 we have informed all the city jails about the incident and we are trying our best to find the person but it is impossible to say how long it will take
1226446 prisoners of war are no more prisoners but how this man is still in jail is a mystery
1226447 the state prison authorities have shown a positive response towards our appeal they are taking all possible steps to trace this man and send him back to his family members
1226448 hopefully we will be able to send him back soon

1226456 theres always a gray area about what caused what first

1226459 have a list of pet friendly hotels veterinary clinics and boarding facilities in or around the town your are evacuating to
1226460 a lot of animals that died during rita were cases of overheating because of power outages not because of the storm
1226461 cats are more attached to their territory than to their owner
1226462 its important to keep them comfortable while they are contained for long periods of time
1226463 i dont see where its going to make a difference
1226464 it still gives people plenty of time to get off work get a bite to eat and still get there
1226465 theres no rhyme or reason why were starting at 7 30 other than because its not like we cant get officials here by then everyones ready to go lots of kids dont go home before games its just another half hour theyre waiting

1226470 youve got an economic slowdown and markets are slowly coming to terms with it some of the speculation that was looking for safe harbour in commodities is starting to unwind
1226471 our longer term view is still for a structural uptrend because we dont see the demand easing at all and we still see some supply side constraints
1226472 we need to look for new ways that people can protect themselves
1226473 clearly this is one of the most promising things we have in the pipeline right now
1226474 we dont know if this is going to work or not but we must get it on the agenda
1226475 we must be prepared for the answers we do get
1226476 the logical extension is to think about it for prevention of sexual or injection drug transmission
1226477 the only thing that held us back is we didnt have any drugs amenable to that we need very low side effects and a high barrier to development of resistance
1226478 it wasnt until truvada came down the pipe that we had the pills to test it
1226479 but animals are not people so we dont know if it will work until we conduct clinical trials
1226480 if the efficacy is at that level or higher intervention would be cost effective in very high risk populations
1226481 we cannot wait for the study results to begin to prepare for the optimal use and delivery of prep
1226482 instead we should look ahead to consider all the possible outcomes of the trials and make real plans for making prep available to those who can benefit from it as quickly and as safely as possible if it is proven effective
1226483 in australia and probably globally the carbon carrying capacity of natural forests is underestimated and therefore misrepresented in economic valuations and in policy options
1226484 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1226485 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1226486 we need to make sure that emissions trading schemes do not lead to perverse outcomes

1226540 acci considers moderation in wage and non wage growth as well as declining business confidence and profit growth reduce the possibility of a wage price inflation spiral despite headline inflation hitting a 13 year high of 4 5 per cent in the year to june mr evans said
1226541 given the notable slowing in growth acci considers that an interest rate cut should be considered as early as possible

1226646 today on the open spot market a gigabyte of mlc nand flash memory is about one third the price of a gigabyte of slc nand therefore a 64gb c200 laptop drive will be about one third the price of a 64gb p200 enterprise drive
1226647 we are convinced that on the very low end and on the very high end ssd will penetrate the notebook netbook markets but the mainstream notebook will remain hdd for the foreseeable future
1226648 progress in general on ssd adoption has been slower then we would of all preferred or predicted and the truth is wider adoption for ssd will probably take a bit longer
1226649 ssds age gracefully they degrade gracefully we can predict this based on your usage model how much longer that drive will last
1226650 typical raw nand write endurance is ten thousand cycles for mlc while slc is typically a hundred thousand cycles
1226651 the typical notebook user only writes two to four gigabytes per day even if you look at 40 or 60 gigabytes a day you still dont need the 10 000 cycles of mlc in five years
1226652 one of the things that ssd manufacturers have been slow to learn is that you cant just take a compact flash controller throw some nand on there and call it an ssd
1226653 the application of storing data on a notebook and certainly on the enterprise is far different than that controller was designed to support
1226654 weve got a lot of processing power in this controller weve got a very large dram buffer attached to this controller so having that dram buffer both allows us to increase the performance of the drive in addition to minimizing the wear

1226658 a successful immunotherapeutic hiv vaccine would give patients and doctors enormous advantages over current treatments both in developed and developing countries even if this vaccine is not the final answer it could help the march towards a successful immunotherapeutic hiv vaccine
1226659 this is the largest current therapeutic vaccine trial in the world involving 345 patients this trial will establish a solid foundation for hiv immune therapies if we can maintain immunogenicity during drug free periods

1226921 theres a lot of people saying will they wont they has it failed has it succeeded
1226922 it was always a trial and a trial is by its nature a trial to see whether it works to see whether its succeeded to see whether its changed behaviours

1226932 with regard to the inflation outlook acci considers moderation in wage and non wage growth as well as declining business confidence and profit growth reduce the possibility of a wage price inflationary spiral despite the headline inflation hitting a 13 year high of 4 5 percent in the year to june given the notable slowing in growth acci considers that an interest rate cut should be considered as early as possible
1226933 the results recorded over the past quarter show the global liquidity crisis is clearly impacting australian business
1226934 however it is encouraging to see some buoyancy from those businesses operating outside of the domestic market exporters continue to take advantage of high commodity prices and export sales maintain steady growth underlining the significance of their contribution to the overall economy
1226935 the complexities of planning applications which provide the opportunity for coles and woolworths to game the planning system to delay or prevent potential competitors entering local areas
1226936 i believe that our action plan combined with the broader reforms that are already in train to further strengthen competition policy such as the amendments to the misuse of market power provision and the criminalisation of serious cartel conduct will ensure that the grocery market remains competitive

1226939 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1226940 we are spending all of this time on a parliamentary tactic when nothing less is at stake than the planet the air we breathe our children breathe
1226941 this is the moment when we must renew our resolve to rout the terrorists who threaten our security in afghanistan
1226942 no one welcomes war i recognize the enormous difficulties in afghanistan
1226943 but my country and yours have a stake in seeing that natos first mission beyond europes borders is a success for the people of afghanistan and for our shared security the work must be done
1226944 rout the terrorists and the traffickers who sell drugs on your streets
1226945 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
1226946 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it this threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it if we could create nato to face down the soviet union we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in madrid and amman in london and bali in washington and new york
1226947 america cannot do this alone the afghan people need our troops and your troops our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al qaida
1226948 the poverty and violence in somalia breeds the terror of tomorrow
1226949 in europe the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common
1226950 america is part of what has gone wrong in our world
1226951 the genocide in darfur shames the conscience of us all
1226952 europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world
1226953 that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another
1226954 the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
1226955 this is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons this is the moment to begin the work of seeking the peace of a world without nuclear weapons

1226959 were already spending the money to build a brilliant new international stadium and a multi purpose sports facility
1226960 were already building a replacement for this facility here with basketball capacity a netball centre and a rugby centre
1226961 if john coates believes its possible then i think we can make a very serious play for this
1226962 i think people understand that these bids are very competitive wed be up against very big players internationally
1226963 but frankly in 15 to 20 years time i think well be more than up for it
1226964 what is in australias favour is that the sydney games were very successful
1226965 whats not in our favour is that its now going to cost so much more to organise
1226966 were already spending the money to build a brilliant new international stadium and a multi purpose sports facility
1226967 how i can relive the horror of high school for 103 and
1226968 a green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head the green earflaps full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once full pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and at their corners sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs
1226969 why do i do this why do i continue blogging
1226970 we want to buy a house in salem and we were hoping you could help us with that
1226971 sometimes i wonder if i put too much personality into my writing
1226972 hell want to play tonight and he may be able to
1226973 but what i dont want to do is do something like this playing that is for the benefit of the rest of the year and have him run himself right back into the ground in the fifth inning
1226974 the doctors said youre really not going to make it worse
1226975 so he played sunday and got the shot this morning
1226976 ive got the leadoff helmet i carry it with me everyone once in a while on a trip in case i need it
1226977 i dont think too much about lineups and positions and stuff i know tito got strapped a little bit and sometimes you need somebody to fill certain roles and i dont mind doing it at all the only time its a major factor is to start a game
1226978 my mind set is just one way trying to get on base and do things like that no matter where im at in the lineup so i think it works out pretty well
1226979 i dont need to be recognized but this is something nice something to be celebrated whatever
1226980 but i dont need an award to know how far ive come and know how far ive progressed
1226981 my last at bat it kind of pulled back a little bit
1226982 you feel that click and you get a little concerned about it
1226983 the main thing is to make sure my hand feels fine
1226984 i dont want to be thinking about my hand and my timing its too much
1226985 i havent seen it when i get out of here im going to look for the range shortly after that hopefully ill get to the first tee and play some holes
1226986 its closer to home than it was two weeks ago
1226987 hopefully the couple of games ive been in this year will help out
1226988 its just a matter of getting a little bit of experience under my belt playing in one of the group games really helped
1226989 i tried to have a good week of training and tried to prepare the same way i did throughout college and during my short professional career
1226990 im just trying to make sure that i am physically and mentally ready i think i am
1226991 i am rebel but i buy my image from a mall
1226992 hang power clean is from the hang to quarter squat
1226993 its in the reports you can read about it in the media reports
1226994 i went grabbed the sergeant out of the shotgun seat pulled him out
1226995 we checked him over his leg was injured we then carried him away behind a second armored humvee because the ammunition from the first armored humvee was cooking off and firing in all directions
1226996 i got here this morning to play and there wasnt a soul out here
1226997 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course
1226998 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1226999 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts that certainly is a golf course ive got a lot of good memories around
1227000 it was kind of out of the blue because i hadnt talked to him too much just a couple of times since hed left for atlanta
1227001 he just wanted to wish me luck because he knew camp was starting just some words of encouragement
1227002 ive been asked questions constantly about the experience factor and replacing matt ryan and im just numb to it right now
1227003 i feel that im ready i feel that i have the ability to play and it really doesnt come into my mind that i havent played the last three years to a quarterback practice is just about the same as a game
1227004 i dont really feel like its that big of a deal but well see when the games come the biggest factor will be the fans and the noise and how you deal with the gametime situation but i feel thats something thats instinctive and ill be able to improve exponentially after the first game on
1227005 to be a leader and to be the quarterback of the team you cant be the most liked guy out there
1227006 everyones different but people are generally going to need someone to prod them along and its the ability to know when and where to pick your battles and which guys you need to encourage and which guys you really need to get on
1227007 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1227008 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1227009 we are at 80 and if we make any roster moves well let you know as soon as we can
1227010 we are where we are right now if anything changes well let you know
1227011 she made her choice and that was up to her
1227012 were here to represent our country we have a nice rivalry with russia with or without her its always been a battle whether shes here or not well always bring our best
1227013 its not an issue anymore were playing against russia now and its 12 people
1227014 anyone who puts that uniform on is our opposition there is no individual that we look at or highlight
1227015 once the ball went up it was just another basketball game
1227016 its all coming down to this year and what happens
1227017 obviously i cant control everything that happens but the things i can control i wanted to take into my own hands and do everything to the best of my ability to try and reach my goal
1227018 i only have one opportunity left so i might as well make the best of it if i do everything i could do and i dont make it i can live with that but if i wasnt doing everything i needed to do to get to the next level then thats my fault and i wouldnt be able to live with that
1227019 right now the biggest thing for me is staying healthy
1227020 after two years of being injured you realize how important taking care of your body is before that playing football was something i took for granted and enjoyed but after not playing fully healthy for two years and taking a year off and watching my team accomplish great things it made me more hungry
1227021 but everybody talks about how good our defense can be and weve got to prove it week in and week out
1227022 thats the starting point but whatever is im going to have my best five out there
1227023 im making some combinations clif at left guard and lapham played right tackle and i just want to create some more depth by letting them get to know more than one position
1227024 i just to get some more speed back there and see what he can do
1227025 no matter what im doing if its a block a pass route or running you have to finish it everything is about finishing
1227026 we are all starting from scratch and laurence is working on everything and finishing his plays
1227027 whatever it is that finishing is important and there are a lot of things we are working on at this point
1227028 that the playoffs gave me a little bit more confidence in myself
1227029 once i put my mind to it i know i can be a good back in the nfl its just a point of being patient and just going out and doing what i do best im almost there i wish i was a little bit further but i cant complain because im a lot further than i was last year im not quite there yet but im not far away from it
1227030 theres competition wherever you go and at every position we have out here
1227031 he came out of the middle of the field and just clocked me
1227032 we were getting blown out and i tried to go back in the game
1227033 he told me ive got two things to tell you
1227034 one if im ever in a fight im picking you because youre one tough son of a gun
1227035 i was never totally unconscious i think the nfl ended up fining him 7 500 or 15 000 i wish i could have put that in my pocket
1227036 our qb threw me a slant in the second hole and roshard hit me so hard i went spinning around
1227037 he ended up having to leave the game so that was my little victory at least i stayed in the game but i was spinning i wanted to go out too
1227038 your stomach doesnt churn when you come to the ballpark what are you going to do walk him pitch to him id be lying if i didnt tell you that its the truth youd have to think for the other managers it was the same he was that dominant i havent seen barry i havent read about him
1227039 well have tests just so we can rule out everything it kind of grabbed and it was a little bit tighter in the fifth inning
1227040 he said he felt ok but ive got to hear that he feels great
1227041 i knew it was gone right when it came off the bat he threw a fastball and i put a good swing on it
1227042 it was big because of the way that we did it against the team we did it against factoring in the circumstances
1227043 the more the better for an old guy like me
1227044 it looks better than it was when i was here a few months ago but to be honest for us the smog actually helps
1227045 i can actually see those little orange disks a lot better in the sky than with a perfect white background
1227046 so as many cars as they want to get on the road the day i compete id be quite happy about
1227047 weve been aware of this matter for a very long time
1227048 were checking the air quality readings all the time and were determined to get on with the job
1227049 we havent had any athletes that have expressed any desire to go home its not a matter of concern to the athletes weve done this matter until were blue in the face so to speak
1227050 restlessly probing the deep litter of the forest to gather food

1227052 what the fuck is she doing that girl is italian
1227053 pretty soon i dont know ill probably have to move out of my house to make room for all the romanians and morrocans
1227054 if someone wants to come in my house they have to respect my culture and my people instead these romanians come here and they act like this is their house and it is embarrassing
1227055 it is a society that has changed very rapidly the shame the fear
1227056 is that we have a political class that instead of managing this change are pandering to voters and the people who dont understand the problem say bravo it is a kind of search for votes this is propaganda
1227057 i think by now they are back in italy it was not an effective decision
1227058 extreme right groups are taking this opportunity to raise a racist culture and they are trying to organise themselves to try and find romanians and give the city a kind of false revenge
1227059 in every country young people hope here in italy there is no hope anymore your mom keeps you home nice and softly and you stay there and you dont fight and if you dont fight it is impossible to take power from anybody
1227060 we cant imagine in italy that a 30 year old opens a business in a garage
1227061 having been told i tend to follow my heart more often than my head i feel as though it is the ideal setting to pursue my practical professional goals in conjunction with my tendency for romanticism
1227062 well you are american you want to be like madonna im happy being me being average
1227063 it is the best job in the ioc because you have the honour to represent the voice of the athlete i think frankie will take the athletes commission to the next level hes a perfect fit for the role
1227064 we will have to reflect with calmness and tranquility on the future of the olympic torch relay
1227065 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1227066 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1227067 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1227068 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1227069 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1227070 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
1227071 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organized
1227072 cadel will be flying in tomorrow and the news is that hell definitely be riding in the road race
1227073 and depending on how he goes after that he may ride in the time trial but that wont be decided until after the road race
1227074 we were devastated after athens and resolved to make whatever changes were necessary to address any shortcomings
1227075 our plan has been driven very much by the athens experience and not wishing to repeat it
1227076 by the end of august we will know how successful we have been in our approach
1227077 athletes from overseas spent a lot of time in australia in the build up to 2000 this meant we didnt have to travel to the extent that we would normally leading to savings that could be spent in other areas
1227078 preparations for the 2004 olympics in europe were expensive and were made more so because of inflation and the relative strength of the dollar against european currencies at the time
1227079 in an expensive equipment based sport this had a significant impact on all areas of our program and the ability of our athletes to properly prepare all this coupled with the benefits of the familiarity of a home games in 2000 certainly had an impact in 2004
1227080 for some reason we play really well against these guys
1227081 i was more relaxed i had a different feeling on the mound
1227082 for some reason we play really well against these guys
1227083 and when cliff lee is on the mound you just follow his lead
1227084 i see a guy pitching with a lot of confidence
1227085 were still playing some great baseball especially here at home not much you can do when a guy is pitching the way he is though
1227086 we seem to have a lot of trouble against this team myself included
1227087 they didnt mention that in the 2am infomercial i watched
1227088 so do i get a bigger discount if we go out for a drink

1227094 i dont want them crushing when you put them on your seat
1227095 oh my god mary that is so cool i cant believe that happened to you at work today wow tell me about him again
1227096 i started pretty well and i am focused on this tournament

1227114 if in order to get a comprehensive energy policy passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1227115 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
1227116 the windfall profits tax is back with barack obama stumping again to apply it to a handful of big oil companies
1227117 what constitutes an abnormal profit is entirely arbitrary a windfall is nothing more than a profit earned by a business that some politician dislikes and a tax on that profit is merely a form of politically motivated expropriation

1227126 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
1227127 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1227128 inflation in australia has been high over the past year in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand
1227129 this was evident again in the most recent cpi data in these circumstances the board has been seeking to restrain demand in order to reduce inflation over time
1227130 we believe that it is important to provide incentives for our high performing leaders
1227131 if you were being sensible you would put an immediate moratorium on all old growth logging all around the country because its clear the carbon stocks are so much higher than anyone has previously analysed before
1227132 the last thing you would do would be to log old growth forests in tasmania or victoria
1227133 we seem rather unfair to other sectors who are you know having a close scrutiny of emissions profiles from you know the energy sector and coal and transport and we really should be doing the same for all sectors

1227135 the banks forecast remains that inflation will fall below three per cent during 2010
1227136 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
1227137 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1227138 the evidence is that the tightening in financial conditions in conjunction with other factors including rising fuel costs and lower asset values has restrained demand
1227139 indicators of household spending have continued to record subdued outcomes over recent months and credit expansion to both households and businesses has slowed significantly
1227140 at the same time high prices of oil and a range of other commodities have added to global inflationary risks
1227141 they are also dampening growth in a number of countries
1227142 given the opposing forces at work considerable uncertainty has surrounded the outlook for demand and inflation
1227143 inflation is likely to remain relatively high in the short term with the cpi affected by high global oil prices
1227144 looking further ahead inflation in both cpi and underlying terms is likely to decline over time given the outlook for demand provided wages growth remains moderate
1227145 we closed out all of our hedges on the basis that we had an optimistic view of the gold price

1227149 this industry is dependent on new discoveries and new mines coming on stream and at the moment its not happening
1227150 its very very tough in places like south africa and australia to bring costs down because youre fighting a losing battle given the maturity of the belt that youre mining
1227151 without wanting to just preach our story i think youve got to go to new jurisdictions
1227152 and thats challenging as well because youve got to find those jurisdictions that have geological potential and manageable political risk
1227153 and thats where we think china has been under recognised

1227157 it is not true that when the heart is full the eyes necessarily overflow some people can never manage it especially in our century which in spite of all the suffering and sorrow will surely be known to posterity as the tearless century these people wanted to talk to unburden themselves but they couldnt seem to get started despite all their efforts they left the essential unsaid talked around it

1227190 a similar percentage increase is expected for the full year

1227222 he has been waiting a very long time and he is happy this day is finally here
1227223 everyone understood those crimes were all done by the same person
1227224 the police were in the house searching it my belongings were taken away my computer and my diary i felt really violated
1227225 in hindsight i should not have crossed that boundary and i guess she might have got the wrong impression i was suffering from depression at the time and that affected my thinking
1227226 i accept i shouldnt have done it but i never expected anything like this i thought id be taken to one side and told to sort it out
1227227 it was 8am and i was still in my pyjamas when the police turned up they took me away and questioned me although by the second time i was questioned i got the feeling they knew there wasnt much in it
1227228 but the waiting has been horrendous its been a year of worsening fear
1227229 i lost my old house i felt like i was being watched all they time you know you havent done anything but i was scared to go out
1227230 its torn my family apart there was never any truth in it but youre never sure how its going to end
1227231 now for my daughters sake ive got to just get my life back on track hopefully now we can all move on
1227232 the toughest 6 inches in the game of golf is between a players ears
1227233 at 10 22 p m friday evening we got a call that every parent dreads this is the hospital we have a patient here named paul rieth we want you to come yes call your family to come
1227234 we give thanks to god that paul survived the night everything weve heard from the officers and staff since leads us to think that they didnt know if paul would live through the night gods hand was on him and it is a miracle that he is alive he is still critical but stable
1227235 we give thanks to god that paul is a believer and that he has a tender heart and a gentle spirit he is a deep and serious thinker and has a heart to help people
1227236 as we come face to face with the reality of his accident we find comfort and hope in the lord we know that god is hearing the thousands of prayers on pauls behalf we have peace that god is watching over him and trust the lord for the outcome
1227237 our hearts go out to the many of you who are going through serious trials and situations we are not without hope it is in times such as these that we come face to face with the things that are important
1227238 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house they confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1227239 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements
1227240 upon release one of the christians permanently departed the country the others thinking that their ordeal was over went back to their daily lives and work but soon received letters demanding that they leave the country immediately
1227241 the decision to deport them runs contrary to recent attempts to portray the kingdom as a beacon of reconciliation among christians muslims jews and others three weeks ago saudi arabia hosted an interfaith conference in madrid spain during the conference that took place from july 16 19 king abdullah of saudi arabia called for reconciliation among various religions
1227242 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1227243 im looking forward to saturday just because were going to get a chance to get out there and play
1227244 i say be on the field and into it and everything
1227245 you get a chance to really see where you are and see how youre going to start out this year
1227246 i did make it clear to the team that i wouldnt be coming back this season after the olympics
1227247 i want them to be able to get a team together and didnt want to leave any doors open
1227248 i wanted to make sure they had their opportunity to get a full strength team and not wait for anyone
1227249 its disappointing but it gave me the opportunity to prepare for this major event
1227250 you want her dont you you so want her shes hot isnt she

1227257 yes but it also makes you look like a pricey hooker so things kinda balance out
1227258 if i answer that question then the terrorists have won
1227259 okay listen whats important is that you not focus in a negative way on the comparison i am about to make
1227260 let me jog around to your front and take a look
1227261 no honey but just to be safe steer clear of one legged sea captains
1227262 previously confirmed to espn that he had spoken with federal authorities but insisted he has done nothing wrong and that fbi agents had asked him nothing about his own activities

1227266 the last time hunger was so deep and so widespread in parts of the country was in the late 1990s
1227267 i want to help myself to use my bare hands
1227268 china has the resources and capacity to manage this on its own
1227269 its an important signal by the chinese government to welcome international support in the relief and recovery effort
1227270 we legitimize the use of force and may tempt the israelis
1227271 i dont want the public to believe a preemptive attack can be justified
1227272 convinces iran it is being threatened and maybe it ought to have a nuclear weapon
1227273 it brings the u s solidly in with the europeans and the russians
1227274 the president has met with dissidents regularly over the last seven years and i expect that he will continue to do so but the schedule hasnt been set yet for the trip
1227275 has worsened because of the olympics and the administration has not been forceful in addressing the situation
1227276 to truly succeed in designing basketball betting architecture one must have a good classical background but also know some of the most cutting edge techniques of today
1227277 to target the most critical points related to the olympics
1227278 we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed
1227279 not capable of launching different attacks in different cities in china i think they just wanted to increase their influence and attract more funding by claiming responsibility
1227280 china has invested very significantly in protecting the olympic venues
1227281 no terrorist group can mount large scale attacks in beijing during this period but medium to small attacks are possible
1227282 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai
1227283 you will find folks who will say there is significant penetration of the isi by terrorist elements and thats a serious concern
1227284 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom
1227285 this is not going to be a meeting that produces specific outcomes
1227286 its really a meeting to review where the six party process is at the moment
1227287 ecuador has a growing incidence of cases of hiv aids with a rate of 17 3 per 100 thousand people guayaquil has one of the highest infection rates in the country and the homosexual community is heavily impacted there are now 80 000 infections of hiv aids in ecuador with 806 new infections in men this year and 546 in women 315 men have been newly diagnosed with aids and 113 women have been newly diagnosed this is information newly published by onusida july 30 2008 as in many countries stigma and discrimination still lead to poverty and hopelessness for people living with hiv aids yet stigma discrimination and poverty the three conditions that aid and abet the pandemic are very prevalent
1227288 my son daniel shared his testimony for the first time ever on this trip and i was very proud of him
1227289 he shared that he had gotten into trouble because of all his anger but through his relationship with jesus he had had a door opened for inner healing it was a very moving testimony his wife becky shared about stigma and discrimination and how destructive it is she is preparing to start graduate school in social work in moscow idaho in september 2008 this trip was a wonderful pre graduate experience for her

1227291 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1227292 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1227293 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1227294 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1227295 i mean this is a closed society in many ways
1227296 the internet provides interesting opportunities for people to express themselves sometimes its open sometimes the filters are there ive talked to the evangelicals who go there who feel like the underground church movement has gotten a few steps forward a step and a half back its really hard to tell
1227297 a sanctuary to successive waves of immigrants searching for home that search rather than the bricks and mortar of the street is at the heart of the story
1227298 what im hearing is a lot of talk about this man behind the curtain what im not hearing is personal responsibility
1227299 whos up for a field trip to mr spriggs bbq
1227300 its alwaaays tender alwaaeaeaeaaays tenderrrrrrrr meat falls off the bohohohohoooone
1227301 ill tell you what i dont want to work through in group the time i murdered that witch and buried her body under a house in kansas back in 1939
1227302 what im hearing is a lot of talk about this man behind the curtain what im not hearing is personal responsibility
1227303 mrs desmond was fined for defrauding the federal government of one cent the difference in the amusement tax on an upstairs ticket of two cents and a downstairs ticket of three cents
1227304 ill use my heat vision to melt this crooks gun barrel
1227305 my girlfriend lois lane sure is happy because of the flowers im giving her
1227306 there is a certain grim white humor in the fact that the black marches and demonstrations of the 1960s reached artistic fulfillment
1227307 provocative and ultimately insidious reincarnations of all the sapphires and studds of yesteryear
1227308 its like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how i keep from going under
1227309 what we used for melody was implied melody and what we used for music was sounds beats scratches stuff played backward nothing pretty or sweet
1227310 teach listeners something about the lives of the people who create them and remind them that these people exist
1227311 mainstream america can look at me and say thats the mentality of a young man from the hood
1227312 university of pennsylvania black studies professor michael eric dyson has written a book length paean to shakur praising him for
1227313 artistically exploring the attractions and limits of black moral and social subcultures
1227314 hip hop can be used as a bridge linking the seemingly vast span between the streets and the world of academics
1227315 the message of sweetback is that if you can get it together and stand up to the man you can win
1227316 the coolest stuff about american culture be it language dress or attitude comes from the underclass always has and always will
1227317 tem duas mulheres dentro da central e s est o deixando as viaturas sairem em casos de emerg ncia com v tima porque s o casoso em que necess rios salvar vidas
1227318 tivemos uma chamada e tivemos que deslocar duas viaturas para fora da cidade e momentaneamente a cidade ficou descoberta
1227319 i mean im just going to go out and keep playing and competing and hopefully by the time the season starts ill still have a starting job
1227320 i went to shippensburg knowing i had to play hard and lift weights
1227321 when he first came here we knew he had talent
1227322 he was so athletic and had a ton of potential
1227323 he could do things that made your eyes light up
1227324 the coaches at shippensburg taught me how to work hard
1227325 they knew i had a chance to go to the nfl and that i wanted to go to the nfl but they let me know that coming from a small school it was going to be hard and that people were going to look over me and doubt me
1227326 at first they would say stuff like shippensburg whats that
1227327 but i understand why and i think i am doing a good job of proving them wrong
1227328 i think they know i can play here and i mean i dont have anything against big schools so its nothing they can joke on me all they want its cool
1227329 i wanted to see how that was going to go down
1227330 salvation means that god writes his name on your head your hand your heart he makes his name yours by making you his
1227331 that i will set up thy seed after thee who shall be of thy sons
1227332 this passage does not state categorically it will be solomon but one of the sons of david therefore why not through the lineage of nathan the other son of david and bathsheba through not only double fulfillment but possibly also single fulfillment what do you think
1227333 the program basically gives an opportunity to those seeking an organized way to self deport
1227334 i am officially in the business of taking care of people
1227335 i hve to have a cigarette when im insert activity
1227336 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
1227337 i came to realise how much we take at face value
1227338 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
1227339 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
1227340 obviously it isnt perfectly flat thanks to geological phenomena like hills and valleys it is around 24 900 miles in diameter
1227341 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
1227342 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
1227343 the sophistication of this attack and the kind of material that was used the specific targeting everything has the hallmarks of a particular agency that has conducted similar attacks inside afghanistan we have sufficient evidence to say that
1227344 the project was designed outside afghanistan it was exported to afghanistan
1227345 we certainly are concerned that there is complicity at some level on the pakistan side that allows the freedom of movement and freedom of maneuver
1227346 yes there was a little bit of an apology from the united states but i think that its pretty minor
1227347 were working on the dates and as soon as we have them set well let people know
1227348 we have seen an ever more obvious attempt to take the council beyond its prerogative
1227349 we consider such action to be illegitimate and dangerous we intend to continue countering this trend
1227350 china and russia have stood with mugabe against the people of zimbabwe
1227351 financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for violence
1227352 the russian performance here today raises questions about its reliability as a g 8 partner
1227353 the political option should take precedence over the punitive option
1227354 i had this nice large house with two extra rooms
1227355 i wondered is it safe to have strangers coming and going out of your house i was worried about drugs hippies and terrorists but the experience has been enriching
1227356 where is the land for more hotels in the city it takes a very long time and a lot of money to build hotels
1227357 we faced a real bottleneck and so we decided to launch the bed and breakfast scheme
1227358 it fixes the shortage and enhances cultural interaction between indian families and foreigners
1227359 and it also empowers women who are at home by giving them an opportunity to earn while staying at home
1227360 the fancy hotels in india cost 600 but they dont give any real local life experience
1227361 with home stays you bring up the experience and bring down the cost
1227362 many bed and breakfast enterprises insist on only well to do tourists not the backpackers they want to know the source of income before they take bookings they dont want tourists from the middle east
1227363 many of them are jointly managed by the male heads and servants and the women are not allowed to interact almost all of them have separate kitchens for tourists
1227364 i have stayed in bed and breakfast homes in france there is no interaction with the people there at all
1227365 you are given a gate card and a room card you are directed to the room where breakfast is laid nobody attends to you you are on your own here in india you have a cook a servant a guard all 24 hours for anything you need
1227366 i used to hate their calls breaking the peace of early mornings
1227367 but the foreigners love it they take their camera out as soon as they hear the vendors calls
1227368 i have learnt that there is not too much of a difference between us and them really
1227369 they embraced the fight for a new judiciary as a dream to correct all ills
1227370 he is our big hope in our drive to support the rule of law
1227371 to americas detriment because terror cannot be fought without democracy and democracy cant be sustained without an independent judiciary

1227388 it is privatizing the gains and profits and socializing the losses as usual this is socialism for wall street and the rich

1227400 obviously hes not going to play tonight and i would think if the symptoms continue its looking more and more like he may not play in this series
1227401 but thats something ill have to tell you hopefully when the game is over
1227402 what it tells you is how tough this guy is
1227403 this guy is something he wants to play and he wants to be out here
1227404 it would be pointless to sit here and be mad over things i cant control
1227405 if jones couldnt play for an extended period of time i would think wed have to get some kind of replacement up here
1227406 i dont think ive even thrown back to back in the second half
1227407 its really tough to find your rhythm ive gone three four and five days off a couple of times now

1227414 we dont like the connection being made of 9 11 terrorism and deaths in iraq
1227415 we think we got involved in iraq due to lies we think weve continued to be there because of lies and it really troubles us that the city would put a put up a monument that would make that connection
1227416 this is not a political statement this is not a political statement in anyway this is honoring our soldiers
1227417 this war was based on lies and nothing in this whole thing does it talk about those who have fallen
1227418 right now its only availible at the motorcycle safety foundation but were looking at other venues to see if we can offer that skills test endorsement more than every monday of the week

1227422 gold gets dug out of the ground in africa or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it it has no utility anyone watching from mars would be scratching their head
1227423 i like to go for cinches i like to shoot fish in a barrel but i like to do it after the water has run out
1227424 like an oversexed guy in a whorehouse now is the time to invest and get rich
1227425 i call investing the greatest business in the world because you never have to swing you stand at the plate the pitcher throws you general motors at 47 u s steel at 39 and nobody calls a strike on you theres no penalty except opportunity lost all day you wait for the pitch you like then when the fielders are asleep you step up and hit it

1227428 it is not proper for educationists to treat their students differently according to their race and to speak to them in such a manner
1227429 no one in his or her right frame of mind would have said these things given this the best option would be for the teacher to be assigned to a desk job and not be allowed to be near youngsters anymore
1227430 tenho 23 anos e treino h 3 mas de alguns dias pra c me veio uma d vida a qual nunca tinha atentado quando estou treinando aumento muito de volume mais que muitos amigos meus e tenho um colega que aumenta mais que eu por que isso acontece por que uns aumentam mais que outros
1227431 tenho 23 anos e pratico muscula o h 5 meses nesse tempo venho conseguindo um timo resultado minha alimenta o boa tomo suplementos hipercal rico e creatina sempre me alimento antes do treino nesses dois ltimos meses meu treino mudou passou a ser bem mais pesado e pelo menos uma s rie de cada exerc cio executada de forma bem concentrada com carga alta voltando o mais lento poss vel para posi o inicial venho encontrando algumas dificuldades em determinados momentos sinto tonturas e fico fraco em algumas situa es at desisto de treinar o que pode estar causando isso respira o durante o exerc cio pode ser a creatina ser que devo parar com a muscula o
1227432 tenho 26 anos malho h quase 1 ano para poder ganhar massa muscular queria ganhar pelo menos 7 quilos de massa mas s consegui ganhar 3 e isso foi nos 4 primeiros meses do treinamento de l pra c n o consigo ganhar mais estou sempre no mesmo peso mesmo puxando mais o treino e tomando amino cidos e prote nas de primeira qualidade ent o optei pelo gh apliquei 1ml no primeiro dia da s rie e na mesma noite n o consegui dormir bem acordei de madrugada e estava muito assustado pois sentia um calor profundo e suava muito o cora o estava disparado e minha cor ficou amarela vomitei e n o consegui mais dormir quero saber se isso rea o do gh ou alguma crise que qualquer um pode ter pelo medo
1227433 que existe uma limita o biol gica existe vai chegar um momento em que o atleta estar pr ximo disso mas a ci ncia ainda n o tem como determinar
1227434 existem avalia es f sicas nas quais poss vel verificar o quanto ele melhorou e o quanto houve de involu o com isso podemos determinar como est o desempenho
1227435 se voc fica no mesmo est mulo seu rendimento p ra o corredor nesse caso tende a perder performance quando ocor re a manuten o dos tempos pode ser que ele esteja treinando demais entrando em overtraining e tendo problemas com descanso mas acredito que sempre poss vel melhorar o tempo mesmo que muito pouco al m do treino da alimenta o e da cabe a preciso ver o quanto a pessoa est se dedicando ao treinamento
1227436 n o existe um consenso sobre qual metodologia melhor as duas s o eficazes mas podemos nos basear em exemplos para avalia o corredores europeus e da am rica do sul priorizam o trabalho de volume a maioria dos africanos faz o contr rio pelos resultados vemos que os atletas da frica t m conseguido mais recordes t tulos ol mpicos e mundiais
1227437 a grande maioria das pessoas que procura orienta o trabalha e tem uma rotina di ria puxada preciso analisar os objetivos mas a grande parte quer qualidade de vida de qualquer forma todos buscam ganhos no desempenho ent o preciso verificar al m dos objetivos como o bi tipo alimenta o enfim a rotina
1227438 a pessoa tem que olhar para os fatores externos pode ser o treinamento a alimenta o o psicol gico mas essencial que o corredor saiba que chega um momento em que naturalmente ele d uma parada principalmente para o amador que n o tinha hist rico no esporte existe uma melhora grande no in cio do trabalho e depois ela ocorre aos poucos
1227439 com o amador o erro mais comum n o mudar o treino preciso haver varia o o que n o pode acontecer tamb m a pessoa treinar demais o descanso um fator muito importante na corrida
1227440 importante explicar o treino o motivo de estar fazendo isso ou aquilo al m de esclarecer a import ncia do descanso
1227441 para ocorrer uma mudan a efetiva h necessidade de uma boa conversa esclarecendo os novos rumos do treinamento seus m todos e poss veis resultados o atleta precisa estar o mais pr ximo de seu t cnico para que ele possa influenci lo definitiva e positivamente
1227442 quando o atleta apresenta m alimenta o durante o treinamento come a a ter problemas de les o muscular o corpo n o encontra a energia que procura para aquela atividade e nesse caso quem sofre s o os m sculos
1227443 cada atleta um caso diferente mas de qualquer forma preciso que a alimenta o desse corredor tenha equil brio
1227444 quando o treinamento ou a competi o for mais longa vale consumir isot nicos o que o atleta deve fazer se pesar antes e depois da atividade aquela quantidade de peso perdida ao final da corrida precisa ser reposta em l quidos principalmente em bebida esportiva ao longo do dia
1227445 muitas pessoas no brasil ainda t m preconceito e n o sabem da real import ncia desse trabalho
1227446 temos que avaliar como essa pessoa lida com a atividade quando sua motiva o pela competi o seus advers rios s o os outros corredores quando pela realiza o o advers rio ele pr prio
1227447 elas s o inversamente proporcionais quanto mais ansioso menos concentrado muitos corredores quebram quando ficam muito ansiosos e isso passa a interferir no desempenho f sico
1227448 esse medo por si s um dos fatores gerados pela ansiedade mente e corpo trabalham juntos se a pessoa estiver com um n vel muito alto de ansiedade a concentra o abalada sua cabe a cansa e o corpo sente o cansa o
1227449 se a pessoa tiver a planilha alterada uma vez por m s deve fazer a avalia o todo m s ela est interligada com o tipo de treino

1227489 scotland has an excellent reputation for developing innovative video games and scottish enterprise has a vested interest in supporting forward thinking and ambitious companies in this key sector it gives us an enormous amount of pleasure to be sponsoring the vip dinner for what is undoubtedly one of the most important events in the video gaming calendar
1227490 we are delighted to be a part of this years edinburgh interactive festival and more specifically to be sponsoring the dare to be digital networking lunch as ncsoft knows only too well through its own highly successful apprenticeship scheme ensuring talented students get to mix with some of the industrys most influential movers and shakers will only help in ensuring that the uk remains at the forefront of games development
1227491 bringing the dare to be digital contestants and the games industry together is one of the core aims of the competition the industry is on a constant lookout for talent and ideas while the students need to look for opportunities the eif networking lunch can help achieve both ends
1227492 we chose to bring this game to the west because we believe in its potential the guaranteed fun promotion is our way of showing our belief in the game and is even better than a money back guarantee because you dont have to spend a penny to play asda story
1227493 we are just asking you to invest your time in playing our game and if after playing for 30 days you dont feel it has been the great game experience we feel it to be we want to hear your feedback and well give you 30 00 it is as simple as that

1227503 not taken for matters occurring in open court in the presence of the judges notice should be given to the attorney of the charges made and opportunity afforded him for explanation and defence
1227504 the state procedure from want of notice or opportunity to be heard was wanting in due process
1227505 such procedural violation of due process would never pass muster in any normal civil or criminal litigation

1227510 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1227511 we will come out of the financial crisis but we still have to confront that problem of a changing balance between growth and inflation or what we like to call stagflation
1227512 with corporate adjustments just beginning the euro area is at risk of significantly underperforming the u s and global economy for some quarters to come
1227513 we expect the fed to stay on hold at 2 0 percent at the next four meetings
1227514 as inflation eases and the economic recovery fails to materialize we expect the fed to make two quarter point cuts in the first half of 2009
1227515 we are sure that this is nothing more than imposing the reform project that was rejected in december
1227516 there are things that can be done without the necessity of reforming the constitution
1227517 restrict or prohibit the import export distribution exchange or sale
1227518 the government believes it can advance toward a centralized state run economic system but thats going to cause more conflict with the business community
1227519 we are sure that this is nothing more than imposing the reform project that was rejected in december

1227523 a person who has a gun sees danger we will have more shootings more accidents
1227524 gun control advocates said it would put too many guns in malls parks and workplaces causing fights and accidental shootings
1227525 we believe immediate access and availability enhances chances for firearms violence when you introduce firearms a situation that would not normally result in deadly violence can be tragic
1227526 its all guns all the time regardless of how many children law enforcement officers and ordinary people die each year because of easy accessibility to firearms
1227527 its going to lead to tragedies and accidents of all kinds
1227528 if we have more use of guns then were going to have more people who are injured and die
1227529 a year after the right to carry law is enacted ohioans will wonder what all the fuss was about claims that ohioans safety is endangered will lose credibility once people see that criminals not law abiding citizens have the most to fear from ohioans increased ability to defend themselves

1227531 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1227532 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1227533 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1227534 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded

1227538 eighty one million tonnes of co2 abatement each year by 2020 is around 20 per cent of australias total carbon abatement targets

1227541 chainsaws and bulldozers for the entirely unnecessary export woodchip industry
1227542 what theyre doing is quite deceitfully diverting attention to a proposal for plantations
1227543 it is nowhere near the destruction that nafi including timber giant gunns is wrecking day by day in the forests of australia these great living natural carbon banks
1227544 it was noticeable when the flirtation with the liberal party happened over the last few weeks people came up to me or into the office and said please dont do that
1227545 and as well the opportunity of working with government from a community perspective you need to have access for outcomes
1227546 the luxury weve got for this by election is that we know who the government of the day is for the next five years wed be nuts to put ourselves back into the opposition
1227547 if i lose on those terms i cop it sweet im happy about that
1227548 but if this is going to be a drag down rather than a build up exercise then that says more about those chucking the mud than anyone else
1227549 the drafting and redrafting of the schedule this year has been the most challenging we have ever undertaken
1227550 the standard on the court will be higher than ever with our teams having been able to strengthen significantly their rosters due to the leagues contraction to ten teams
1227551 in discussions with des he was very frustrated and suffering anxiety because things werent going right
1227552 i even got to the point of saying youre not ready dont go
1227553 i believe the boat to be in good condition and had i not sold it i might have embarked on a voyage such as des
1227554 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future
1227555 ultimately it is about a fair outcome as opposed to a ludicrous bid
1227556 what their bid is about is 2 8 billion more over three years the whole education budget is 2 billion so it is totally unaffordable it is sort of magic pudding meets wizard of oz
1227557 i am happy to have people protest outside my electoral office but it is not going to change the situation at all
1227558 what we have said to you is that he was a co conspirator and he did his part his driving his bodyguarding his protective service his low key movements his shell game of moving bin laden around knowing that an operation was about to occur
1227559 a plethora of facts that shows you how he committed overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy
1227560 hamdan was al qaeda every fact in this case points to that
1227561 mr hamdan is not an al qaeda warrior he is not last line of defence
1227562 you should not punish the generals driver today with the crimes of the general
1227563 tremendous attention focused on the proceedings here today not only domestically but internationally
1227564 the general is a war criminal and therefore the driver also is it didnt work that way in world war ii hitlers driver was never charged with a war crime and it doesnt work that way today
1227565 there has been no evidence that mr hamdan either planned or executed any terrorist acts
1227566 he is fit to change trucks tyres change oil filters wash and clean cars
1227567 you read the hqcc report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1227568 and the really terrifying part is its still the same attempt by the bureaucracy to say its not our fault lets blame the doctors
1227569 but queensland health are to blame and the only change ive seen is that the bureaucrats are now smarter about how they get back at whistleblowers
1227570 if you see harm being done whether youre a doctor or a nurse or a bureaucrat youve got to report it
1227571 most of the bodies were floating inside they were trapped when the seven story ship suddenly tilted and capsized
1227572 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard about which direction they wanted to go in
1227573 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short
1227574 im not involved in two of the formats and alastair cook hasnt been in the twenty20 side recently
1227575 i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1227576 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1227577 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some used to someone else being in charge
1227578 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday to realise it is an encompassing job
1227579 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1227580 kp pietersen is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge strauss said
1227581 it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
1227582 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed
1227583 he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1227584 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
1227585 he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
1227586 i thought straussy had a really good chance too but theyve chosen kevin and hes got some really good people around him
1227587 hes an excellent batter and demands respect with his batting hes also not shy of making the big decisions those big decisions are not going to affect that style of guy
1227588 he hasnt done too much captaining before so it will be interesting but all i know is he has the support of everyone
1227589 evidence provided to the inquiry does not support the proposition that retail prices have risen while farm gate prices have stagnated or declined
1227590 while there may be some instances where this has occurred generally movements in farm gate pricing are determined by supply and demand in international national and local markets
1227591 changes in the wholesale prices that coles woolworths and metcash pay suppliers are reflected in movements in shelf prices over time
1227592 this has had a dynamic impact on the grocery sector and brought about competitive responses from coles and woolworths on many products
1227593 competition between retailers is however sufficient to ensure that coles and woolworths cannot simply retain all of the benefits of the lower wholesale prices they extract at least some of the benefits flow to consumers in the form of lower retail prices

1227601 there will be two or three thousand tons of extra supply this year
1227602 the drug threat in afghanistan remains unacceptably high and requires a long term commitment by both the afghan government and international donors
1227603 the fact is that all is not well with pakistan cricket
1227604 from reports of internal wrangling to charges of financial misappropriation and from serious and persistent questions about nomination of the teams captain and the coach to the alleged misconduct of certain players there is a lot that needs corrective action within the set up
1227605 lock him away remembering to throw away the key at least long enough that he never represents pakistan again
1227606 any change in this situation will be a long term process that depends on north korea changing its behavior and bringing its domestic anti money laundering and counterterrorist financing regime into compliance with international standards

1227644 if you were being sensible you would put an immediate moratorium on all old growth logging all around the country because its clear the carbon stocks are so much higher than anyone has previously analysed before
1227645 the last thing you would do would be to log old growth forests in tasmania or victoria
1227646 we seem rather unfair to other sectors who are you know having a close scrutiny of emissions profiles from you know the energy sector and coal and transport and we really should be doing the same for all sectors
1227647 it was noticeable when the flirtation with the liberal party happened over the last few weeks people came up to me or into the office and said please dont do that
1227648 and as well the opportunity of working with government from a community perspective you need to have access for outcomes
1227649 the luxury weve got for this by election is that we know who the government of the day is for the next five years wed be nuts to put ourselves back into the opposition

1227652 mentoring by ip specialists on real case scenarios through hypothetical scenarios
1227653 demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1227654 on balance however it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1227655 inflation is likely to remain relatively high in the short term with the cpi affected by high global oil prices
1227656 looking further ahead inflation in both cpi and underlying terms is likely to decline over time given the outlook for demand provided wages growth remains moderate
1227657 the evidence is that the tightening in financial conditions in conjunction with other factors including rising fuel costs and lower asset values has restrained demand
1227658 indicators of household spending have continued to record subdued outcomes over recent months and credit expansion to both households and businesses has slowed significantly
1227659 surveys suggest a softening in business activity and there have also been some early signs of an easing in labour market conditions

1227661 you read the hqcc report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1227662 look what this report tells us september 2005 issues are raised about this doctors competence they get a report from a senior surgeon quite a damning report
1227663 absolutely nothing is done for another 12 months until the whistleblowers go to a member of the federal parliament
1227664 i think its actually damaging to continue to prosecute the line that nothing has changed in queensland health
1227665 what i emphasised in our interview this morning was that these were matters that occurred between 2004 and 2006
1227666 since the bundaberg commission of inquiry there have been substantial changes to queensland health particularly how we offer support to whistleblowers
1227667 what occurred in mackay was a doctor not being properly supervised not being properly supervised by whom not a bureaucrat by a senior doctor and who was that senior doctor reporting to another senior doctor
1227668 stephen robertson accuses me and others of bureaucrat bashing his solution to this problem is doctor bashing
1227669 he wants to bring in a change to make it a criminal offence for doctors not to report their colleagues what about doing something to make it a criminal offence for bureaucrats to sit for 12 months doing nothing or nothing effective to solve these problems

1227674 for those players to be out from a football perspective six days before a game when they have had an eight day break is just unacceptable and then to top it off by being dishonest to the people in an environment where you rely on honesty and you rely on trust is unforgivable buckley said
1227675 id be suspending him indefinitely if it was me and id do the same with heath shaw theyre both mates of mine alans made too many poor choices
1227676 there needs to be a strong stance made by the club to set the tone not just for alan didak or heath shaw but for all young players at football clubs so its distinct whats acceptable and whats not there needs to be a clear line drawn

1227684 absolutely a pennsylvania statute provides for it its in their right to pay the legal bills for people who are being sued because of activities in connection to the charities
1227685 to me theres a difference between paying for some suit thats in ones service to the organization that has been approved by the board and another in paying legal bills due to the unilateral taking of the assets

1227700 what do the germaniums do to your muff and how do you change them
1227701 the united states has not met its national security goals to destroy terrorist threats and close the safe haven
1227702 we found broad agreement that al qaida had regenerated its ability to attack the united states and had succeeded in establishing a safe haven
1227703 the bush administrations limitless commitment of our limited resources to the war in iraq has compromised our focus
1227704 is dealing with the terrorist threat in pakistan through a variety of means
1227705 this is going to be a long battle against a determined enemy
1227706 i think its a near impossibility that these cases will be in court before the end of the administration
1227707 some of the detainees havent even seen their lawyers yet theres incredibly complicated issues about access to evidence and discovery and as weve seen with every single case to date its incredibly hard to move through a system that lacks established rules and precedent
1227708 every little detail ends up being contested because its an entirely new system of justice
1227709 assuming its referred i expect there to be vigorous litigation by the defense community and the prosecution community
1227710 it will be helpful to the process for there to be a litigated case
1227711 this is an issue that is essential to national security and we welcome the supreme courts decision to review this case
1227712 by preventing us from conducting training in a realistic environment the restrictions put the lives of our sailors and marines at risk
1227713 its clear both that high intensity military sonar can injure and kill whales dolphins and other marine life and that the navy can reduce the risk of this harm by common sense safeguards without compromising our military readiness
1227714 the lack of coordination poses a direct threat to our national security
1227715 this is reminiscent of the substantial evidence indicating the attacks of 9 11 might have been prevented had the fbi and cia shared information
1227716 full extent of the disputes between the fbi and the atf and the steps you are taking to resolve these continuing turf battles
1227717 to ensure that resources are not wasted on duplicative programs
1227718 as chairman and ranking member of the justice departments primary oversight committee we cannot accept the status quo
1227719 in the five years since theyve been in the justice department theyve worked together to build a unified law enforcement response to threats presented by criminals and would be terrorists and are only continuing to improve this coordinated response
1227720 there had been issues over a number of years between ourselves and atf that has been reduced dramatically over the last couple of years there are a couple of issues that have to be resolved and theyre on the table to be resolved
1227721 on five occasions he was ordered to either falsify his reporting on wmd in the near east or not to file his reports at all
1227722 he is not even allowed to attend court hearings about his own case
1227723 authored or solicited and received by the presidents senior advisors in connection with a decision or potential decision to be made by the president
1227724 the cias purpose in requesting advice from olc was the very likely prospect of criminal civil or administrative litigation against the cia and cia personnel who participate in the program
1227725 weighing relevant legal factors at the start of any new program is not only logical but is the responsible thing to do unfortunately the fact that people and organizations follow the law does not prevent them from becoming the subject of litigation later on
1227726 didnt go into this system blind and they didnt build this system blind
1227727 it appears to be a calculated and calibrated effort to justify the unjustifiable
1227728 be willing to always look back at what we do and not assume that what we are doing is always the best way to do it
1227729 we have to be willing to revisit it break the mold and think outside the box
1227730 theyve been saying for the last five years that they have a mechanism for addressing these problems and the problems apparently persist
1227731 it almost sounds as if they are now trying to pass the problem off to the airlines
1227732 we need to see some strict enforceable rules for the limited use of that information
1227733 americans are in south korea americans are in japan american troops are in germany thats all fine
1227734 its pretty clear their intentions are that we put in a basing system in iraq that parallels the korea japan history
1227735 the difference is iraq is not korea or japan the history of every single outside occupation of iraq over the last thousand years argues against that logic
1227736 it is unbelievably out of touch and inconsistent with the needs and concerns of americans particularly the families of the troops out there
1227737 it is the most important thing in the world to them that they come home
1227738 a real disturbing pattern of confusing the basic facts of iraq
1227739 this is another partisan attempt to distort john mccains words to distract the american people from the fact that john mccain has been courageous and right about the surge in iraq and barack obama has unfortunately been consistently wrong
1227740 unless either of these agreements includes a specific and automatic commitment to come to defense of another country if there is an attack on it like we have with japan and our nato allies then these agreements do not have to be submitted to the senate
1227741 that suggests to the american people and to all the world that you envision an american occupation of iraq for decades to come
1227742 unable to assume full responsibility for the maintenance of security
1227743 theres a deep irony here which is that the discussion of the status of force agreement in iraq deeply involves the iraqi parliament and the discussion on the american side doesnt give the american people the same kind of involvement
1227744 the debate in baghdad is finally beginning to reverberate in washington
1227745 a full explanation of both the rationale for and the substance of
1227746 the director simply said in his interview that progress has been made against al qaeda which remains a very dangerous foe that judgment should be no surprise to anyone familiar with the intelligence
1227747 a notional view of some of the issues that will be raised in the oval office pdb
1227748 lets imagine for tonight that you have just been sworn in youre the 44th president of the united states
1227749 your first post inaugural briefing will for the foreseeable future remain the threats and challenges emanating from the middle east
1227750 which player or players is are the most likely not to be a cardinal come august
1227751 it probably wont surprise you that one name dominated the discussion
1227752 sf ntul ilie pr znuit n episcopia caransebe ului ndemn la solidaritate cre tin al preafericitului p rinte patriarh daniel predarea religiei ortodoxe n colile din grecia va deveni facultativ
1227753 the memo makes plain as day that al marri was declared an enemy combatant based on discredited legal opinions and for the illegal purpose of abusive interrogations
1227754 im not sure the yoo memo is of direct assistance to mr marri
1227755 the memo primarily concerns aggressive forms of interrogation not primarily the presidents authority to designate individuals as enemy combatants
1227756 perfectly legitimate for counsel to bring this to the courts attention
1227757 representing the united states around the world is a serious piece of business
1227758 she wasnt representing the united states as secretary of state chairman of the joint chiefs or u s trade representative but she was representing the united states and she did have specific assignments
1227759 they cannot and do not speak to the substance of her meetings with staff advisers administration officials citizens activists foreign leaders and others with whom she worked on policy issues that should be no surprise its not what they were created to do
1227760 negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from bosnia and said she advised her husband to intervene to stop the rwanda genocide
1227761 there is no reason to believe that she was a key player in foreign policy at any time during the clinton administration
1227762 she did not do any heavy lifting with foreign governments she never managed a foreign policy crisis
1227763 i would not say she was sitting there planning cruise missile attacks
1227764 but youre there and you see and you understand the requirements of leadership having lived through it even as a spouse you absorb a lot
1227765 what you need is the nuance about the politics of the situation what is the psychology of the people youre going to meet and that sort of thing
1227766 the silent partner to municipal county state and federal justice agencies who access our databases every day to locate subjects develop background information secure information from a cellular or unlisted number and much more
1227767 there is never ever enough information when it comes to terrorism
1227768 we have significantly reduced the risk of a major attack in the short term
1227769 to stop new attacks on america we need to know who the terrorists are talking to what theyre saying and what theyre planning
1227770 continuing to refine themselves and improve themselves if we dont do more than were doing if we stop eventually that risk is going to start to increase
1227771 to suggest we have stopped everything for three years is incorrect
1227772 there is no basis to suggest that this process is in any way insufficient to protect the privacy and civil liberties of americans
1227773 i think the way is now clear to stand it up and go warm on it
1227774 i have had a firsthand experience with the trust me theory of law from this administration
1227775 i wont make the same mistake i want to see the legal underpinnings for the whole program
1227776 we still dont know whether the nao will pass constitutional muster since no legal framework has been provided
1227777 gave aid to al qaeda the taliban and other anti coalition militants
1227778 given his past and the continuing threat he posed to american interests
1227779 determined to meet that terrorist threat but using only methods that our laws allow
1227780 these groups are quite robust in their ability to replace those who are lost in fact they expect it and plan for it
1227781 that doesnt diminish the value of capturing or killing terrorists it simply puts it in context
1227782 congress must step up its oversight of the cia program and force an end to the use of torture and other inhuman methods of interrogation by all us personnel
1227783 secret detention and abuse of detainees impeded this important objective
1227784 what do i need to do to remove my name from this list
1227785 ofacs list of designated individuals and entities is a powerful tool that disrupts financial flows to terrorists narcotics traffickers and proliferators of weapons of mass destruction
1227786 this vigilance has an important deterrent effect and shines a light on illicit conduct
1227787 there isnt a program of redress there isnt an ombudsman there isnt a procedure to help consumers clear their names
1227788 if russia objects and is alienated by nato enlargement the cost to the west potentially grows higher we should not allow such objections to dictate nato policies on the other hand to proceed with a plan for european security that doesnt take into account russian positions would be shortsighted
1227789 we agreed today that these countries will become members of nato
1227790 i know that there has been a lot of talk about a russian veto theres been a lot of talk about russian pressure
1227791 but if ever there were evidence that russia did not have an effect i think that the language
1227792 if i were a russian i would say this was not a good day
1227793 i cannot report that this morning we saw stunning breakthroughs
1227794 the emergence of a powerful military bloc at our borders will be seen as a direct threat to russias security
1227795 i heard them saying today that expansion is not directed against russia but its the potential not intentions that matters
1227796 why should we be flexible if its a question of a threat to our security
1227797 what were seeing in europe is interest in what russia can give european countries and particularly european business
1227798 in an organization as large as dod the largest and most complex in the world there will be mistakes
1227799 but they cannot be tolerated in the arena of strategic systems whether they are nuclear or only associated equipment as was in this case
1227800 this is a case of horrifying mismanagement of the inventory at this location
1227801 but it does seem more like mismanagement rather than a nefarious scheme to get them to taiwan
1227802 identify issues similar to those in the report issued last march
1227803 we are committed to ensuring that we not only get this right but maintain the vital trust of the american people
1227804 but we also though as americans we believe in our privacy rights and we want those protected
1227805 its becoming more and more obvious that outside oversight is essential since the bureaus learning curve is sadly unimpressive
1227806 instituting judicial oversight would guarantee that someone would be looking over the shoulder of agents using a tool as invasive as an nsl
1227807 our techniques and the experts that we have believe that our techniques are effective and are sufficient and appropriate to our mission
1227808 and those techniques are founded on a desire to develop a rapport and a relationship
1227809 the most technologically advanced border security initiative in american history
1227810 we have delayed our deployment as we work through the issues on project 28 while there is clear urgency of the mission we also want to make sure we do this right
1227811 do not yet know the type of terrain where the fencing is to be constructed the materials to be used or the cost to acquire the land
1227812 lets get the film done there are people waiting to see it
1227813 in the midst of a bitter political year a loose bipartisan consensus on the mideast may be emerging and irony of ironies the consensus seemingly embraced by obama seems closer to bushs views than to those of the antiwar activists who propelled the illinois senator to the nomination
1227814 my background is in finance and production and robyns is in talent management and we see this as a natural progression
1227815 we share clients with all of the major agencies and will turn to them for help in finding great material with the only requirement that we want to have north american theatrical distribution to protect our downside
1227816 stunning comprehension of that thing we call courage in a man
1227817 there are scenes in the film that are taken from life
1227818 what the marshal was unwilling to do is to give up doing his duty just because everyone else found excuses to stay out of the fight
1227819 start praying that when its over we wont drop our badge in the dirt
1227820 the movie is really about kane and what he will do
1227821 i worked day and night re cutting the film i felt the emphasis should be on gary cooper and his problem and anything that didnt contribute to this should be eliminated
1227822 where a decent woman couldnt walk down the street in broad daylight
1227823 theyre making me run ive never run from anybody before
1227824 despite the fact that he looks like that kid from mad magazine
1227825 were coming to throw garbage in your recycling containers and drink all your soda pop
1227826 and now for it to come to this is very very disappointing
1227827 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1227828 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
1227829 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east

1227944 debased trivial culture that voids both the deep realities and also the simple spontaneous pleasures

1227947 unless we broaden and deepen our perception of both the universe and our fellow members of society we all may perish in persisting to manipulate each other and our ecosystem with materialism and exploitation
1227948 its the next watershed mark in our evolutionary journey which alone can provide us with the empowerment and insight needed to overcome the gathering forces of ecological devastation greed and war which now threaten our survival
1227949 even under such persecution it is becoming a strong force that the cpc communist party of china will not be able to stop one day soon
1227950 there is an enormous vacuum in every chinese persons heart no belief no moral standards and in this situation when they meet a falun gong person or read a falun gong book which teaches them how to be a good person and gives moral guidelines for living they are really awakened and shaken
1227951 i couldnt understand why the government didnt allow us to know these things
1227952 it makes me wonder how can i still trust the textbooks
1227953 chinese schools are only a place to cram communist party philosophy into students not to give you knowledge
1227954 the authorities penalise teachers who want to be good teachers so they are victims too
1227955 many people like me have really risked our lives including in jail to try and let the world know what is happening and that is enough in my opinion
1227956 were not trying to push people when i asked li and wang about going to tiananmen square they said of course we want to do that but there are so many people who need help here to hear about falun gong
1227957 the problem is that the powers that be are using the games to persecute people
1227958 were just trying to help people understand the cpcs evil nature and that they can break free
1227959 how can i overthrow the government i dont have a weapon and i have to be careful all the time

1227961 our stone is nothing but gold digested to the highest degree of purity and subtle fixation our gold no longer vulgar is the ultimate goal of nature
1227962 it is called a stone by virtue of its fixed nature it resists the action of fire as successfully as any stone in species it is gold more purer than the purest it is fixed and incombustible like a stone but its appearance is that of a very fine powder
1227963 he who brought the noble and precious stone to his majesty
1227964 the great one over the secrets of the house of gold
1227965 as for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turned up as it were fire the stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath the dust of gold

1227967 it is now known that it is possible to modify space time in a way that allows a spaceship to travel at an arbitrarily large speed by a purely local expansion of the space time behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it a motion faster than the speed of light reminiscent of the warp drive of science fiction
1227968 exotic matter will be needed to generate a distortion of space time
1227969 the idea relies on the concept that to physicists space is not empty space has a shape that can be distorted by matter the starship would simply rest in a warp bubble between the two space time distortions
1227970 matter with the curious property of having a negative energy density unlike normal matter the stuff that makes up people the planets and the stars which has a positive energy

1227974 is there anything i can do or get that would make this better
1227975 i abstain you from making any moral decisions and you make me follow no one else but my own sense of reality we make each other much more the sociopath
1227976 it was one of the most hilarious speeches i had ever heard

1228030 there are a lot of substances that do this many are called endocrine mimics that utterly confuse human hormonal systems most plastics are full of them you with me so far

1228032 thats not to say that your emotions arent always under your control if you meditate and examine yourself and your motives but of course most muggles dont and so the guys are left scratching their heads and both sexes end up mistaking the other one for an entirely separate species

1228067 if i were a producer and i had to make a casting decision about hiring voight or some older actor who hadnt ticked me off with an idiotic washington times op ed piece i might very well say to myself voight
1228068 the radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2 5 million people in cambodia and south vietnam did they stop the war or did they bring the war to those innocent people in the end they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away
1228069 if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way

1228071 i finally get what angelina jolie has been on about all these years i think most people reading the voight piece will say okay the times gave him the rope and he hung himself but youd think an arch conservative working in an overwhelmingly liberal town would think about restraining himself for expediencys sake if nothing else
1228072 as a young production executive at the studio i was trying to push love story forward and joined colleagues in trying to interest voight in the part
1228073 reading voights op ed piece these many years later i realize how right he was
1228074 i was quoted making several statements to a los angeles magazine reporter that do not reflect my personal beliefs and values or the way that i run the newsroom nevertheless i am deeply sorry and regret that they offended anyone it will not happen again
1228075 its been said in this town many times that the right has a debt to pay for the blacklisting of lefties in the 50s and that in all fairness its probably going to take a long time to make amends the fact is that the philosophical grandfathers and great grandfathers of todays right wingers ruined the lives of many hollywood screenwriters in the 50s and so their descendants now have to suffer and make up for that

1228114 there are two routes leading to the temple and the barricades put up to streamline human traffic broke down and in the melee everything went haywire
1228115 it was raining very heavily and the crowds had swelled immensely and as soon as the rain stopped people tried to rush ahead
1228116 there was a man with his child and he was shaking the child to see if he was alive and all the time tears were flowing down his cheeks
1228117 no one from the police or administration was helping and it was just people helping each other in the pouring rain
1228118 there was total chaos everywhere and i saw dead bodies everywhere and blood soaked survivors crying for help
1228119 i am so shocked that i am trembling in my house and terrified to step out and go to work
1228120 putting troops on the street sends a dramatic message that the situation is more serious than it is in reality

1228127 this will definitely create a lot of troubles for the peace process and for the security in darfur

1228129 all that sudan has done is to put its case to the au and i think that the critics who think that when it suits their interests the au should ignore its interests in order to let the interests of the critics prevail is unrealistic

1228133 all those who have the idea to put additional pressure on serbia are knocking on open doors because not only has serbia shown its will and determination but it also has made concrete steps related to this co operation

1228138 the community is in shock not so long ago there was this very happy event with two lovely people and two lovely families and then out of the blue comes this sad news its very difficult for people to handle
1228139 ben was a conscientious student he was professional at all times he took on responsibilities beyond those required of him
1228140 he was valued by all he came into contact with both at university and in the clinical setting
1228141 ben was caring articulate and dedicated to his chosen profession
1228142 he will be greatly missed our condolences go to the families of ben and catherine
1228143 the control of the idf and security forces in jericho is absolute and anyone who deviates from normative behavior and engages in criminal activity or terror will be removed from there quickly
1228144 i explained to them the difference between gaza and the west bank and how they will need to behave differently
1228145 none of them are saints but none of them are mega terrorists either and each and every one of them was checked by the shin bet
1228146 why do they always send these guys to our city
1228147 many fatah gunmen who were sent to jericho over the past few years gave us a very hard time i believe that the presence of the hilles people here wills scare away many tourists
1228148 we dont want to empty the gaza strip of its residents
1228149 if we start absorbing people from the gaza strip in the west bank we will see tens of thousands of palestinians run away from the hamas regime
1228150 the ongoing conflict between hamas and fatah only serves the interests of israel

1228152 kadima is our home one should not turn ones back on it
1228153 general elections are not in israels best interest therefore we should concentrate our efforts on showing unity and confidence in our ability to form a coalition
1228154 the magnets started flying off and hitting the wall and i had to duck for cover
1228155 lenzs law is essentially magnetic friction which is a form of resistance not unlike the wind resistance your car experiences when driving down the highway
1228156 what i can say with full confidence is that our system violates the law of conservation of energy
1228157 now is that perpetual motion will it end up being that
1228158 the world we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done so far creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level we created them at
1228159 when most people ask that question i get the impression they dont mean is there a creator
1228160 the question has more than one answer depending on what you really mean i dont believe that you mean is there a judge but let me answer that one first anyway
1228161 theres only one judge that counts and at the moment of your death your eyes are riveted open to every act and deed youve ever done stripped bare before the completely aware gaze of a conscience thats more penetrating and aware than you could believe
1228162 but at the same timeless time youre also suffused with the very spirit of parental compassion so your judgment of yourself is an admixture of severity and mercy if you like
1228163 those are the names of these two sephiras of the tree of life by the by translated from ancient hebrew i prefer clarity and compassion myself
1228164 you decide whether youve created a perfect pattern or not one that satisfies your expanded esthetic and ethical senses the heart that balances the feather of truth
1228165 but more than that from the true perspective of immortal justice the obvious macrocosmic truth is revealed the secret of all enlightenment
1228166 and you decide whether youve lived life as best you could or fallen short of your own abilities
1228167 you may even decide to come back here again anyway to help out
1228168 you are the judge jury prosecutor defender executioner and redeemer dont accept any substitutes
1228169 on the one hand i side with the gnostics before they were all slaughtered and burned at the stake they insisted that those who purport to be the creator like jehovah for instance or jupiter are actually demons masquerading as the one true god but it gets complex the ancients viewed the planets as gods and goddesses remember and many deeds and attributes ascribed to them are referents to planetary events changes and catastrophes incidentally god is a pretty horrendous word for what were talking about dont you think
1228170 the gnostics pointed out that no compassionate creator would ever do the things described in the old babbling books and that any entity that did was an ego driven demon who should be ignored and driven out at all costs the gnostics went a little too far for my taste claiming the universe itself was an evil cage i understand their erroneous point of view but in the long run they were a bit too nihilistic for their own good
1228171 were talking about something not constrained by our primate templates of authority and awareness and if it comes down to a choice between the archetypes of sky father and earth mother these days i have to come down on the side of the mother
1228172 im with you there bro its nungeena around here right
1228173 its just that where i first became exposed to this stuff her name was pacha mama
1228174 how much do you know about uh dimensional theory have you ever seen a hypercube
1228175 lets start at the other end its easier from down there
1228176 you know there are an infinite number of points in any line
1228177 and there are an infinite number of lines in any given plane right
1228178 well there are also an infinite number of planes in any solid right
1228179 and there are an infinite number of three dimensional solids in hyperspace
1228180 virtual worlds from this point perspective just as our universe is an illusion when viewed from theirs
1228181 so from that heightened perspective from the view of a consciousness dwelling in hyperspace not beyond or apart from this world but implicately involved in everything here as intrinsic as space or time you could be aware of every sparrow that falls every leaf on every tree and every thought in every being simultaneously
1228182 from up here you can see everything inside that flat circle simultaneously right its all visible at once
1228183 now on the second last and penultimate hand in this trick deck theres another point or two i must make if you want a near complete answer
1228184 like the egyptians with that dwarf character what was his name
1228185 so the geometric certainty of an interpenetrating series of interdimensional
1228186 so we have a judge an architect mother nature and a witness but what about a creator
1228187 for a start its all a hologram so you are already partaking of all of those forms of godhood your consciousness already extrudes into all the other dimensions but were usually untrained to perceive or make use of any of them but the familiar ones that are useful to terrestrial primates theyre all accessible if you start young enough or are very fortunate or have enough focus and will power the truth is thou art god
1228188 now if you really want to pin me down about a creator on the one octopoid tentacle with an infinity of infinities to ponder a creator cant be rendered impossible and anything not impossible is not only probable but likely or even mandatory
1228189 we can ill explain how if you like do you know anything about brane theory m theory membrane theory
1228190 is this answering my question about a possible or probable creator
1228191 okay then you know how in current understandings of time travel if you go back in time and kill your grandfather theres no paradox at all
1228192 no because when you leave the bubble of this hologram and enter another one it
1228193 if you can imagine the sort of obsessive personality that wants to go back in time and change history and not even their own history you understand they know its a parallel history theyre tampering with but want to do it anyway youll understand why a lot of the so called gods of the past have been such primitive control freaks
1228194 thats where you cant tell the velocity and trajectory of any subatomic particle at the same time
1228195 thats right and the implications as derived by modern physicists are that the
1228196 the more diverse the range of lifeforms in a place the more enduring the landform itself and all other factors like climate for instance life
1228197 and if mind over matter is real and it is then all the other so called psychic phenomena are equally real and accessible to us all
1228198 were creating it all all the time everythings an interpenetrating hologram and were all points of the same distributed consciousness of the same there has to be a better word than oddgod but if youre looking for a creator look in the mirror
1228199 what do you think step out of the chains binding your mind and life
1228200 film noir style urban drama based in rich characters that will explore the human conditions across the board
1228201 time traveler a scientists personal mission to make time travel a reality
1228202 michael alisa reminds me a lot of myself when i was a freshman hes got some skills he just has to settle down a little bit
1228203 hes got a nose for the football i think he has a bright future ahead of him
1228204 hes working hard he could get some reps in the games hopefully
1228205 the world and most zimbabweans pray for a free and fair election not marred by violence and intimidation as in the past
1228206 we urge the sadc observers to produce a report characterised by integrity and honestly we have let down the suffering people of zimbabwe for too long already they deserve better
1228207 since the runoff was announced the violence in zimbabwe has gotten even worse zimbabweans cant vote freely if they fear their vote may get them killed
1228208 generally the issues that relate to these food shortages cannot be divorced from the governance issues of this country
1228209 we have failed to produce enough food because of government failure to provide inputs for the national requirements in time
1228210 we had a target of 70 000ha but we only achieved 30 379ha
1228211 they died not because they thought life was good or death was good but because they knew how to accomplish each one best
1228212 somewhere a true believer is training to kill you he is training in austere conditions training day
1228213 i dont think we were dragged out of africa in the slave trade
1228214 what we do claim is that the northern european and particularly anglo saxons made this country oh yes the others helped they added to it they often enriched it but they did not make it and they have not yet greatly changed it and what we assert is that we are not going to surrender it to somebody else or allow other people no matter what their merits to make it something different
1228215 giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys

1228266 we are god fearing people and we believe in the american system and we believe it will ultimately turn out ok
1228267 you need to back off your getting in my boundaries
1228268 a 20 per cent rise next year might be achievable and there is certainly talk of a smaller one the year after
1228269 we dont subscribe to the theory that it is suddenly going to fall to the depths which some of the analysts do
1228270 why we dont subscribe to that theory is that all of the infrastructure is full at the moment so any new projects have roughly the same amount of capital intensity it doesnt matter if its us or bhp or rio
1228271 i think were also seeing projects are harder to develop than people think
1228272 were not convinced that all the projects out there will ramp up as quickly as has been talked about
1228273 there has been quite a push to move away from it
1228274 from what ive seen the steel makers and iron ore producers are relatively comfortable with it
1228275 we might move into a pricing separation based on some very high grade iron ore and some lower grade
1228276 weve seen that already with lump going up 95 per cent and fines only went up by 85 per cent
1228277 lump is getting harder to find and is a premium product
1228278 of course these improvements in passenger facilitation have required substantial investment and security costs continue to be well above the level which is currently recoverable under the existing airline charging agreement map chief executive kerrie mather said

1228284 the australian reinvigoration of the industry has not really been successful weve been trying to re mine old deposits
1228285 this industry is dependent on new discoveries and new mines coming on stream and at the moment its not happening
1228286 its very very tough in places like south africa and australia to bring costs down because youre fighting a losing battle given the maturity of the belt that youre mining
1228287 without wanting to just preach our story i think youve got to go to new jurisdictions
1228288 and thats challenging as well because youve got to find those jurisdictions that have geological potential and manageable political risk
1228289 and thats where we think china has been under recognised
1228290 if you speak to the majors they say that china is difficult and it is its bureaucratically complex but its geopolitically very stable
1228291 the survey shows quite startlingly that the impact of slowing domestic demand is starting to take its toll on australian business accis director of industry policy and economics greg evans said in canberra
1228292 encouragingly on the inflation front both wage and non wage costs have indeed moderated as have business input prices he said
1228293 acci considers moderation in wage and non wage growth as well as declining business confidence and profit growth reduce the possibility of a wage price inflation spiral despite headline inflation hitting a 13 year high of 4 5 per cent in the year to june mr evans said
1228294 given the notable slowing in growth acci considers that an interest rate cut should be considered as early as possible

1228316 thats significantly pushed the us dollar higher and hurt the aussie and the kiwi dollars and other currencies
1228317 the selling pressure on the australian dollar has come from the fact weve had a fall in commodity prices and weve seen a rebound in the us dollar
1228318 im extremely paranoid about my laptop when i come to the checkpoint
1228319 weve had customers whove been told to remove their laptops from the bag for screening this isnt the fault of the bag tsa is moving as quickly as possible to deploy signage and new standard operating procedures to their screeners
1228320 dont go lebron your the reason why i love nba so much now
1228321 when i was on their campus i knew that was the place i wanted to be
1228322 that feeling just stuck in my head throughout the summer and ultimately it was the deciding factor
1228323 i said to myself maybe in the fall i could get looked at by a school at an even higher level but all they would be looking for is a spot to fill
1228324 when i get to vermont i think i can be a contributing factor right away
1228325 this was the first time that a public sector bank was found to have been used to systematically push counterfeit currency into the open market he said
1228326 innocent villagers were being harassed in such crimes when they are not involved at all so we decided to issue identity cards to our own villagers as well as to those who come to our village
1228327 i have reservations about the effects of the deal on non proliferation on the us israel policy towards iran and on the other two non npt states of israel and pakistan
1228328 if pakistan gets the same treatment as india what is the npt all about it is in my view a total hypocrisy to pretend the india us nuclear deal is all for development and energy for the poor my most negative assessment is that the deal is a nail in the coffin of the non aligned movement and a death sentence on the npt where do we stand on nuclear disarmament
1228329 by accepting iaea safeguards inspections for its civilian nuclear facilities india no longer stands outside the global non proliferation through this initiative india enters the international mainstream thereby strengthening the regime that continues to play a vital role in enhancing international security and stability
1228330 we are preparing to bring prius into the indian market though we have not set any timeline yet
1228331 in the run up we have to develop skills to service it and make spare parts available across the country
1228332 in the long run it is economical with higher mileage and lower maintenance cost we are confident of its acceptability in the indian market as it runs both on electricity and fuel he added
1228333 we are aware that honda is launching its hybrid variant in the indian market soon despite high import tariff we can also do it with due preparation as i said earlier we have to gear up to service such a premium car by training our personnel and stocking enough spare parts with the dealer network
1228334 though we entered the indian market over a decade ago we chose to be in niche and premium segments as a marketing strategy we first introduced qualis which was a run away success in the multi utility segment
1228335 we launched innova by discontinuing qualis and yet maintained market leadership in the segment in the second hand or used car market toyota brands commands highest price even today because of their value and durability
1228336 with the indian economy poised to grow over eight nine per cent we see immense potential to grow thanks to increasing purchasing power higher aspirations among the generation next better road connectivity and migrant driven urbanization
1228337 i think the fed is going to stand on the sidelines holding at 2 0 per cent were getting a very mixed economic picture right now
1228338 i think the housing market is really the central element of this crisis
1228339 yes consumer price increases are so high that the inflation hawks will be screeching like crazy at tomorrows fomc meeting expect some strong language about inflation in the statement but no action

1228360 in november 2005 there was an internet video that surfaced that showed an aegis contractor firing wildly at civilian cars on an iraqi highway to the tune of mystery train by elvis presley
1228361 i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows the iraq war is largely about oil
1228362 deficits dont matter to my chagrin became part of republicans rhetoric
1228363 my biggest frustration remained president bushs unwillingness to wield his veto against out of control spending
1228364 the republicans in congress lost their way they swapped principle for power they ended up with neither they deserved to lose
1228365 most troubling to me was the readiness of both congress and the administration to abandon fiscal discipline
1228366 mattel takes full responsibility for these recalls and apologizes personally to you the chinese people and all of our customers who received the toys
1228367 vast majority of those products that were recalled were the result of a design flaw in mattels design not through a manufacturing flaw in chinas manufacturers
1228368 i dont want the federal government making decisions for doctors and customers
1228369 this program expands coverage federal coverage up to families earning 83 000 a year that doesnt sound poor to me
1228370 this bill would actually put new limits in place to keep states from going to very high income levels schip money would no longer be available over 300 percent of the federal poverty level which is about 60 000 for a family of four
1228371 its limited the ability to go up the income scale its focused resources on the poorest uninsured kids its imposed new duties on states to prevent government funds from crowding out employer coverage
1228372 after a lot of work the new video for carries latest single is complete and i think this is definitely one of my favorites i was truly amazed by everything we pulled off in this piece and even more impressed with carries acting skills the only draw back to making such an intense video is not being able to crack jokes with her all day and thats much harder than it sounds i had to bring out sad droopy roman and hes not as much fun but he got the job done and was able to keep carrie in her sad place she really did do an incredible job and i am happy to report that there were no fake tears or onions used in the making of this video its all carrie

1228379 there were several rooms that were on fire when the first company arrived but they were able to knock the fire down quickly
1228380 the first floor was pretty well gutted and the kitchen and the front living room and several of the bedrooms were damaged
1228381 that led the first company to believe someone was there but they did a thorough search of the property and no one was there
1228382 the dog did find some remnants of some type of petroleum products that was poured throughout the structure
1228383 what we are hoping for is a person to come forward who may know the reasons or causes behind this

1228410 im concerned with why emc is pushing for a decision on this
1228411 were trying to prevail on you to take advantage of the next few weeks and do it right
1228412 i hope the record shows the planning board really wants to do this right
1228413 were asking for another five weeks to finalize this and are not given that tonight for some reason
1228414 weve been sitting up here since 2006 trying to resolve this
1228415 along the way in good faith emc provided all the information required to render a decision

1228421 the area has been the scene of many protests rallied staged by palestinians and peace activists who are demonstrating against the building of the security fence in the area with many of the rallies turning into violent riots in which the protestors clash with idf forces and border guard officers
1228422 brigade 71 is doing outstanding work obviously the idfs main goal is operational but as long as we are needed for other security details we will perform them to the best of our ability is policing what we strive for no i would be happier if we could carry out more missions as we do in the gaza strip

1228430 you need an electronic portfolio to graduate from high school
1228431 what differentiates an electronic portfolio from a digital scrapbook or an online resume is the organization of the portfolio plus the learners reflections
1228432 purposeful collection of student work that exhibits the students efforts progress and achievements in one or more areas

1228489 taking a long term perspective on ecosystem services highlights tradeoffs among services and points to the level at which management actions will be effective
1228490 its important to keep these tradeoffs in mind in order to develop realistic management goals
1228491 we often wring our hands trying to figure out how to put values on ecosystem services
1228492 we hope policy makers will take notice that there are costs associated with these economic activities that havent been accounted for previously
1228493 ecosystem services projects are far more likely to engage a wider variety of stakeholders drawing in private agricultural landowners and engaging funds from sources such as private corporations

1228548 we spend a lot of time in the car we both hate it
1228549 the price at the pump may be a reality check for our national economy but it is also forcing us to check our personal realities
1228550 if that means less time in the car and more time outside less time spending frivolously and more time with family there is some good to the bad

1228565 executive director paul violette is well aware the trend has long term implications for transportation planning
1228566 we have a shift in the paradigm here he says that shift could translate directly into putting off turnpike expansion projects something violette says his board will be discussing in coming months
1228567 already a widening of the turnpike north of the i 295 interchange has been delayed from 2010 to 2015 and violette says that project and others could be further delayed if fuel prices stay high and people drive less some of the things weve been looking at could get pushed beyond our 10 year planning window he says
1228568 the tricky part is that no matter how many cars are on the road the snow still has to be cleared and old bridges need to be replaced and roads repaved look for transportation planning to be a major challenge in augusta in 2009

1228575 the conceptual design of the proposed york tollbooth is larger than the toll barriers on the new jersey turnpike and the lighting at the new location would be brighter than three wal mart supercenters
1228576 everyone who uses the tollbooths in maine would pay for this new plaza with increases in tolls to fix the problems at the current site does not warrant a 40 million state of the art new jersey tollbooth in maine wouldnt that money be better spent on roads and bridges in the rest of the state

1228598 taking a long term perspective on ecosystem services highlights tradeoffs among services and points to the level at which management actions will be effective
1228599 its important to keep these tradeoffs in mind in order to develop realistic management goals
1228600 we often wring our hands trying to figure out how to put values on ecosystem services
1228601 we hope policy makers will take notice that there are costs associated with these economic activities that havent been accounted for previously
1228602 ecosystem services projects are far more likely to engage a wider variety of stakeholders drawing in private agricultural landowners and engaging funds from sources such as private corporations
1228603 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1228604 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
1228605 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
1228606 lynx is one species that is vulnerable but the potential impacts of climate change on entire ecosystems are even more alarming

1228677 just to be around the guys after what hes been through with his father passing away you can get your mind off of things a little bit where you can laugh2 0and joke
1228678 but in the back of your mind the death of your father is still there you try to kind of subdue it a little bit with the laughter amongst your teammates its good to have him back
1228679 you just try to encourage him and more than anything know that his mom is doing okay a lot of people forget about the other people that it affected but weve been praying for samaris mother and family as well

1228698 he decided he doesnt have to pay and theres no enforcement for him to have to pay
1228699 this repair shop did the responsible thing they bought insurance
1228700 theres procedures if i pay you and when i write a personal check i need to know where my liability lies and that took a couple of days

1228702 when i was 13 or 14 years old my coach kent powell came to practice one day and said that the sysa program needed referees and they would pay our way through the clinic
1228703 all we had to do was referee one game a day on the weekends for about six weeks i enjoyed it and it was an easy way to make money
1228704 by meeting new people and proving that i had the ability to referee at the highest level it opened the doors to being appointed to the international panel

1228711 we will only get the 3 8 billion if the vancouver 2010 and the london 2012 games are successful
1228712 for top 7 2009 2012 we already have nine sponsors and other partners are about to be announced or signed
1228713 gazprom cannot be a sponsor until after london 2012 because of bp and that fits fine with sochi 2014
1228714 the ioc must communicate better with young people whose tastes are changing
1228715 the drivers of high inflation are mainly external they are non domestic factors
1228716 there has been a massive contraction in the demand for space and that directly reflects the softness in the economy

1228718 the lawyer complained that the proposed law would create a series of problems to phone subscribers and users
1228719 during the past few years there has been increasing concern about the exposure of children to obscene and pornographic material via the internet the increase in the use of the internet has raised serious problems concerning the unrestricted access to obscene and pornographic material especially the use by children
1228720 if an adult wishes to have unrestricted access to the internet the service may be obtained from an internet service provider in a password protected manner making a payment however the user is responsible for use of the service in proper manner and the user should ensure that the filtered websites are not accessible to children

1228722 we closed out all of our hedges on the basis that we had an optimistic view of the gold price
1228723 i think us1 200 an ounce seems like a reasonable target
1228724 id be very surprised if we didnt see us1 000 per ounce by the end of the year
1228725 the australian reinvigoration of the industry has not really been successful weve been trying to re mine old deposits
1228726 this industry is dependent on new discoveries and new mines coming on stream and at the moment its not happening
1228727 its very very tough in places like south africa and australia to bring costs down because youre fighting a losing battle given the maturity of the belt that youre mining
1228728 without wanting to just preach our story i think youve got to go to new jurisdictions
1228729 and thats challenging as well because youve got to find those jurisdictions that have geological potential and manageable political risk
1228730 and thats where we think china has been under recognised
1228731 if you speak to the majors they say that china is difficult and it is its bureaucratically complex but its geopolitically very stable
1228732 it was noticeable when the flirtation with the liberal party happened over the last few weeks people came up to me or into the office and said please dont do that
1228733 and as well the opportunity of working with government from a community perspective you need to have access for outcomes
1228734 the luxury weve got for this by election is that we know who the government of the day is for the next five years wed be nuts to put ourselves back into the opposition
1228735 if i lose on those terms i cop it sweet im happy about that
1228736 but if this is going to be a drag down rather than a build up exercise then that says more about those chucking the mud than anyone else
1228737 what we have said to you is that he was a co conspirator and he did his part his driving his bodyguarding his protective service his low key movements his shell game of moving bin laden around knowing that an operation was about to occur
1228738 a plethora of facts that shows you how he committed overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy
1228739 hamdan was al qaeda every fact in this case points to that
1228740 mr hamdan is not an al qaeda warrior he is not last line of defence
1228741 you should not punish the generals driver today with the crimes of the general
1228742 tremendous attention focused on the proceedings here today not only domestically but internationally
1228743 the general is a war criminal and therefore the driver also is it didnt work that way in world war ii hitlers driver was never charged with a war crime and it doesnt work that way today
1228744 there has been no evidence that mr hamdan either planned or executed any terrorist acts
1228745 he is fit to change trucks tyres change oil filters wash and clean cars
1228746 it was quite sickening to watch my wife almost threw up and had to lie down afterward
1228747 its in the reports you can read about it in the media reports
1228748 evidence provided to the inquiry does not support the proposition that retail prices have risen while farm gate prices have stagnated or declined
1228749 while there may be some instances where this has occurred generally movements in farm gate pricing are determined by supply and demand in international national and local markets
1228750 changes in the wholesale prices that coles woolworths and metcash pay suppliers are reflected in movements in shelf prices over time
1228751 this has had a dynamic impact on the grocery sector and brought about competitive responses from coles and woolworths on many products
1228752 competition between retailers is however sufficient to ensure that coles and woolworths cannot simply retain all of the benefits of the lower wholesale prices they extract at least some of the benefits flow to consumers in the form of lower retail prices
1228753 our global distribution diversified earning streams and strong capital position continue to help us support customers in todays challenging market conditions
1228754 as the outlook for 2008 remains uncertain we remain alert to the risks but we also see opportunity ahead
1228755 hsbc in australia will continue to position itself in those sectors and businesses where we have a fundamental competitive advantage and where we expect sustainable long term growth
1228756 the banks forecast remains that inflation will fall below three per cent during 2010
1228757 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
1228758 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1228759 the evidence is that the tightening in financial conditions in conjunction with other factors including rising fuel costs and lower asset values has restrained demand
1228760 indicators of household spending have continued to record subdued outcomes over recent months and credit expansion to both households and businesses has slowed significantly
1228761 at the same time high prices of oil and a range of other commodities have added to global inflationary risks
1228762 they are also dampening growth in a number of countries
1228763 given the opposing forces at work considerable uncertainty has surrounded the outlook for demand and inflation
1228764 inflation is likely to remain relatively high in the short term with the cpi affected by high global oil prices
1228765 looking further ahead inflation in both cpi and underlying terms is likely to decline over time given the outlook for demand provided wages growth remains moderate
1228766 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard about which direction they wanted to go in
1228767 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short
1228768 im not involved in two of the formats and alastair cook hasnt been in the twenty20 side recently
1228769 i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1228770 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1228771 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some used to someone else being in charge
1228772 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday to realise it is an encompassing job
1228773 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1228774 kp pietersen is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge strauss said
1228775 it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
1228776 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed
1228777 he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1228778 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
1228779 he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
1228780 i thought straussy had a really good chance too but theyve chosen kevin and hes got some really good people around him
1228781 hes an excellent batter and demands respect with his batting hes also not shy of making the big decisions those big decisions are not going to affect that style of guy
1228782 he hasnt done too much captaining before so it will be interesting but all i know is he has the support of everyone
1228783 if we dont foster talent were condemning the state to a bleak future

1228840 lamentablemente perdimos contacto y desde entonces que no s si aquellos espiritus siguen conmigo o qu ha sido de ellos
1228841 as que resumiendo lo que quiero saber es qu saben de este tema y si efectivamente puedo saber si tengo acompa antes si mi ngel o daniel siguen conmigo y si hay alguna forma de contactarlos o de entrenarme en su visualizacion y percepcion de cuando me ayudan por ejemplo con las tipicas corazonadas yo creo que son avisos de alguna entidad

1228845 si crees en dios crees que dios est presente en la vida en el amor en el matrimonio y en la sexualidad parece natural hablar de sexo y suprimir algunos tab es y etiquetas del pecado

1228875 were not telling anybody to leave and were not asking anybody to leave
1228876 but we are asking citizens and our visitors to pay attention to the weather and use their own judgment
1228877 we plan to talk to them again about 4 p m
1228878 what were doing is were planning for one level higher planning for the strike of a category 2 hurricane
1228879 since its come up so quickly and so close to the coast its not going to be like hurricane dolly where we were watching it for a week
1228880 people need to take it seriously and allow the possibility that it could be a low end hurricane
1228881 we will keep the runways open for landings and takeoffs as long as possible
1228882 were staffing it up because things could turn nasty quickly
1228883 our biggest concern is downed trees after the event or floodwaters and people needing to be removed
1228884 were also getting travel trailers off the north end of the island
1228885 storms never do exactly what we expect we always prepare for one level of intensity higher than it is
1228886 we love to be able to watch the weather channel as it comes off the coast of africa and moves to the u s
1228887 but a storm can develop within 24 hours and be right on top of us were prepared for those
1228888 if it looks like its headed toward any of our rigs we would evacuate
1228889 it takes time and privacy especially working out the methods which i wouldnt have guessed anyone really knew in the lab at that time

1228892 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
1228893 these kinds of situations cry out for re examination of our standards
1228894 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
1228895 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
1228896 if people see water in the roadway they should not drive through because it would probably be saltwater and damage their vehicle
1228897 since its come up so quickly and so close to the coast its not going to be like hurricane dolly where we were watching it for a week
1228898 people need to take it seriously and allow the possibility that it could be a low end hurricane
1228899 storms never do exactly what we expect we always prepare for one level of intensity higher than it is
1228900 we love to be able to watch the weather channel as it comes off the coast of africa and moves to the u s

1228906 i think hell talk a little bit about how much this election means to him and i think it will have a message about barack obama and about health care
1228907 there are a lot of glamorous people here with plenty of money to spend and we knew they would be queuing up to have some work done
1228908 business has been non stop since we started especially from british party girls
1228909 a lot of girls admit the most sleep they get is kipping on the beach in the day
1228910 we find that most of our clients are british girls who have good jobs money to spend and are here to party
1228911 their faces are obviously affected by the amount they drink smoke and sunbathe they want to do all those things but still look good
1228912 ive been having botox out here for the past two years and cant get enough of it
1228913 its great the moment i land i call christine to get some botox before i hit the clubs then after two weeks of clubbing she gives me a top up before i get on the plane home
1228914 when i tell people im 25 they never believe me
1228915 this means a fortnight of drinking a lot and getting hardly any sleep
1228916 also when im at home i go out drinking every weekend and spend most sundays in bed eating a fry up
1228917 that lifestyle really takes its toll on my face and i noticed i was getting lines around my eyes and between my eyebrows so when i heard about belisimma i decided to give botox a go
1228918 there are so many beautiful people in ibiza and i dont want to look rough here no matter how tired or hungover i am
1228919 we dont want the government shutdown to be an issue but the fact is the democrats are so overconfident that theyre willing to talk about a ban and theyre willing to talk about raising taxes on gasoline so this is just pretty incredible
1228920 but i think that once americans realize that this drilling ban will expire unless we pass something i think there is going to be just an outcry to not vote for anything that had a ban in it
1228921 if the democrats choose to hold the continuation of government operations as a hostage then as far as im concerned i cant vote for anything that has a ban in it
1228922 that would just be a betrayal of everything were talking about as republicans and i think that most republicans are going to feel that way
1228923 on october 1 the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale recovery will end enabling us to finally be able to develop more american energy unless democrats actively prohibit exploration
1228924 i hope that speaker pelosi and democrats in the house and senate recognize the pain americans are feeling and will not actively enact legislation to block the development of american energy
1228925 as far as im concerned on october 1 we should be able to begin the leasing process of drilling and mining in both of those areas of american energy supply
1228926 some republicans say they are prepared to vote against a resolution to fund the federal government for the 2009 fiscal year unless democrats agree to lift an offshore drilling moratorium
1228927 if the democrats choose to hold the continuation of government operations as a hostage then as far as im concerned i cant vote for anything that has a ban in it

1228945 i dont care what other countries people of the world think
1228946 the government blew the whistle for these guys to go to iraq and the meter ran
1228947 the government was billed for sometimes nine months before work began
1228948 this report is the latest chapter in a long sad and expensive tale about how contracting in iraq was more about shoveling money out the door than actually getting real results on the ground
1228949 these contracts were to design and build important items for oil infrastructure hospitals and education but in some cases more than half of the money padded corporate coffers instead
1228950 it is important to note that the special inspector general is not challenging any of kbrs costs referenced in this report
1228951 all of these costs were incurred at the clients direction and for the clients benefit
1228952 its incomprehensible that over 160 million more than half the value of the contract was squandered on overhead
1228953 parsons incurred billed and reported actual costs as directed by the government

1228974 the claustrophobic setting on the remote and from what i can tell fictional sandling island in the east of england adds to the atmosphere the mud the tide and the abandoned winter beach huts and boats are the background for a community where everyone lives a few minutes drive from everyone else and people know too much about each others lives the story is told without any special effects apart from the ubiquitous mobile phone which does not actually feature that much the book relies on good story telling rather than on any gadgetry and wizardry i defy anyone to put down losing you after the first hundred pages the intensity of ninas search as she jettisons her emotional interest in all the other aspects of her life is utterly compelling the real time setting works brilliantly as nina races to discover her daughters movements fully aware that the odds are increasingly against her
1228975 a fascinating read for anyone with an interest in the amazing world where science meets crime

1228998 all of these kids are very bright we need this kind of pathway to connect to these sorts of jobs many dont have a good idea of the opportunities in public health
1228999 i want to do something in science or the medical fields but im not sure what exactly this gives me the experience to make a decision
1229000 before i didnt realize all that researchers did this has opened my eyes to a lot of opportunities
1229001 im running tests on different drugs to see if they can relax the blood vessels of mice
1229002 this course shows me whats available in the medical field
1229003 this is a new experience on the river and its good to learn that the rivers are cleaner and healthier but also whats in the water

1229012 the lighthouse is the best building on the quays and we are delighted to welcome cbs outdoor

1229014 this is great news for the heart and the wider mediacity development
1229015 the market is very difficult at the moment so achieving so many sales without discounts on any demonstrates that the right product in the right location will always attract buyers the heart is high quality development within a very exciting area of the quays and its potential has been recognised by those wanting to be a part of one of the regions must have addresses
1229016 the risks are different and depend on what the drug is and what condition the person is in
1229017 taking speed cocaine ketamine ghb and mixing it with alcohol can make the situation much more dangerous
1229018 you have to remember there is no quality control on substances you may think you are taking one thing when in fact its something totally different and much more dangerous
1229019 drugs are pretty accessible to anyone if you can afford to go out drinking you can afford to buy drugs such as amphetamines and cocaine
1229020 its now spread across all levels of society middle class people are now just as likely if not more likely than those with less disposable income to be taking drugs
1229021 i know how cheap drugs are you can get a bag of speed for 10 to 15
1229022 its as cheap as chips you can buy ecstasy tablets for a few quid
1229023 if you can get drugs for the price of a round of drinks people particularly younger people will want to try them while ignorant of the dangers
1229024 this touches all of society you have a group of very middle class people in their 30s who thought they were having a good time they ended up having an extremely traumatic experience
1229025 its been horrendous what has happened to lose a friend like this
1229026 it has sent me into depression and i have asked to step down from my work i havent taken drugs since
1229027 i had taken drugs once or twice before i had taken speed and i had no idea the damage it could cause
1229028 you dont think after you have been drinking for hours i wish i had
1229029 i didnt realise the severity of drugs i had taken them a couple of times before i didnt know how serious they were i just thought they made you stay awake a little longer its been very traumatic and i wont take drugs again
1229030 it has been a long time coming and the fans have been great they were good at the semi final too there was a bit of over excitement and a bit of a scuffle that is regrettable but its a great result for us
1229031 apparently a bottle was thrown at todmorden fans and a scuffle started between two fans and everyone was charging around
1229032 the man operating the loudspeaker tried to calm things down by saying come on lads its not the time for fighting its a friendly game
1229033 the game was held up for a few minutes while a few lads were fighting the police arrived and it settled down
1229034 then accrington got a four and some of their fans ran on to the pitch and trouble flared up again something was thrown at the accrington fans
1229035 at the end of the match a police van turned up and officers were on the pitch in the stand and around the clubhouse to watch fans as accrington celebrated
1229036 police were called to the match to maintain a reassuring presence

1229039 i heard a thud and it took me a few moments to realise it was dad on the floor
1229040 he was in a really awkward position unconscious covered in blood and he wasnt breathing
1229041 fortunately my company had put me through a first aid course about a year back and that training just kicked in
1229042 we cleared his airways and i tried to revive him
1229043 the irish medical care has been fantastic but theres a bed for him at the ormskirk unit

1229049 wheeler makes clear he has no doubts about modern human induced climate change he said global warming is a reality but what our data shows is that climate science is complex and that it is wrong to take particular events and link them to co2 emissions
1229050 wheeler and his colleagues have since won european union funding to extend this research to 1750
1229051 manchester university has changed a lot in 40 years but one thing is constant the high quality of the people whether scientists or administrators they all impress me and my us colleagues with their acumen and they are true team players
1229052 battelle and the university will continue to have a very successful partnership long after i have left the scene because of the foundations established by the current team
1229053 receiving a copy of my thesis brought back heaps of memories
1229054 i recall building complex machines at the back of the metallurgy department in a special vibration free basement
1229055 i think the quality of life we enjoy in this region is great i think its far greater than london and the south east the people here are friendly and welcoming too weve recently moved and feel very settled already because we have got to know people quickly
1229056 no one likes commuting but its not as bad here as there weve got great diversity from the big cities to the lake district which i love
1229057 the motorway network and manchester airport is also important too you can fly anywhere from manchester and its a lot more pleasant there than heathrow
1229058 of course there are issues and it is clear that some peoples disposable incomes have been affected by this credit crunch and because of inflation
1229059 the consensus of opinion is that while there is clearly a downturn some businesses are suffering but its not anywhere near as bad as some would have you believe
1229060 i feel we need to include more women and ethnic minorities our membership is almost entirely white and middle class i think too the organisation would be more representative if we had some more members from the small and medium sized business community and from private equity
1229061 we spend a lot of time on national issues expressing our regions views to london the cbis lobbying role is the dominant part of what it does but it would be nice to be a bit more focused on the north west and issues here too
1229062 its surprising that it needs saying but business is the primary source for wealth creation and employment its a force for good but in some areas its not really seen that way
1229063 i think peoples knowledge of what happens in business is quite low and i think the media has an important role to play particularly now when theres so much gloom around the economy
1229064 the people were so welcoming and appreciative of what we were doing chief executive philip green organised the trip along with the charity water aid
1229065 it was a fascinating experience the people are extremely poor but the children were so happy despite this one lad had built a model of a car out of wood wire and sweetcorn husks it had a steering wheel that could be turned his ingenuity was remarkable and it made me think about how much we have
1229066 access is a major component in determining the future of our town and city centres more taxes on motorists mean that high street shops are less able to compete for trade against the larger retailers
1229067 the damage caused by various parking charges is done to the community as a whole because more money is taken out of the pockets of both consumers and local businesses
1229068 it has become a lot worse recently my sales have gone down by 25 per cent since the council took over the enforcement of parking
1229069 ive had people rushing past my shop saying they would love to come in but are worried they will get a ticket if they are a minute late its creating a culture where customers are scared away because they stand a good chance of having to pay out
1229070 this is not helping trade to flourish especially in the current economic downturn its a way for the council to rake in more money while stopping people enjoying the experience of shopping in a town like knutsford
1229071 the product range and network of distributors has grown significantly since the company began in 1992
1229072 hilly clothing has now become one of the leading manufacturers and suppliers of specialist running socks in the uk and the company is now exporting the range to several european markets
1229073 last year after moving to larger premises we decided that the company was at a crossroads and enlisted the help of knowledge to innovate in order to help us decide where to go next
1229074 we decided to develop some new socks and upgrade our existing range of accessories as well as introducing new colour options into our clothing range
1229075 k2i has helped us to see development as an ongoing process which we are now embedding into our company structure
1229076 we have also introduced a monthly team meeting and on the sales side we are looking at a number of new accounts to target
1229077 hilly is already a highly respected name in the running retail business but they needed some guidance as to which steps to take next in order to keep ahead of the field
1229078 our advisers presented them with a range of options and helped them to take a good look at the business assess future opportunities and develop an ongoing strategy for innovation in a number of business areas
1229079 there is a clear need for spaces where companies can co locate in order to facilitate collaboration innovation and share the costs of it and technical infrastructure

1229111 yeah its a good change of pace game from the usual shooter or action game i had rented virtua fighter and i absolutely hated it just something about the swords and weapons that does it for me and if youre a star wars fan its pretty awesome to play with vader and the apprentice which is a pain to beat in the arcade mode with vader cause hes so quick and counters everything you throw at him

1229205 you sure the needles not just moving because you just switched directions you know so that it points north
1229206 i want to go check on him but you saw what happened when he went in there
1229207 my friends and i did what are you doing here whats your name
1229208 not cool carl you know we all pretty much believe in this stuff preying on rich like that just not cool man
1229209 the ectoplasm sensor is going berserk ive never seen it this active before
1229210 you know out of all the places this woman cleans she manages not to clean under her bed and see this hole she doesnt need us she needs an exterminator
1229211 yeah if your definition of a ghost is a small rodent with large teeth rather than a supernatural ectoplasmic phenomenon
1229212 oh youve caught him havent you my reginald can finally rest in peace
1229213 this is what weve got he wanted us to tell you that he misses you
1229214 whats he doing out here shouldnt he be with his famly in azkaban
1229215 i reckon youre right why would they let a git like him loose
1229216 maybe he wasnt a threat maybe he was weak and they didnt fear him i dunno
1229217 execute the lot of em thats what they ought to do
1229218 whats he gonna do cale im pissing in my boots now
1229219 you two had best leave my pub now you dont want things getting messy
1229220 there isnt much going on up there right now anyway
1229221 harry you and i both know thats not true whats bothering you
1229222 i know i should be excited about the world cup its like a first step into a normal life if thats even possible but i cant help but thinking about the last time we went
1229223 no that was the year voldemort returned the year my scar began to hurt and the year cedric died and the year sirius
1229224 but thats all over now harry you did it you defeated him
1229225 i know but that doesnt make any of the memories easier you know
1229226 i do know the memories of my first year and the diary still live in my nightmares from time to time the thing is we just have to learn to live with our memories to live without letting them affect us its not always easy but you of all people can do it
1229227 im going to go see if ron and hermione are finished snogging and ready to go
1229228 first we need to make sure we all know where were going
1229229 so you two go first and ill side along apparate ginny
1229230 dont be shy harry youre as good as family now how are you
1229231 its a little odd but in a good way how are you doing
1229232 being the minister certainly comes with its share of work i can say though that im doing a lot better than when voldemort was still on the loose
1229233 i told the ministry i didnt need all this but they insisted upon it
1229234 oy try out this bed harry i could sleep for weeks on this thing
1229235 you should have told me earlier that you wanted to come see the tournament
1229236 ive had to waste some of my tickets entertaining some rather unpleasant diplomats im sure they wouldnt have minded missing the game if i had to give the tickets to the savior of the wizarding world
1229237 williams is sure doing a great job with team england huh
1229238 ron get off the bed and come in here if you want to talk to kingsley
1229239 but hell have his hands tied in the finals tonight against bulgaria viktor krum and the rest of the team are back with a vengeance after losing to ireland last time around
1229240 and the thing is the stadium isnt as big as it was the last time
1229241 considering that my nerves are wound tighter than a rubber band in anticipation of tonight
1229242 i have a once in a lifetime offer to make you
1229243 i know the members on team england would give their arms to meet you while i hope you dont require that sacrifice as i do want to have a standing chance at things i wanted to know if youd come and agree to meet the players in the locker room with me and after that you can spend the game on the sidelines
1229244 it would mean a lot to me harry gwenog jones is on the team and i would give anything to have a chance to talk to her but if youre not comfortable thats fine with me
1229245 theres to be no acknowledgement of my presence to the audience at least not officially im not your mascot
1229246 if someone like you can beat the dark lord then anythings possible
1229247 you guys go ill see you at the opening ceremony of the game
1229248 other than the fact that he is coaching the national team no ronald im not the one who would rather research quidditch statistics than snog
1229249 oy keep up with me i havent got all day
1229250 i cant believe youve never even heard of him though
1229251 hes only the most brilliant quidditch mind of our generation
1229252 weve got to keep anti apparition charms within twenty yards of the stadium we cant have just anyone gaining access to the locker room besides its good exercise
1229253 williams is most known for a couple things the exploding scoreboard that literally exploded whenever a chaser scored they had to sack that idea after some of the crowd was burned the great goat debacle
1229254 that was the twins favorite he actually put a goat on a broom and had it play chaser after a falcons game was out of hand and kept him in there until the game was over
1229255 hit right off the goats head and went into the hoop then there was jamal the ageless the greatest player of the 1800s williams signed him right when he began to manage the falcons and at the age of one hundred seventy three williams was both the oldest player to ever play a quidditch game and the only player to play in three centuries too bad a rogue bludger hit him in the head and killed him
1229256 stay here while i make sure the team is all decent
1229257 team id like to introduce the savior of the wizarding world harry potter
1229258 so i see youve made it pretty well in quidditch
1229259 come ill introduce you to the rest of the team
1229260 well yeah he did but the rules state that you have to have possession of the snitch for at least five seconds before the points are awarded
1229261 harry i just want to thank you for what you did today
1229262 i always do i wouldnt have made this into a publicity stunt anyway
1229263 ive seen you play at hogwarts when i paid my scouting visit there a few years ago and youve got plenty of natural skill if you want to play theres an open spot as the falcons seeker
1229264 thanks for the offer and all but its just not for me
1229265 alright thats your right i suppose i cant believe youre passing on whats everyones dream job though national attention championships all the girls one could want
1229266 and ive already got the only girl i want or need
1229267 and i have to thank you for everything all the attention couldnt be easy for you
1229268 im just stopping through i am allowed to walk where i want arent i potter
1229269 then id suggest you move i dont really need to see you and the weasel here eat each other whole i nearly lost my lunch
1229270 none of your business ive just seen the truth of the people you try to protect no wonder voldemort wanted to kill all of them
1229271 let it go harry the ferret isnt worth your time
1229272 what do you say we head back to the burrow
1229273 oh the poor boy why didnt we think of that before we started talking and right in front of him too well make no seating arrangements at all just like you told him
1229274 we have to keep him from being reminded of all those bad things weddings can be hard if someone you love cant be there
1229275 you do darling you take care of each other its a joy to watch the two of you together
1229276 i need to talk to you and winky can you come back when you have a moment
1229277 does this has to do with ginny pott ginny weasley
1229278 and by the way were getting married next summer at the burrow and it would really be great if you could make the wedding cake
1229279 winky will be harry and ginny potters house elf winky has noticed ginnys ring and the magical rubies
1229280 how did you know the rubies were magical no one else did
1229281 ive decided to enroll in an auror training program at the ministry of magic ill be starting i hope after christmas and i wont be able to run the inn so
1229282 so i asked stan to do it and he said yes
1229283 that is a good decision for harry potter to make
1229284 kreacher enjoys working with stanley shunpike he does not say bad things about house elves and he treats them kindly
1229285 winky must work for shan stunpike because harry potter says so
1229286 but harry potter must tell that one to stay out of winkys kitchen
1229287 stan shunpike has to come in here sometimes but it is your kitchen winky he knows that
1229288 testy i ope thats the worst of it dont worry arry she blows a lot of smoke but its mostly for show she just wants to run er kitchen the way she wants and thats fine with me
1229289 we had lunch and saw a play i was never at the theater before we had a good time
1229290 i understand youre signing up for the training program harry thats brilliant a lot of people were hoping youd do that
1229291 it was supposed to be a secret who told you
1229292 the first lesson youll learn is never to reveal your undercover sources
1229293 i have an idea who it was but i wont try to blow his cover
1229294 actually ron didnt say anything he took copies of lesson plans home with him on friday and it wasnt hard to figure out why but the news about you is all over the office im afraid
1229295 well id like to start after christmas but i wanted to talk to you before i made the decision official which it now seems to be
1229296 who do you think did all those things to the inn
1229297 well we know it was vagrants who tossed the weasel through the window and we have partial descriptions of the ones who knocked over the chimney and broke all the windows
1229298 thats not what i mean do you really think those vagrants if thats what they were could have planned all that and what about turquoise southeby and the slytherins who attacked those kids i just think theres a connection
1229299 theres no evidence for that harry theres not even any evidence to tie turquoise to anything i admit she looks suspicious very suspicious if you consider that shes disappeared look
1229300 i understand your frustration im frustrated too and so are saliyah and kingsley there is one thing that no one knows how to crack and thats probably the key to this whole thing the fidelius you discovered i guarantee you that well solve this when we break that fidelius
1229301 but what about all those death eaters who escaped from azkaban what about dolores umbridge
1229302 they might be involved i dont see what umbridge could have to do with this though shes still in france as far as we know
1229303 well im not assigned to that case so i dont really know that much
1229304 if theres one person out there who has a personal grudge against me its her damn
1229305 i appreciate everything the ministry is doing for me i just wonder if its enough
1229306 but were up against one of the strongest spells known to exist if you have an answer then please tell us
1229307 we just got here and i thought we could go meet ginny for lunch i havent been in the hogwarts library for a while and there are some books i want to look up in the restricted section
1229308 shell be pretty busy anyway i was just talking to sagittaria slocum and she said some things i didnt like come on we can go after lunch ill have winky serve it upstairs
1229309 unless the secret keeper turns up and tells us where the house is well never find it
1229310 then lets forget about the house what do you know about the death eaters and about umbridge
1229311 what about pansy parkinson did you ever find out anything about her
1229312 well no i didnt really try it did seem kind of far fetched to tie her in to all this
1229313 youre probably right so they havent caught any of the death eaters who escaped theyve lost track of umbridge and turquoise southeby has vanished why am i sensing that the office of magical law enforcement are a bunch of incompetents
1229314 there are other things happening besides your inn which you may have noticed is being protected by three aurors who do nothing but guard it if they werent doing that maybe they would be trying to solve crimes instead of just preventing them the office is also working on the turntongue case and theres probably other things going on that we dont know about on top of that kingsleys still acting head of the office and hes swamped maybe percys running it day to day but he has no formal training hes just a bureaucrat no offense
1229315 shes right harry percys good at what he does which is manage other quill pushers hes doing a good job with the training program but he doesnt teach anything himself
1229316 dont underestimate what its going to mean to the ministry of magic when
1229317 youre going to make a difference harry and from what ive seen of your magic lately i think that the ministry is going to be very pleased with what they get
1229318 but i dont see how that helps us now i dont want this thing hanging over my wedding im not going to let it affect that if the ministry cant do anything then its up to us
1229319 could there be anything in the restricted section that might help
1229320 ill tell you what harry give us lunch and then ill go look and we can surprise ginny
1229321 you are extremely lucky that i didnt have my wand in my hand
1229322 you would now be on your way to the hospital wing to have your bat bogeys removed
1229323 i wanted to look up some things in the restricted section
1229324 we were talking about the fidelius charm that turquoise southeby is using and we thought that maybe there would be something in here that we could use to break it
1229325 i had a talk with sagittaria slocum about the inn today
1229326 basically theyre sitting on their bums waiting for a solution to fall from the sky i want to solve this ginny i dont want it to be hanging around until next summer
1229327 harry i just had an idea you may not like it but maybe its the only thing we can do
1229328 we cant find turquoise and no ones going to attack the inn as long as the aurors are there what if the aurors went away maybe someone would attack the inn again
1229329 wait a minute these are patronuses were talking about not watch dogs how do you get a patronus to stand guard and be invisible
1229330 hermione how do you get a patronus to stand guard invisibly and then deliver a message when death eaters show up
1229331 you didnt know you sounded so sure i thought you knew
1229332 sorry love but my inspiration only goes so far i leave it to hermione to take it from there
1229333 its a brilliant idea all we have to do is figure out how to make it happen
1229334 youre in a good mood yes i will marry you
1229335 good lets go up to the headmistresss office i understand that shes like the captain of a ship she can marry people
1229336 then we have a problem i need to write a parchment for her class im afraid marriage is out
1229337 will you two shut up do you have any idea how annoying that is
1229338 this is a library not a common room please take your conversation out of here
1229339 you got us kicked out of the hogwarts library in my six years of skiving and slacking off i never once got tossed from the library
1229340 well have our answer to the patronus puzzle before dinner
1229341 i only got a chance to check one section of restricted stacks though theres a lot more there ill go back later
1229342 it sounded like a great idea maybe we can just go outside and try it
1229343 you know summon them and see if we can get them to stay in one place
1229344 remember dumbledore figured out how to use them as messengers which means that theres a way to modify their behavior we just have to find out how
1229345 can i persuade you to spend the last two hours of the weekend in the bedroom
1229346 that sounds like a wonderful way to pass the time
1229347 just before dennis made that second save all of a sudden you were there with me it felt really good
1229348 but this time it seemed like we were flying around the sky together what was it like down there
1229349 it was like wind blowing through my hair and my fingers freezing
1229350 i dropped them didnt you see i took them off to clap when dennis made his first save and i wasnt paying attention they almost hit jimmy on the way down
1229351 i never saw anyone do that except right after the battle
1229352 it took two muggle born witches with absolutely no prejudices
1229353 no one who grew up in the magical world would ever think of doing it they told me that sean and zoro would eat dinner at the gryffindor table tomorrow you are right it is a revolution
1229354 i guess so but it feels a little weird i was dating him and you were dating her
1229355 i dont have to remember that far back it was just last night
1229356 no my uncle in hong kong offered us jobs in his business well get married there
1229357 i always wanted to travel see things well take muggle boats and trains do a little sight seeing along the way
1229358 well you two will be the first of the da to leave us
1229359 well have a special toast for you how late are you staying
1229360 well catch me before you go ill make sure keesha gets everyones attention and well give you a proper send off
1229361 i always thought cho was a little mixed up i wonder what would have happened if cedric had lived
1229362 you still would have gotten detention for cursing malfoy and you still would have kissed me after the ravenclaw match
1229363 grawpies really glad yeh invited im harry an so am i its nice to be with family at christmas
1229364 dont worry about anything and dont come in until dinner time tomorrow if anyone shows up ill tell them were only serving bread and water
1229365 ive been looking at your green eyes all evening they do things to me you know
1229366 and that dress and that necklace do things to me
1229367 no but i thought he said something when he pointed his wand
1229368 hermione granger shes not working on that anymore she asked to be taken off as far as i know
1229369 we saw turquoise southeby and someone else they were both wearing hoods but southebys fell off and i saw her hair i tried to bind her but i missed then the second person came down the lane and took her hand and they disapparated
1229370 how did she get so close without setting off some kind of alarm
1229371 we dont have an alarm that goes off whenever someone comes near the inn if we did that every person who walked across this field would set it off we can tell when someones up to no good and apparently she was not
1229372 so if we didnt happen to be looking out the window she could still be standing here
1229373 theres no way for us to tell shes there if she does nothing
1229374 so theres nothing else to do out here i suppose
1229375 i guess we have to trust them but it sure would be
1229376 go home and enjoy your holiday ill look after things here
1229377 i dont mind at all i usually do something like this at christmas everyone gets a chance to spend time with their families i take off a different holiday thats all
1229378 ginny told us you were coming on the train we can all share a compartment
1229379 she was waiting for luna and keesha in the entrance hall
1229380 this is going to be fun well party all the way to london
1229381 but i wasnt sure if there was some kind of speaking order and i didnt want to go out of turn
1229382 i just wanted everyone to know that they hired a new defense against the dark arts teacher
1229383 i heard professor slughorn talking about it to madame sprout in the greenhouse this morning i dont know what he was doing there i never saw him there before it was highly unusual
1229384 luna how could he not say who it will be
1229385 ill ask ron and percy when i get home they know everything thats going on if i find out ill let you know
1229386 harry is the hero of the wizarding world and ginny is his girlfriend theyre engaged
1229387 but i hope you know that your daughters helped save my life did they tell you about it
1229388 were very happy and very proud for what they did by the way im george and this is my wife heather
1229389 weve heard so much about you two i hope the girls havent been a bother
1229390 we have to go my brothers waiting for us it was very nice meeting you
1229391 he was kind enough to help us get through to the platform it was good to meet you too
1229392 we have a ministry car and its supposed to be back in the garage by nine this evening
1229393 it was horrible i had no idea where you were or if i would ever see you again they had pulled luna off the train and she was gone we were all scared to death that they would arrest daddy any day and things were so bad at school that i wasnt sure if i wanted to go back
1229394 we were in godrics hollow freezing our bums off i was almost caught by his snake my wand broke and then riddle came within two seconds of murdering us
1229395 its absolutely amazing how happy i am ginny i love you so much

1229398 when we said we werent going to raise more capital we said we were adequately capitalised at that point in time
1229399 hello id like to vote for allen pp s 073 from the small dog gallery 3 in the perfect pooches contest he really is an amazing wiener dog thank you
1229400 ahem we want you to actually update your blog ms hyde
1229401 she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury you could tell she saw the truck at the last minute because her cellphone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet
1229402 a fixed meaning ascertainable through the usual devices familiar to those learned in the law
1229403 ambiguity was essential to its hopes of accumulating the broad based support needed for passage the amendment came close to succeeding only because both those who supported civil unions but not gay marriage and those who opposed civil unions along with gay marriage understood it to reflect their views
1229404 inherent nearly unavoidable feature of constitutional provisions addressing highly controversial subjects
1229405 originalist interpretation cannot keep its promise to limit judicial discretion in the very cases in which that discretion is most threatening
1229406 the original meaning of a constitutional provision is determined and constrained by the expectations of the framing generation as to how that provision would be applied to particular problems if the framers would have expected the constitution to permit something then it is permitted today and if they would have expected it to preclude something then it is precluded today
1229407 in ratifying the document the people appropriated it giving its text the meaning that was publicly understood
1229408 the original public understanding of the principle that was embodied in the text
1229409 what the original language actually meant to those who used the terms in question
1229410 the concern is no longer with how the words of the constitution were actually understood by the framers the ratifiers the public or anyone else but rather with how an objective hypothetical reader should have and likely would have understood them had he been fully informed
1229411 ive learned that no matter what happens or how bad it seems today life does go on and it will be better tomorrow
1229412 ive learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he she handles these three things a rainy day lost luggage and tangled christmas tree lights
1229413 ive learned that regardless of your relationship with your parents youll miss them when theyre gone from your life
1229414 ive learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance
1229415 ive learned that you shouldnt go through life with a catchers mitt on both hands you need to be able to throw some things back
1229416 ive learned that whenever i decide something with an open heart i usually make the right decision
1229417 ive learned that even when i have pains i dont have to be one
1229418 ive learned that every day you should reach out and touch someone people love a warm hug or just a friendly pat on the back
1229419 ive learned that i still have a lot to learn
1229420 ive learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel
1229421 este es el peor congreso que hemos tenido ha dado muestras de un enorme grado de corrupci n los casos que se han descubierto son varios y debe haber muchos m s eso es lo que le permite al gobierno manipular al congreso y no hay fiscalizaci n porque los congresistas est n buscando su inter s personal y son susceptibles a chantajes extorsiones y complicidades
1229422 la nica manera de que la situaci n mejore es que existan partidos pol ticos donde se eval en a los candidatos eso no existe ahora en el caso de upp est clar simo no es un partido simplemente un grupo de gente que se junta para utilizar la pol tica como manera de beneficiarse personalmente
1229423 esta ma ana lunes nos hemos reunido los congresistas del bloque y hemos decidido mantenernos en upp esto por un tema de principios y de defensa del partido y en la necesidad de consolidar la bancada como oposici n
1229424 seguiremos en upp como sabemos el reglamento del congreso no permite que existan parlamentarios de un mismo partido en dos bancadas diferentes
1229425 vamos a actuar como una sub bancada eso lo permite el reglamento del congreso el se or vega antonio piensa que el partido lo puede manejar igual que su casa estamos demandando que la mesa directiva cumpla lo que se ala en el reglamento
1229426 todo est listo para recibir a los dos mandatarios en tarija
1229427 para consolidar el acuerdo energ tico que tenemos con argentina
1229428 solicitamos una reestructuraci n al arbitraje peruano pedimos cambios otra de las medidas que tomaremos a partir de ma ana martes es no ir a entrenar a la villa deportiva nacional trabajaremos por nuestra cuenta en el estadio nacional
1229429 no permitamos que este se or siga en la conar haciendo da o al arbitraje y da ando la imagen de cada uno de nosotros nicolini no podr borrar lo que a dicho a los medios period sticos
1229430 si queremos seguir en la mediocridad dejaremos que esta comisi n contin e pero si buscamos el cambio apostemos por gente capacitada
1229431 nicolini no sabe respetar a la persona y no debe seguir porque l no es quien para borrar a un rbitro
1229432 siento que a n no acabo mi ciclo en el arbitraje a n tengo once a os m s en la carrera profesional y nadie puede venirme a sacar ante todo debe prevalecer la dignidad y los valores por encima de todo
1229433 despu s de eso dice que nunca consigui tener relaci n con una persona que ni siente ganas
1229434 la nica soluci n fue orientar a los ganaderos a que no dejaran los animales en pastos cerca de la carretera
1229435 pudimos controlar a universitario en lima ahora trataremos de aprovechar sus debilidades
1229436 tuve un equipo aplicado ordenado y eso fue una de las razones para poder sacar el cero a cero
1229437 en la parte ofensiva nos falt llegar con mayor fuerza
1229438 el partido del mi rcoles ya es historia ahora tenemos que salir a ganar y punto ser dif cil pero estamos codificados para salir a buscar la clasificaci n
1229439 son las mismas comisiones que tenemos no creo que haya cambios vamos a ver que plantean los grupos
1229440 en principio cada grupo se quedar con las comisiones que ha venido presidiendo salvo que haya un caso excepcional en donde se plantee un tema muy puntual
1229441 ya termin la sesi n el texto lo pueden dar a conocer hoy lunes o ma ana o los pr ximos d as con toda seguridad pienso s habr una rectificaci n hay que esperar y creo que los resultados ser n positivos
1229442 he visto que hay una predisposici n de los integrantes de la corte luego de escuchar nuestra exposici n ellos entienden claramente que tenemos mucha raz n al sentirnos ofendidos por el contexto de la sentencia
1229443 ellos saben que los responsables en este caso son los terroristas y no el estado
1229444 la cantidad de personas que contin a muriendo a causa del sida es terrible
1229445 necesitamos ver los xitos y las fallas en las propuestas locales para luego llevar ese conocimiento y compartirlo a nivel global
1229446 muchas veces los j venes no son incluidos pero sin ellos no hay xito
1229447 la mejor manera de apoyar los ni os es manteniendo a sus padres vivos y saludables
1229448 crap i have fifty half started blog entries i never finished
1229449 my goodness what on earth does this child do for

1229452 with this type of learning you cant teach it without first doing it yourself messing up getting stuck coming back to it and trying it again before you get it right

1229456 the survey shows quite startlingly that the impact of slowing domestic demand is starting to take its toll on australian business accis director of industry policy and economics greg evans said in canberra
1229457 encouragingly on the inflation front both wage and non wage costs have indeed moderated as have business input prices he said
1229458 acci considers moderation in wage and non wage growth as well as declining business confidence and profit growth reduce the possibility of a wage price inflation spiral despite headline inflation hitting a 13 year high of 4 5 per cent in the year to june mr evans said
1229459 given the notable slowing in growth acci considers that an interest rate cut should be considered as early as possible
1229460 eighty one million tonnes of co2 abatement each year by 2020 is around 20 per cent of australias total carbon abatement targets

1229463 chainsaws and bulldozers for the entirely unnecessary export woodchip industry

1229466 were already spending the money to build a brilliant new international stadium and a multi purpose sports facility
1229467 were already building a replacement for this facility here with basketball capacity a netball centre and a rugby centre
1229468 if john coates believes its possible then i think we can make a very serious play for this
1229469 i think people understand that these bids are very competitive wed be up against very big players internationally
1229470 but frankly in 15 to 20 years time i think well be more than up for it
1229471 what is in australias favour is that the sydney games were very successful

1229475 the police investigation in the early period following ms childs death unfortunately did not capture some items of evidence which are no longer available to the current investigating police

1229478 it is imperative that bill deweese resign as majority leader
1229479 as the democratic leader he should take responsibility and resign
1229480 i am saddened that josh would take this public shot at me
1229481 technically hes not a part of leadership but he is the symbolic head of the reform movement so his comments carry weight
1229482 will be a terrible distraction for democrats in the fall when we have serious issues to deal with such as health care transportation and the poor economy mr yudichak said
1229483 it would have been more appropriate for josh to request or if he feels that strongly demand for leaders to bring the caucus together on this issue in private

1229510 on a difficult question the majority is unlikely to be correct
1229511 theres a lot of people saying will they wont they has it failed has it succeeded
1229512 it was always a trial and a trial is by its nature a trial to see whether it works to see whether its succeeded to see whether its changed behaviours
1229513 but the lockout was one part of a number of strategies weve got in place

1229523 the asian american civic project was created to expand the pipeline for asian americans to enter careers in politics we all know that asian americans face unique cultural and economic barriers to pursuing careers in politics the barriers to entry are just too high for many who have the desire but lack the proper knowledge and resources
1229524 breaking into politics is not an easy or obvious process but the civic project will hopefully change the calculus for asian american youth and their families by providing training and funding to work on a campaign for three months through election day 2008 following the election the civic project will then provide professional development resources to help the campaign fellows find their next job
1229525 am i the only one who thinks xandros buying linspire was a good move
1229526 the exciting part of this study is that we have discovered a completely new process that regulates the adverse responses to bad memories
1229527 these findings can help the development of new drugs to treat conditions in which people are haunted by persistent fears such as post traumatic stress disorder or other panic disorders
1229528 but thoughtless and ill considered it seems so easy to you only because you do not know life there are many things that seem to us good but the execution of what is good is complicated and dif cult it is hard enough to walk well on a beaten track but it is harder still to lay out a new one new paths are made only by men who are thoroughly mature and have mastered all that is attainable by man it seems to you easy to make new paths of life only because you do not yet understand life it is an outcome of thoughtlessness and youthful pride we old folk are needed to moderate your impulsiveness and guide you by our experience and you young folk should obey us in order to pro t by that experience your active life lies before you you are now growing up and developing finish your education make yourself thoroughly conversant with things get on to your own feet have rm convictions of your own and then start a new life if you feel you have strength to do so but for the present you should obey those who are guiding you for your own good and not try to open up new paths of life

1229530 all i say is that my family should not be brought up in

1229538 taking a long term perspective on ecosystem services highlights tradeoffs among services and points to the level at which management actions will be effective
1229539 its important to keep these tradeoffs in mind in order to develop realistic management goals
1229540 we often wring our hands trying to figure out how to put values on ecosystem services
1229541 we hope policy makers will take notice that there are costs associated with these economic activities that havent been accounted for previously
1229542 ecosystem services projects are far more likely to engage a wider variety of stakeholders drawing in private agricultural landowners and engaging funds from sources such as private corporations

1229550 quiero creer que se trata de una estrategia de negociaci n del gobierno pero igualmente los funcionarios deber an ponerse de acuerdo para dar una respuesta a los trabajadores edmundo jim nez es el responsable de las negociaciones pol ticas los gremios trabajamos con l en materia salarial con jorge jim nez no tenemos ni siquiera di logo
1229551 uno hace de polic a bueno y el otro de polic a malo para negociar en mejor situaci n pero entiendo que hay un manoseo por parte del gobierno si hubiera una verdadera voluntad de di logo se abrir a la convocatoria a todos los sectores ya estamos grandes para que nos subestimen

1229590 we believe aafia has been in custody ever since she disappeared and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence

1229592 i got a chance to beat the best man in the world and i came up just a touch short but i think i had him a little scared once which was great he just said great fight to me and that makes it a little better i think

1229594 ive been asking linux folks what ui toolkit oo uses but so far i have not received a convincing answer what toolkit is it
1229595 it would be interesting to do the test with the ooo build patch set http www go oo org which is used by default by novell suse red hat fedora mandriva debian ubuntu etc they are claiming better performance than the standard sun version
1229596 and people can really relate to that because anyone growing up who got picked on either theyre too tall too short had crooked teeth doesnt matter what it is they see he is a victim of society society has kind of rejected him and hes accepted it and wants to be left alone and now theyve come in on him and invaded his area and now hes fighting back so its almost kind of like yeah i wish i could do that my boss is a jerk face i cant do that but jason can do that and they can kind live through him in a fantasy sort of way
1229597 hes not accepted hes the outcast and a lot of people in different aspects of their personality can relate to that
1229598 i wanted to develop a character that would help anakin settle down
1229599 at the end of episode ii anakins kind of a wild child and he and obi wan dont get along so the idea was to see how they become friends how they become partners how they become a team and one of the ways to do that because when you become a parent when you become a teacher you have to sort of become more responsible you know it forces you into this adulthood thing so what i wanted to do was take anakin and force him into this kind of now i have to teach somebody now i have to be slightly more responsible
1229600 i happen to have a couple daughters so i have a lot of experience with that particular situation
1229601 and i said rather than making it another guy why dont we make her a girl because thats fun and i have a lot of girls and theyre just as hard to deal with when theyre teenagers as boys are
1229602 there was the idea that maybe the sith apprenticed a new one after darth maul and that she would be a girl

1229605 tim burton would have killed me if i hadnt done it because hes such a terminator fan

1229607 i had a plan all along an epic story arc that really does wrap up
1229608 its very exhilarating to see it all tied up in a big climax and resolution like running a very long marathon im raising my hands for a victory lap but also feeling sad to have it all over
1229609 hes the leader of an alien empire that is at first kindly toward humanity falls in love with a human woman but then finds himself trapped by politics so that he is forced to betray the human race in order to save his own
1229610 everything is intertwined one race clashing with another and nothing is totally black and evil
1229611 im already diving headfirst into my next big project an innovative fantasy trilogy called terra incognita and brian herbert and i have an original sf series called hellhole a few years from now i might want to go back to the seven suns universe with a new storyline maybe revisit some of the old characters but it would be completely stand alone not an oh wait i need to do another sequel type of project
1229612 i like a canvas where theres room to paint whole cultures and ages long conflicts
1229613 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1229614 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1229615 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1229616 and if they dont we should require them to give up their leases to someone who will
1229617 is there for a purpose to help americans in times of crisis

1229620 consistent about his belief that the president should retain his discretionary authority to conduct exchanges or swaps
1229621 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire
1229622 there is nothing happening immediately but in the next couple of years i will definitely go back and forth from here to the us more often
1229623 were a bit like the spice girls weve got the dreamy one the sensitive one everyone in the audience has their favourite im the loyal one which i guess is a little bit similar to me
1229624 im kind of honoured because the message of the show is that it doesnt matter what you believe were one family all connected
1229625 its so cleverly written some people come and think were celebrating god which we are and others come and think were poking a big stick at religion which we are as well i hope people will question the things they live by after the show we get a lot of people who are moved by it it wont offend you unless youre walking in ready to be offended
1229626 the routines of so you think you can dance singing like australian idol plus portraying your character so its a one and a half hour marathon of performing arts not to mention the audience participation
1229627 its fun picking out the people who havent been saved yet
1229628 our goal is to save the souls of the audience one fan at a time and bring that number to zero by the end of the concert the number changes every night
1229629 its great having different hats to choose from and i swing between the two when i realise im getting all stuck into my ego and caring what people think of me its nice to disappear and go back behind the scenes
1229630 its no secret that there always has been a little bit of tension in the band but at the moment there is nothing to tell

1229642 su negativa a condenar los atentados est el apoyo a etarras y la asunci n de los esl ganes de la banda
1229643 las palabras de solbes no ayudan a conseguir un acuerdo suponen un nuevo rev s al estatut

1229647 el efecto m s doloroso de la crisis por la que atraviesa la econom a espa ola es el crecimiento del paro
1229648 el mercado laboral tiene todav a un margen amplio para empeorar
1229649 una impresi n clara de la magnitud de la quiebra del empleo
1229650 que la industria y los servicios aguanten el tipo no evitar el empeoramiento grave en el mercado laboral al menos en lo que queda de 2008 y primavera de 2009
1229651 la actividad del ladrillo se aproxima a la recesi n
1229652 hay muchas probabilidades de que las proyecciones del gobierno se queden cortas
1229653 el impacto del paro va a ser intenso probablemente barrer las escasas posibilidades de equilibrio fiscal durante 2008 y 2009 y obliga desde ahora a pensar en medidas m s dr sticas de las que se han tomado hasta el momento para recuperar la demanda
1229654 no es por casualidad que la confianza del consumidor descendiera 5 4 puntos en julio respecto al mes anterior
1229655 la situaci n econ mica como corroboran los ltimos datos del cis es tan negativa como la respuesta del gobierno ante una situaci n que no admite trampas sem nticas
1229656 las cifras no admiten interpretaciones sesgadas porque los n meros no son m s que el reflejo de una dolencia cr nica de un mercado laboral anquilosado
1229657 se est destruyendo empleo a pasos agigantados pero no s lo es el paro sino el ipc la brusca ca da del crecimiento la dilapidaci n del super vit del estado o el d ficit por cuenta corriente
1229658 la situaci n es peor de la que preve amos todos ha sentenciado solbes

1229660 hay que presionar a los que se quedan sin empleo para que no agoten el periodo de prestaci n y se preparen activamente para acceder a otro puesto
1229661 otro dato llamativo poco congruente en periodo estival es el anormal aumento del paro en el sector servicios durante julio
1229662 la explicaci n que se da desde hace a os sin que la administraci n act e en consecuencia est en las trampas consentidas a las empresarios que fingen cerrar en verano env an a sus empelados a cobrar el subsidio y reabren en septiembre
1229663 quiebra la tendencia de un mes propicio para las contrataciones temporales y ensombrece a n m s un panorama econ mico hu rfano de estad sticas que alivien la inquietud de la sociedad
1229664 tambi n es el indicador que mejor refleja la profundidad de la crisis
1229665 en el decepcionante contexto nacional la afirmaci n del vicepresidente solbes de que la aspiraci n de alcanzar el pleno empleo respond a m s a una ambici n del programa electoral del psoe que a una an lisis t cnico realista trasluce tanta frustraci n con impotencia
1229666 cinco activistas de eta han quedado libres por motivos de salud casi triviales y en absoluto graves
1229667 estas actuaciones judiciales que probablemente est n s lidamente sustentadas no s lo no amainan la inquietud social por las circunstancias del caso de juana sino que agravan la preocupaci n por lo que supone un trato ciertamente incomprensible hacia los miembros de una banda terrorista que ha causado tanto dolor y que amenaza la seguridad de los espa oles
1229668 la investigaci n para tratar de determinar si de juana incurri en enaltecimiento del terrorismo por el contenido de la carta que se ley en su nombre el pasado s bado en san sebasti n se enmarca en las facultades con que cuenta el estado de derecho para perseguir aquellas conductas que puedan coadyuvar a la violencia de eta y menospreciar a las v ctimas
1229669 es precisamente su nueva condici n de hombre libre la que le obliga a ce ir su actuaci n a los m rgenes previstos
1229670 el silencio del gobierno de ibarretxe ante la nueva controversia generada por la libertad de de juana resulta demasiado audible frente a la impune demostraci n de insensibilidad
1229671 aqu la nica presi n es la ley que hay que cumplir tanto cuando permite que se deje en libertad a un criminal irredento cuando avala que se le pueda devolver a prisi n por enaltecer el terrorismo

1229681 la realidad es que pese a lo espectacular de la fachadas de la china de hu jintao ha incumplido sus promesas de que la adjudicaci n de los juegos redundar a en un avance de la causa de los derechos humanos
1229682 china que va a estar bajo la lupa desde el viernes s lo puede reclamar de los observadores objetividad y buena voluntad no que tengan los ojos cerrados a la realidad
1229683 s lo ha hecho falta un acontecimiento planetario como los juegos ol mpicos para que un pa s tradicionalmente aislado como china se haya visto sumido en un torbellino de violencia que no distingue entre oriente y occidente ni entre democracia y reg menes de partido nico
1229684 una consecuencia seria ser a que el r gimen tan habituado a la brutalidad con sus enemigos internos se pusiera a la altura de los criminales y eligiese m todos intolerables para combatirlos

1229703 i dont know that there is any horse his equal right now and i loved to match big brown

1229709 im a fighter who has a good following in new york and i want to be here fighting in front of my fans i can guarantee that every fight im in is going to be exciting i dont like watching boring fights on tv and i dont like being in boring fights
1229710 irish ropes has one fighter in john duddy and he hasnt been able to fight on hbo
1229711 i knew he had a second career to fall back on
1229712 one day he could turn around and just quit but the way hes been training for this fight and the way he portrays himself and all the attention he is getting from his fans i know hes going to stay in the game i know he wants it

1229727 buying presents to impress women has been a key part of mating rituals in humans for some time but it appears that it is the act of generosity rather than the gift itself which is being used as a mating signal
1229728 we have found in previous studies that women are attracted to generous men they seem to like heroic types for short term relationships but altruists for long term relationships
1229729 generosity could be a way for men to show their suitability to invest in a relationship and help in rearing offspring
1229730 across human societies very public acts of generosity such as philanthropy bystander intervention and heroism at war are primarily male activities
1229731 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1229732 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1229733 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1229734 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1229735 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined
1229736 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1229755 but our sense of community is very much in the quaker tradition were not an ivory tower we want students to be responsible global citizens
1229756 one underlying theme here is our interest in reconnecting ourselves with the community and putting an emphasis on serving as a resource for them after 200 years we want to announce to the community that weve been here and will continue to be here
1229757 all elected officials have a sacred right to vote our conscience every single vote i have taken is for the kids

1229768 mensen kijken naar de marktkramen of praten met elkaar en letten niet op het niveauverschil
1229769 bovendien valt het niveauverschil niet op het is grijs op grijs twee weken geleden waren er zelfs vier valpartijen in een dag de regen maakte het extra gevaarlijk mensen worden vaak met de ambulance afgevoerd aan de zijde van de maria pijpelincxstraat reed een vrouw met haar rolstoel van het trapje ondertussen is het probleem daar opgelost door een kraam te verschuiven

1229774 we krijgen van het stadsbestuur geen toelating meer om een historische optocht te organiseren
1229775 het stadsbestuur heeft geen interesse voor de eigen streekcultuur de afgelopen jaren daalde het enthousiasme van het schepencollege voor onze gildenfeesten alleen tijdens de verkiezingen duiken ze allemaal weer op toch ontvangen wij en de dienst toerisme veel vragen naar onze stoet

1229780 patient safety is our number one concern we will continue to work with our physicians and staff to notify patients of any changes or further suspension of services as soon as the information becomes available
1229781 we are taking extensive measures to ensure that all patients are cared for safely while at the same time limiting any inconvenience for those patients who need to be rescheduled
1229782 hospital equipment and areas such as surgical suites must operate at a certain temperature level and humidity rate to maintain efficiency and infection control standards the hospital has put into effect its emergency management plan and is currently dedicating a team of professionals to ensure that all standards are being met and patients are receiving quality care

1229795 according to the autopsy surgeon her sex organs indicated female trouble
1229796 she would then refuse to have sexual intercourse by telling them she was a virgin or that she was engaged or married there were three known men who did have sexual intercourse with her and according to them she got no pleasure out of this act
1229797 i tried just about everything then the last thing we tried seemed to work well it turned around in about three or four days

1229807 we prefer to get massachusetts news instead of rhode island news
1229808 we looked at what was in the best interest of our customers
1229809 there are some customers who really want just that boston fox news but for the most part people want a full programming lineup on the channels they pay for
1229810 we would encourage westport residents to contact their local cable company and let them know they would like to continue receiving fox 25
1229811 they like to spear bright shiny things like your eyes
1229812 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1229813 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1229814 we have made some concessions including agreeing to postpone the elections and we have shown flexibility on this

1229816 have not shown any flexibility and they are not interested in reaching any deals

1229822 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1229823 it becomes its not just our union it becomes a political message theyre trying to get out
1229824 if i had my preference i wouldnt bring politics into it but we just cant lose the moment and the opportunity when so many friends and family are together
1229825 but we have to do double duty theres no other choice
1229826 i couldnt bear the thought of getting more things to dust in our home
1229827 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1229828 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples
1229829 and so far none of our blood relatives or straight friends have actually contributed any money
1229830 we dont need another toaster or another set of silverware
1229831 so we thought wed have people who want to celebrate with a gift do that with these two institutions
1229832 the very fact that we can get married to some people is a political act
1229833 i have never lived in one place as long as i have here
1229834 working in a converted dairy barn on our property is a dream come true for me
1229835 i know when i see a painting i will do in the countryside
1229836 i bring those emotions back to my studio to create images
1229837 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
1229838 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year
1229839 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
1229840 they amp squo ve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends amp squo
1229841 the word we heard used most to describe the pirates return in these two trades was quantity which isnt always a compliment
1229842 he told me i was going to love pittsburgh that it was just right for me
1229843 he lived in our house almost 1 1 2 years before i could get him to drop sir
1229844 you would have thought he had won the world series
1229845 its not like i was sitting there in pawtucket saying hey i should be playing ahead of manny or j d but you go from an organization where youre thinking man one day at best if i stick around here im going to be a fourth outfielder and all of a sudden you play every day its almost too perfect
1229846 my familys pretty religious so my wife and i said a prayer left it up to god the next day it happened
1229847 im probably not going to hit 30 but ive heard the ballpark in pittsburgh is deep in left center never been there and thats great for me thats where all my doubles go
1229848 wow i dont even know what to say to that
1229849 as far as bay goes i only have heard great things about him but im not going to try to be bay or bonds or anyone else im just going to be me and ill play hard for you if i didnt id have a phone call from my father telling me about it thats how i was raised
1229850 well look at this for two three days and see where we are
1229851 impairments to the liver kidney brain bones pineal gland thyroid and even teeth trump the paltry if not outright questionable benefits to teeth be considered a health benefit
1229852 careful bonafide laboratory experimentation by conscientious patriotic research chemists and actual medical experience have both revealed that instead of preserving or promoting dental health fluoridated drinking water destroys teeth before adulthood and after by the destructive mottling and other pathological conditions it actually causes in them and also creates many other very grave pathological conditions in the internal organisms of bodies consuming it
1229853 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit
1229854 our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health our keynote speaker dr a k susheela executive director fluorosis research and rural development foundation india probably knows more about fluorides toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist it is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say
1229855 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
1229856 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
1229857 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1229858 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1229859 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
1229860 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
1229861 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1229862 it was an incredible moment when we realized the figures we were getting in they had not been previously recorded because these are very remote areas that are quite inaccessible and logistically tough to survey
1229863 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1229864 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1229865 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live
1229866 would have prevented danieals appalling death by merely doing their jobs as spelled out in the policy manual
1229867 the fact that so many workers failed danieal however speaks to a larger problem than some profoundly negligent dhs employees it reveals an agency that is broken
1229868 theres not a shadow of doubt in my mind that this department will turn around
1229869 if she would not have had that vision test i would never have known
1229870 im so relieved and going to make sure i do everything they tell me to make sure this works for her for life
1229871 how this lens is going to work in a childs eye we dont know weve never done studies

1229873 youve got declining home prices very tight credit conditions a soft jobs market and a weak stock market the consumer has got a lot to deal with
1229874 the rebates are not translating into anywhere near the spending impulse that congress and the administration had hoped for
1229875 under these circumstances the economy remains in very fragile condition
1229876 fuerbringer was a striking figure a man of presence and he held power decisively and did not encourage dissent
1229877 he was the most controversial man within time magazine immensely influential perhaps the most influential conservative of his generation in journalism but outside the magazine almost no one knew his name
1229878 he was very open to the cultural trends of the time and making sure time magazine wrote about them
1229879 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1229880 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1229881 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1229882 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1229883 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1229884 saddened at the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack and extend our condolences to the victims and their families
1229885 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the chinese government has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1229886 this time they actually managed to carry out their plan but it will not affect the olympics greatly
1229887 the threat from east turkestan forces exist but their capabilities are limited
