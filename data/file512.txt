5120001 consequently no agency is responsible for determining the risks associated with the proliferation of these labs
5120002 nobody is checking to see if people being approved to work with anthrax or other biological agents actually have the scientific skills to work with it

5120017 how long do you think youll have to wait now
5120018 dont let it worry you just yet it could be a while
5120019 but i am worried i mean what if something happens to you
5120020 whats going to happen to me the worst that can happen is that they throw me straight back in here
5120021 well dont worry about me okay you need to be more worried about yourself once youre in here alone
5120022 youre listening to me right you know better than i do how dangerous some of the girls in here are theyll eat you alive given half the chance some of them literally
5120023 go wash your face and use the toilet if you need to
5120024 hey dont look at me like that fujimoto ive given you guys an extra three minutes out here with your buddies
5120025 oh dear have a bit of an accident did we
5120026 i have found my niche and will continue to work with children with challenging behaviours
5120027 its looking for those positives and building on those positives
5120028 the skills they need to successfully negotiate their way through school
5120029 some students just seem to innately know what is required to participate successfully in social or school situations but some need more specific support
5120030 if a child is displaying challenging behaviour and has been for a long time the parent may require additional support it is unlikely that the child is only experiencing difficulty in a school setting
5120031 the more follow up at school and at home the more likely the student is to have a successful return to school
5120032 i just kept telling myself i could do it and it was an unbelievable feeling today
5120033 just a great way to end whats going to be an even better week tomorrow
5120034 it was that kind of week where i had nothing to lose kind of a win win whether i play great and move on to next week or obviously sometimes theres more important things in life than playing golf
5120035 ive been out here a long time and ive had success but this has been kind of a rough year hopefully this will really turn it around im looking forward to playing a lot this fall and maybe trying to give it a run the next couple of weeks as well
5120036 this is kind of the same premise but right now its totally different because i wasnt even in the playoffs
5120037 i had to fight like hell just to get in the playoffs for me right now i think this is actually a little bit more gratifying to actually make it
5120038 now i can use this as a stepping stone to try to do something a little better going into the playoffs certainly im playing well and my confidence is there so im going to keep working at it and who knows
5120039 i knew i had to play my butt off just to make it up there
5120040 i didnt want to have four weeks off and im glad at least i got into the first one ive got a chance for the first one and second one so on and so forth im there now
5120041 obviously to do it its good i guess right now i am 122 so have a good week next week and ill be in a couple more that was my no 1 goal and i got it
5120042 for too long the u s mint has catered to white middle aged men
5120043 the u s mint serves all americans and we want to make it accessible for everyone including all ethnicities and women
5120044 an international security mission should be deployed to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home and international organizations should also send fact finding missions to establish the facts report on human rights and urge the authorities to account for any crimes
5120045 on august 9 or 10 massive bombing started and the village administration building and a hospital building were destroyed bombing took place day and night it looked like they were targeting big buildings that could be housing the georgian military
5120046 during the bombing on august 9 my uncles neighbor was killed my uncle buried him in his backyard
5120047 we had to walk through the woods to gori district villages and then our military helped us to evacuate when we were walking through the woods the bombing continued i had to lie in swamps and crawl for hours i was afraid to get up
5120048 there were five people in our car suddenly there was an explosion perhaps four or five cars were hit i saw that people were injured and killed there was blood
5120049 there were many wounded i had to decide who had better chances of survival and stuff them into the ambulance we buried the dead in the yards and fled the village
5120050 any comprehensive investigation takes time but we continue to gather information that points to indiscriminate attacks by georgias forces
5120051 during the shelling a grad rocket hit the house setting the roof on fire my father went outside to try to put out the flames and at that moment another rocket hit he was wounded in his thigh by a piece of shrapnel our mother dragged him to the basement and spent several hours trying to stop the bleeding but she had nothing to bandage the wound with he slowly bled to death in her arms
5120052 we all rushed to the basement but an elderly man some 80 years old who lived on the fourth floor didnt manage to make it to the basement in time his apartment was hit by a shell and caught fire when the attack was over we went upstairs and saw that the old man burned to ashes we buried his remains in the yard
5120053 have you been here the whole time during the shelling and everything we thought the civilians had all fled
5120054 gaki san youre scaring me tell me what it is

5120067 theres a lot of photographers now who are using software to manipulate landscape imagery but at this stage im not changing my images
5120068 but it has started me thinking about where i might go with it in the future
5120069 i still like it to be realistic thats my personal preference but i do think theres scope to go into the art area too
5120070 i really felt the print on the parchment style paper was worthy so i was glad that it was awarded
5120071 the other one browns mountain the light in that was amazing
5120072 i also entered a black and white image and just missed out with that
5120073 i prefer using the large format cameras where great time and care is taken with composition lighting and exposure
5120074 i had been painting portraits of other peoples bodies for an exhibition at shoalhaven city arts centre called gender agenda so my studio was full of portraits of other naked or semi naked people
5120075 it was very much a photograph that reflected the year i had
5120076 i think its important to remember your photograph has to tell the story
5120077 my photo is a metaphor for the existence of an exhibiting artist in a way
5120078 putting your work and your vulnerability up there for all to see
5120079 this is good to see that the local builders developers and architects are able to submit such varied and substantial building and design projects in the city
5120080 council supports these awards and works with the major sponsors to ensure that the building and design industry in the city is vibrant and constantly looking for new challenges
5120081 fuck you fuck you fuck you and all weve been through i said leave it leave it leave it theres nothing in you and did you hate me hate me hate me hate me so good that you just let me out let me out let me out of this hell when youre around let me out let me out let me out hell when youre around let me out let me out let me out

5120128 semasa saya mula bekerja pada tahun 1992 dahulu seramai 52 penoreh tempatan bekerja di sini tetapi kerana bayaran yang diterima tidak setimpal menyebabkan mereka berhenti kerja
5120129 penoreh tempatan tidak dapat memberikan tumpuan sepenuhnya untuk mendapatkan hasil getah yang banyak kerana masing masing terikat dengan hubungan komuniti tetapi penoreh asing pula hanya memberikan masa dan tumpuan yang sepenuhnya untuk mendapatkan hasil yang lumayan
5120130 sudah 25 tahun kami berniaga di sini dan kami tidak akan berpindah kerana tempat ini adalah sumber rezeki kami untuk membesarkan anak anak
5120131 walaupun kawasan ini agak terasing dari jalan utama namun ini adalah kawasan pelancongan terkenal port dickson dan setiap minggu ia adalah tumpuan pelancongan
5120132 pembangunan sebegini adalah tidak adil kerana bilangan kami adalah lebih ramai berbanding kemudahan premis yang bakal disediakan kami juga terpaksa memohon kembali berniaga di gerai tersebut malah bukan sahaja akan bersaing sesama sendiri tetapi bersaing dengan orang luar
5120133 kami pernah menghubungi wakil rakyat kawasan ini untuk mengadu masalah ini tetapi tiada sebarang tindakan dan lebih mengejutkan kami beliau menyuruh kami menyelesaikan masalah ini sendiri

5120139 never ever give a lender a reason to say anything bad about you to the credit bureaus
5120140 dont ever use your credit report as a 10 percent off coupon at the mall
5120141 you should have as many cards as you need to operate efficiently
5120142 negative information by law for the most part cannot stay on your credit report for more than seven years

5120145 she bleeds red white and blue but its basketball shes a great player
5120146 this week has been fantastic this feels like home for me
5120147 by doing this ive been sent away from the in group for starcraft 2 and lots of others pretty lame would have made more sense to go with nvidia because i believe its used more widely by players
5120148 ive got plenty of time for world records in the future
5120149 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5120150 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5120151 i kind of felt like i let the tournament slip away on 10 and 11
5120152 i told myself on the next tee box i got my momentum
5120153 finally feel like you got one back on that hole
5120154 it will be a great satisfaction just to think about you know pulled it off and did it and its a wonderful feeling
5120155 doesnt happen that often in golf unless youre tiger woods
5120156 second place is obviously tough to swallow right now but ill probably be pretty happy here when i realize ive got a job for the rest of the year
5120157 i knew i had to play my butt off just to make it up there
5120158 i didnt want to have four weeks off you know and im glad at least i got into the first one
5120159 yes of course st fama and st french say so
5120160 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate
5120161 i thought i saw where heating was supposed to go up and you know when youre on a limited income its pretty hard
5120162 its enough just to get by as it is let alone if they raise it
5120163 bills will almost certainly be considerably higher than they were last year
5120164 we pass our costs on dollar for dollar to our customers
5120165 any instability in the oil supply could have a psychological impact
5120166 a lot of the electricity plants burn natural gas when its cooler than normal the peak load isnt needed and decreases demand
5120167 we get increases not just because of higher gas rates but because of a lack of jobs
5120168 the natural gas prices being higher affects our clients a lot of them dont live in energy efficient homes
5120169 id survive and pay it but i would have less for something else
5120170 i dont look at this levy as something new to the community
5120171 its a renewal its nothing new as far as taxes it has no impact with the situation that has arisen with the dream project thats an isolated situation the board has their opinion and the person contributing to the project has his opinion
5120172 no one in the community should get sidetracked by those issues
5120173 we need to push this as hard as we can push this
5120174 theres going to be a large turnout we need as many people on board and we need as many school administrators teachers to have a positive attitude about this
5120175 theres no way around it it is what it is
5120176 they were coming off of solid strong dedicated pastoral ministry
5120177 lang taught us that we are the ministers of the congregation
5120178 this was a difficult situation but some good came out of it
5120179 this congregation learned how strong it is it learned a church is more than its pastor
5120180 we found out about the sexual abuse allegations on the weekend of his installation and we took immediate action
5120181 right away they wanted to make sure there were no secrets
5120182 this obviously is one of the most egregious cases where someone was able to slip through the cracks
5120183 forgiveness is possible you can be forgiven but you cant be a pastor anymore
5120184 the church should always be a safe place especially for children
5120185 there was really no relationship built between him and us or us and him
5120186 nothing that we do as a congregation for this community had one small hiccup
5120187 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

5120192 the same old folks that brought you the same team
5120193 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry

5120200 were getting to the point i feel personally that we can win at any race track we go to
5120201 our pit crew has stepped up their game that was our weakness for a long time and the guys have repeatedly week after week worked harder and become better
5120202 every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us what we just have to keep doing is going out here and try to win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5120203 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5120204 but the important points i played very good that was the difference
5120205 im pretty sad that maybe i couldnt give 100 today
5120206 its pretty sore too tight and i feel it when i move or serve or get ready for a return
5120207 i got a little lucky he moved to the other side
5120208 after that ace i felt very relaxed it was a very good sensation
5120209 it got better in the second set but it still wasnt great
5120210 i dont play against rafael nadal or roger federer or any top top players
5120211 i dont know what will happen when i play against them but it will be a good test for me
5120212 were executing for the most part in different facets of the game were doing a lot of things well right now
5120213 getting ahead of the hitters keeping the pitch count down i wanted to finish the game for sure
5120214 the thing thats most rewarding here is what can be learned about what ive done
5120215 you dont have to put an age limit on your dreams im hoping that people out there that may have thought they were too old to do certain things can realize theyre not
5120216 shes truly remarkable she gives me hope for another 20 years
5120217 she actually was talking about childbirth in the ready room
5120218 she thought swimming is tough but she said childbirth is harder
5120219 shes done a fantastic job proving that women can have children and still compete at a high level
5120220 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5120221 being pain free in the later part of the year i started feeling confident from may on its getting better and better and now in the offseason i know what to work on for next year
5120222 nothing would make me happier or prouder than to win the cn canadian open
5120223 and priddis next year in calgary that golf course sets my eye already
5120224 today i was very very nervous because i was the favorite to win the tournament
5120225 in a final if you play your best you can win for sure but i think today i played more with my mind than my body

5120234 we got three and four wide and my car was really good rolling through the middle there and i guess tony got to the outside of the 48
5120235 it just looked like tony kind of came down and there was just no room to move because we were all so tight coming off there
5120236 were doing our thing like we do every weekend we work hard drive hard and try to do the best job we can there is no pressing anything if the car has got it ive got it if the pit crews got it then we show it and when it doesnt it doesnt i mean you just go to work when its not
5120237 vom intruni cel mai probabil marti consiliul de administratie si adunarea generala a actionarilor si vom cauta sa gasim o solutie pentru a iesi din aceasta situatie nu puteam achizitiona carbune la oferta facuta in plus mai asteptam citeva oferte din indonezia
5120238 vom informa ministerul internelor si reformei administrative ministerul economiei si finantelor presedintele romaniei primul ministru asupra situatiei critice in care ne aflam e o situatie la nivel national nu un caz particular
5120239 daca nu se pune problema de a arde pacura pentru a incalzi populatia oricum va fi gasita o solutie pentru ca iesenii sa nu sufere de frig
5120240 nu exista o strategie la nivel national iar piata libera s a transformat in monopol
5120241 saptamina trecuta a fost prima si singura data cind s au vindut sarmale si placinte era un domn acum nu mai a mai venit aici nu prea vin nici vinzatorii nici cumparatorii
5120242 daca nu platesti taxe si ai totul gratis de la primarie de ce dai piinea la acelasi pret ca in alimentara
5120243 sint putini tarani si preturile la fel ca si in celelalte piete
5120244 aici merge mult mai bine decit in tatarasi acolo este si mai departe si nici nu cred ca au mijloace de transport pina acolo aici cu vinzarea noastra sintem multumiti
5120245 sint foarte putini tarani marfa la fel de putina si preturile la fel ca si in celelalte piete doar varza ce e la 0 65 de lei ca in rest ardeii tot 3 lei si prunele tot 1 5 lei ca peste tot
5120246 in piata la alexandru pepenii sint cu 0 80 de lei kilogramul aici sint cu 1 1 lei ardeii sint mai scumpi ceapa aici e cu 1 5 lei in pietele alexadru si nicolina o iei cu 1 leu
5120247 motorina gazul ingrasamintele toate sint foarte scumpe cu preturile practicate de noi abia daca ne acoperim munca si cheltuielile nu le puteam da nici degeaba dau vinetele cu 2 lei kilogramul rosiile la fel ardeii capia intre 1 5 3 lei am avut si 45 de kilograme de pastai dar le am terminat de dimineata si le am dat la 3 lei kilogramul cistigam si noi cistiga si clientul
5120248 am venit sa vindem pentru ca este singura modalitate de a scoate bisnitarii de pe piata am avut cazuri in care au venit sa cumpere en gros si nu am vrut sa le dam mai mult de 5 6 kilograme nu vindem daca vine un client si doreste mai multe kilograme il servim pentru ca deja pe bisnitari ii recunosti de cum ii vezi
5120249 e tare buna piata asta dar nu mi place ca fac diferenta de cea din tatarasi sa aduca si aici peste si brinzeturi la ce administratie are iasul nu sint in stare sa aduca si aici niste combine frogorifice
5120250 sint bine venite si comparativ cu piata independentei ca eu de acolo mai fac cumparaturi preturile sint mai mici dar daca ar vrea sa faca o treaba buna atunci ar trebui ca acestea piete sa tina de dimineata pina seara intreaga saptamina si sa vina mai multi comercianti oamenii mai si muncesc oricum produsele se simt la gust ca sint de tara iar rosiile sint exceptionale
5120251 he was one of the initiators of the whole concept of bringing tenants together politically and organizing to have power at city hall
5120252 his activism has quite literally touched pretty much everybody who lives in the central city
5120253 but yet the only people our gun laws prevent from getting a gun are people who obey the law
5120254 medicina dentara s a dezvoltat mai ales in sistem privat din aceasta cauza majoritatea medicilor sint ocupati cu propriile cabinete si n ar fi de acord sa faca garzi mai ales voluntar oricum atit timp cit lucreaza in sistem privat nu pot fi obligati sa asigure urgentele pe timpul noptii
5120255 pacientii trebuie sa inteleaga ca noi sintem o clinica de chirurgie nu cabinet dentar putem asigura urgente in caz de traumatisme supuratii si alte probleme ce tin de specialitatea noastra totusi nu putem sa refuzam pacientul il consultam si ii facem o recomandare dar mai mult de administrarea unui calmant nu putem face
5120256 noi nu putem scoate nervul pentru ca e nevoie de ace de canal iar acestea reprezinta instrumentar stomatologic care nu intra in dotarea noastra toata lumea spune ca vine aici pentru ca noi tot cu dintii ne ocupam
5120257 contractele semnate cu cabinetele de medicina dentara prevad obligatia de a presta maxim 35 de ore pe saptamina timp de cinci zile in conditiile in care medicii primesc relativ putini bani de la cjas nu sintem in masura sa le impunem nimic
5120258 valoarea serviciilor medicale pe care le deconteaza cjas este stabilita prin lege iar pachetul de servicii este si el destul de redus din banii pe care ii primeste de la noi un medic dentist nu poate sustine si activitate pe timpul noptii el va alege oricum sa desfasoare cele sapte ore de lucru intr o perioada de timp in care stie ca exista adresabilitate
5120259 proiectul facultatii de medicina dentara nu a functionat pentru ca nu erau pacienti daca nu sint clienti inseamna ca nici bani nu sint de asta nu vor medicii
5120260 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
5120261 if you have more then eight funds you should slap yourself
5120262 how many funds should you have four to six should do
5120263 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run
5120264 it does not take much to outperform the average investor all you have to do is put half your money in the vangurd total stock market and the other half in an intermediate term bond fund
5120265 oh by the way i also receive a 100k yr pension paid medical etc

5120272 if you dont have a fidelity or whatever account we wont contribute to your account
5120273 we agree to match employees who have accounts at metlife insurance company but noone else
5120274 the government is going to learn what the music industry is learning the net is a wall buster
5120275 its not policeable there are not enough cops in the world to monitor all the communications and digital commerce thats going on the effort to control the flow of drugs into the u s is a complete failure with or without the internet the internet is just going to make it harder there are millions of new ways for consumers and retailers to find each other the dea can sniff all the packages it wants but it cant make more than a fraction of a dent in the business
5120276 i know enough people online that could get almost anything for me in minutes
5120277 thats the power of the net its really not for the government to be telling people whether they should be using marijuana or not and the internet makes it possible for people to make these judgments on their own the internet has killed off traditional notions of moral policing
5120278 theres a pile of drugs on my desk dozens of pills of different shapes sizes and colors designed to treat obesity baldness and erectile dysfunction my doctor did not prescribe them and knock on wood i have no medical need for any of them how did they get here through the magic of the world wide web
5120279 the commission identified overseas betting sites as a major problem
5120280 in cooperation with authorities in other countries we can arrest and extradite dealers
5120281 i live in the netherlands where cannabis is allowed i do nothing wrong
5120282 in holland doctors give cancer patients cannabis and it helps i can help other people who need it also most of the people who are buying from me are ill most of them have cancer themselves that is why they buy it on the internet
5120283 if somebody is 40 or 50 years old how can he buy it if the government wont allow it
5120284 if you are sick and you need it and you know that it helps why not
5120285 the whole purpose for having federal law enforcement as opposed to state county or municipal law enforcement is so that we can most efficiently and effectively utilize taxpayer resources it is not appropriate for federal level resources to be used to prosecute someone in possession of one joint
5120286 that does not mean we wont arrest you and prosecute you through the state system if youre using the mail thats a separate crime that you can be charged with
5120287 if a website is in amsterdam we dont have any jurisdiction there
5120288 if marijuana does come here and if customs doesnt catch it and we do then of course well seize it there we run into the issue of whether it will be prosecuted that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction sometimes if the u s attorneys office doesnt want to prosecute a local da will it would depend on the quantity of drugs and how often a person had been receiving them wed definitely look into it to see if this was a one shot deal or if theyd been getting packages every week
5120289 marijuana is the most prevalent drug found in the mail and postal inspectors focus investigative efforts on the large quantities associated with drug dealers
5120290 without hesitation we would prosecute them we prosecute people who possess marijuana every day
5120291 if someone has marijuana and they have a recommendation to have it under state law were not going to prosecute
5120292 we dont have any state agencies investigating what goes through the mail so if the feds have a hands off policy there probably wouldnt be a prosecution id have to see an actual case and make a determination based on the persons criminal history medical need the amount and whether they had a legitimate medical recommendation i truly believe that marijuana has some medical purpose and i truly believe that some people are abusing proposition 215 the proposition legalizing possession of medical marijuana legitimate patients should be able to use medicinal marijuana without being hassled by the police
5120293 patients are scattering its all underground theyre just getting it off the street
5120294 people will try to gain access any way they can
5120295 i think its a great idea as long as what theyre selling is what theyre advertising patients dont have too many choices these days
5120296 i talk to people about growing tell them about the right lights to use a lot of people cant grow their own so they try to find out who is selling it it breaks my heart that they have to scramble around like that
5120297 one of the problems with 215 is they say you can have marijuana for medicinal purposes but where the hell is it supposed to come from
5120298 youre either going to have to grow it or have a caregiver grow it for you right now thats all the law permits
5120299 i had a very good friend use marijuana at the end of her life and you want your marijuana to be clean you dont want people who are already sick to have stuff that might be contaminated some of the stuff that comes up from mexico is often padded with other ingredients really foul ingredients thats why i always recommend to bona fide patients that they grow it themselves
5120300 in the economics of marijuana cultivating for seeds is a better industry than cultivating for bud
5120301 those little seeds are just worth so much money it takes years to get them because you have to do all this genetic work when you buy seeds youre buying knowledge of what the plant is if they tell you for example that the plant will mature in exactly 92 days it generally will
5120302 soft with a citruslike aroma and a good high easy to grow grows with long compact resinous buds
5120303 100 sativa large long bud leaves buds are also large and long with lots of resin a sweet licorice or anise flavor up high similar to thai also does very well under artificial light
5120304 i went with one of his five star guys it took about a month but i got my product and i was very happy with it they did an excellent job
5120305 unless you knew someone went to canada or flew over to amsterdam
5120306 its the greatest source on the internet for growing advice there are four or five guys who are really cool and will answer pretty much any question
5120307 id kill a house plant marijuana literally grows like a weed you can buy a cheap fluorescent light and keep it over your seeds and in a 120 days youll have a cheap jumbo crop
5120308 i worry to some extent but really theyd have to be kind of silly to pay attention to me why would anyone spend an ungodly amount of money to catch someone buying 10 seeds i do take precautions though i use proxy servers and remailers to post to the newsgroups which makes it a real pain to trace it back to me
5120309 technically seeds are illegal but there isnt thc in the seeds only in the plant itself
5120310 they would be seized but as far as prosecution it would depend on the local climate
5120311 i would be very cautious about putting my name out there as a consumer of marijuana
5120312 we have run several messages on our website saying that one of the stupidest things you can do is buy pot through the internet its even riskier than going up to somebody in the street
5120313 who knows whos behind the website what if its a government agency and theyre keeping a list of everyone theyre sending pot to
5120314 i met a gentleman from the company who said they were doing fine its strange that theyre able to survive
5120315 i have hesitations because of the federal governments ability to tap into it they might even be dealing with a narc to catch people who are propositioning them you dont know what youre getting into
5120316 while in theory the idea of being able to click for pot is good and in practice it is happening its a very temporary thing i suspect i wouldnt do it its frightening i think that people should be clear about what theyre doing when youre breaking the law you shouldnt let yourself get caught the government can just trace where the clicks came from and round up enormous numbers of people it lends itself to a conspiracy prosecution people get away with breaking the law for a period of time but it does catch up to you
5120317 most of my clients have been ripped off many times on the internet before they came to me
5120318 this is one more step in our movement to launch a pacifist guerrilla medi pot dispensary for the chronic suffering patients of san jose but which we will operate from a virtual location
5120319 if our website seems slightly irreverent toward the so called drug war and so called drug warriors we apologize but we needed the dark humor for novel extents of parabolic range and breadth
5120320 and the internet novel approach is intended to hopefully bring a quicker end to any unnecessary suffering of patients today now before even more of them join the already deceased patients who now feel no more pain but who were forced as a result of political positioning to endure their suffering without a safe source for this simple herbal remedy if our web sites also seem slightly fanatical at times it is because the stratified contradictions in the so called drug war become hilarious when exposed and this is also to heighten the novel experience
5120321 for those who believe that we who used an illegally smoked mantra as a unifying element especially those who used it with us but then after our goals were achieved in halting the vietnam war should have stopped the smoke i argue that our next goal needed to be to expose the government complicity in causing such a benign substance to be so feared and maligned and thereby better prepare the government against such a flawed policy achilles heel from future protester strengths against the government
5120322 the internet cant gloss over the fact that its not walgreens on the other end of the line its still just a drug dealer with a home page
5120323 i can hire pr people to be models as a matter of fact i am hiring one on craigslist now to do a video pitch for my new software
5120324 need hot woman for viral web video i am looking for somebody that has a very bubbly personality and can look hot in on video you must be in a bikini and look hot
5120325 we must ban which web site is against our rules with this way we can get succed and block them

5120327 am prevazut in buget suma de 172 miliarde de lei vechi pentru filarmonica din iasi ministerul educatiei alocind deja 10 miliarde la teatrul national unde procedurile erau incurcate s a reziliat vechiul contract si foarte curind vom demara procedurile de licitatie
5120328 tinta este sa ne apropiem de pozitia a saptea ca putere economica in uniunea europeana estimam ca pib va creste de la 135 miliarde euro cit este in prezent la 220 miliarde euro de asemenea in 2012 pib pe cap de locuitor va fi 10 000 euro in echivalentul banilor de astazi salariul mediu brut lunar va fi de 3 000 lei iar pensia medie de 1 250 1 300 lei
5120329 investitiile din bugetul de stat se ridicau in anul 2007 la 15 in acest an vor creste la 18 iar in 2009 cred ca ne vom apropia de 20 estimarile noastre sint ca investitiile straine in perioada 2009 2012 vor fi de 30 40 miliarde euro investitiile din buget de 30 miliarde euro la care se adauga 25 miliarde euro din fonduri europene

5120348 the best thing thats happened to me in my life
5120349 drew 31 4 million viewers in february 1990 according to cited by the network
5120350 since the games opened on august 15 and saturday nights audience peaked at 40 million viewers in the half hour during which the mens 400 meter medley was held
5120351 oh naryu im so sorry i never knew or i wouldnt have pushed you to be with him
5120352 youre the first one besides rafe and me to know
5120353 im surprised you were able to be around him like you were with the whole getting joash and me together and the tutoring and all the other stuff
5120354 well i was opening up to him more but after he kissed me i registered what was going on and didnt want a replay of what happened in the past so i cut off all ties
5120355 after the play he told me to come over and when i entered he just kissed me
5120356 but if he broke off your friendship then why does he hate you
5120357 i got to go kill rafe now that i know what he did to you
5120358 you cant let anyone know that you know not even rafe
5120359 yeah i just wish someone else could like me to
5120360 i dont know which weve had more of good or bad
5120361 i say good because no time i spend with you is ever bad
5120362 i said i would tell you after and i will
5120363 why did you jump into the pool and take me with you at hinas last party
5120364 about an hour ago you fell asleep while the sun was rising so i carried you to the car and brought you home
5120365 your sister convinced me to stay for breakfast and your sister told me i could wait in your room
5120366 on why you brought me on a date in the first place
5120367 hina told me what you thought happened in our past and i never said those things to you so i thought i would prove to you that i still am the old rafe and that i never hurt you like you said
5120368 rafe you were standing there and you said those things that broke my heart forever it was your voice and everything
5120369 no you showed me that you can be decent not that it wasnt you
5120370 you said you would give me another chance and since those words left your mouth i havent done anything wrong
5120371 what happened to you hating me cant we go back to those times when we didnt have the nerve to talk to one another
5120372 because i let myself get to close and now i cant just pull away
5120373 naryu you have no reason why i hated you do you
5120374 those things that you thought that i said to you well you said them to me
5120375 exactly i didnt say them to you but a person who looked like me did
5120376 i dont believe you you are just trying to get close to me so you can hurt me again
5120377 naryu let me prove it to you give me a week and after that if you still dont believe me i will leave you alone forever
5120378 and if i dont let you prove it to me
5120379 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5120380 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5120381 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5120382 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5120383 it was not quite what i had expected but athens was an awesome time
5120384 our disappointment in 2004 has really given him a lot of motivation to continue
5120385 he looks fantastic and he should be a strong medal threat
5120386 i went to watch him compete at the olympic trials and it was definitely bittersweet
5120387 i got to go to the olympics i got to dive with my brother not many people get a chance to do that
5120388 the olympics is i dont want to say a once in a lifetime opportunity because people can go more than once but it was definitely a lifelong goal
5120389 it was a great run not sure i was quite ready to give it up but when my guard unit offered me the opportunity to come to pilot training i could not turn that down how many folks get to fly f 16s
5120390 i spent my entire life getting ready for seven seconds of competition that is pretty much what we do every day here flying f 16s
5120391 you never know when you will be called to go do your job
5120392 generally it is in a split second when you need to pickle off a bomb or strafe a target diving definitely lends itself to what im doing now
5120393 i kind of just of knew that is what i really wanted to do
5120394 but i got really sidetracked over the next 15 to 20 years
5120395 it was not making the team in 2000 i just missed it that made me really sit back and reevaluate what i wanted to do with my life
5120396 that itch to be a fighter pilot had never gone away so i started taking private flying lessons
5120397 it took me 20 years to make it to the olympics
5120398 it might give me a chance to dive with my brother again i would really enjoy that
5120399 the olympics was fantastic but im not disappointed that i gave up the opportunity to go again in 2008 to do this i would say that this might even be better

5120408 sellers coming to the market in the middle of the summer holiday season tend to be more motivated london in particular appears to be having its own special summer sale with over 21 000 pounds off in a month
5120409 helping to spur this jump was the launch of new products and pizza toppings the success of our double top offer where customers pay an extra 3 to double the toppings of a pizza and our bigger better pizza campaign which highlighted how competitors have shrunk their pizzas
5120410 our internet ordering facility is also gaining momentum with 90 of our stores expected to be taking online orders by january 2009
5120411 in the year ahead we will continue to improve our offering with new pizza toppings better ingredients and an expanded network of stores

5120500 look there is simply no other way to say it but to speak the absolute brutal truth here general petraeus has shockingly abrogated and noxiously defiled the sacred oath he took to protect and preserve support and defend not a parochial biblical worldview of the new testaments gospel of jesus christ but the united states constitution which includes a specific beacon provision which boldly proclaims absolutely no religious test in clause 3 article 6 by so very prominently and universally endorsing chaplain mccoys book with its unadulterated promotion of christian religious supremacy and concomitant excoriating and denigrating of the veracity integrity and character of the hundreds of thousands of united states military personnel who freely elect to follow no religious path petraeus unlawfully fashions his own de facto religion test in direct contravention of americas most cherished and beloved governing document his command leadership role thus has become terminally freighted and compromised with this disgusting vile unconstitutional christian religious tyranny and exceptionalism at precisely the same time we are at war with islamic fundamentalists framing americas iraq and afghanistan combat efforts as a modern day crusade the monumentally detrimental national security risks attendant to petraeuss actions of constitutional defiance justify the swift forfeiture of his titular position of military command and further cry out for his immediate punishment by general courts martial under article 134

5120502 being christian should bring goodness to our culture but the way it is being censored in our society you would think that to be a christian is to be a wicked torturous warmonger who wields religion over the heads and hearts of local governments to establish more wicked rules of right and wrong for everyone to obey without question where is this wickedness since when did christian become evil

5120552 las gestiones con los centros de adopciones de china se han ralentizado much simo de hecho el porcentaje con respecto al a o 2006 ha disminuido un 40 por ciento tanto en canarias como en el resto del pa s
5120553 en un principio la gente opt por adoptar ni os chinos porque la administraci n de este pa s es muy eficiente y transparente aunque tambi n algunos detectamos que en algunos casos lo hicieron por snobismo porque era la moda ahora muchos de los que adoptaron en su d a no cumplen los requisitos necesarios por mucho que quieran
5120554 se luch mucho pero tuvimos suerte sacamos en esos meses unos 120 expedientes de los cuales 50 eran de familias monoparentales
5120555 es algo fuera de lo normal que de 110 expedientes con los que estamos trabajando 30 sean de varones antes el porcentaje de ni as era de un 99 9 por ciento y ahora el de ni os ha aumentado hasta un seis por ciento
5120556 puede ser que en alg n caso una familia que hubiera pedido una ni a retirara su solicitud si se le iba a adjudicar un var n
5120557 andeni en canarias en concreto ha pasado de gestionar 250 o 300 expedientes al mes a ser 8 o 10 como mucho
5120558 las asignaciones a familias canarias que se han llevado a cabo en los ltimos dos meses corresponden a solicitudes de hace a os sus expedientes llegaron al centro de adopciones de china en el a o 2006 como m nimo
5120559 hay algunas comunidades que el porcentaje de adopciones de ni os chinos ha disminuido un 80 por ciento y en otras ni siquiera se ha tramitado un expediente en lo que va de a o
5120560 esperamos con ansias que se restablezcan las normas anteriores desde china ya hay insinuaciones de que se esto va a ser as aunque no sabemos cuando tenemos las garant as verbales de los pol ticos chinos y su palabra el ley ya han admitido que las normas nuevas no son las id neas y eso es lo m s importante

5120574 i thought what can i do to make my babies proud i think about what theyll think about the year they were born who i was and what i did
5120575 working out and getting back into shape isnt exciting to me but training for a triathlon is theres a goal at the end of it something to reach for
5120576 certainly i advise them and i have some information and ideas but i dont make decisions on my own
5120577 i think how you feel about those decisions depends on where you stand there are many people that would say our decision for the new high school site was absolutely the right decision saved this community a lot of money in terms of the purchase of the land
5120578 now how much responsibility should be given to the board of education and the superintendent to maintain green space
5120579 based upon what we knew at the time and what the expectations were from what we felt the community expected us to do i think we made the right decision now after making it some community members expressed they had different expectations and we felt it was very important to go back and try to meet even their expectations
5120580 you know i am proud of the fact that we have been able to meet the boards goals of increasing achievement for all students and closing the achievement gap among groups of students
5120581 im very proud that for the five years that ive been here weve been recognized as the district with distinction in performance a state recognition that had not happened before my coming and i certainly hope it continues to be the status for columbia public schools
5120582 im also very proud of passing the largest bond issue ever in the history of columbia a 60 million bond levy that is allowing us to build the first new comprehensive high school in 36 years and our 20th elementary school
5120583 i think we all have to ask ourselves the question where is all of this going
5120584 that process is what a board of education meeting is about anyone can ask questions at that time the open forum allows you to do that then again youd have to show your face or say your name and if you really dont have anything thats true or accountable you dont want to be a part of that process now thats my opinion
5120585 i think the challenges will be similar in terms of continuing to engage the public and dialogue around whats best for columbia public schools ensuring that the public knows they are a part of that decision making process and that their opinions are valued in this district
5120586 i think certainly looking at increased expectations as they are demonstrated through the no child left behind act as well as expectations from the state of missouri concerning achievement in an arena of diminishing resources that will certainly be a challenge for whoever is in this seat and for this entire community
5120587 certainly there are some things id like to see in the next superintendent but i dont think its appropriate for me to weigh in on that as the person sitting in this chair right now thats just my opinion
5120588 whatever the board needs from me im here for them
5120589 first of all columbia is a wonderful place to live
5120590 its a 250 000 building on a 30 000 budget that doesnt happen everyday
5120591 producing and finishing a feature length film in so short of a time period and with no immediate funding is a daunting task to say the least
5120592 everybody took a deep breath or two or three deep breaths maybe studied their shoestrings before saying yes
5120593 this is a 250 000 building on a 30 000 budget
5120594 this project is going to do more to teach people about green technology than any amount of advertising
5120595 the kids will be helping us think of how to reduce utilities usage
5120596 thats the energy i feel when i go in it its going to be a learning opportunity
5120597 its fun to watch people able to be really flexible
5120598 we are committed to getting jennifer hartz second grade teacher in here and the kids in this building one way or another
5120599 it shows we are thinking of the future and of our children

5120620 social monogamy refers to two people who live together have sex with one another and cooperate in acquiring basic resources such as food clothes and money sexual monogamy refers to two people who remain sexually exclusive with one another and have no outside sex partners genetic monogamy refers to the fact that two partners only have offspring with one another
5120621 how bad can it be look the company prides itself of being an equal opportunity employer what does that mean
5120622 it means that we were not prejudiced in our selection techniques
5120623 of course were bloody prejudiced we want someone who can do that job
5120624 yes yes but if two people came in and one of them was er

5120626 equal opportunities means that theyd both be considered regardless of who they were affirmative action is intended to address a perceived lack of some group in a company for pr purposes

5120637 saw a unique opportunity to slot in their film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
5120638 by no means are they trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008
5120639 we are making a great game that harry potter fans will really enjoy we are evaluating the impact of the movie date change

5120644 i think you should buy your shirts a bit bigger these days even though you have those pecs
5120645 it is too early to speak to the possibility of software plus services being abused or speculate on whether or not it will have a positive impact on software piracy
5120646 where will the business software alliance come into play how will end users know that what they are using is legal if a business is fully reliant upon hosted software and that company is running illegal software the bsa could essentially put that end user out of business by shutting down the illegal hosting company
5120647 i definitely think well see a lot of software piracy go away but as with any subscription based service people are probably going to be playing with licensing numbers and i think this will make user authentication models even more important
5120648 most violations that i see are due to ignorance not reading or understanding those complex license agreements or trusting an unscrupulous technician who probably offered a solution for way under the price of any competitors
5120649 ive always felt that piracy losses seemed overinflated the warez kiddies are responsible for most piracy traffic
5120650 am cautat parteneri in multe situatii si vom continua in acelasi mod pentru a obtine cea mai eficienta strategie pentru companie
5120651 utilizarea betonului determina o scadere a costurilor investitiei cu aproximativ 17 in cazul unei constructii noi si cu 40 a cheltuielilor de reparatii
5120652 un exemplu foarte bun in acest sens este autostrada fetesti cernavoda care este realizata din beton si care se comporta foarte bine in comparatie cu autostrada bucuresti pitesti care stim cum arata
5120653 autostrazile din beton reprezinta cea mai buna solutie pe termen lung atit din punct de vedere al costurilor cit si al intretinerii romania este o tara unde traficul greu este in dezvoltare si acest tip de drum este mult mai rezistent

5120658 dumnezeu stie ce o sa se intimple acum ma simt bine dar mai am de facut 12 sedinte la accelerator mi a zis medicul ca boala e pe terminate insa vom vedea ce va fi
5120659 din cazurile de pina acum 30 au fost cancere orl 28 cancer genital cancer de sin 18 tumori cerebrale 12 tumori bronhopulmonare 3 4 si digestive 7 8 tratamentul cu accelerator are doua directii curativa si paleativa din nefericire majoritatea pacientilor ajung la noi prea tirziu si efectele pozitive ale tratamentului sint de scurta durata in ciuda eforturilor noastre s au pierdut multi din cauza asta
5120660 dumnezeu ne face atit de frumosi si uite cum ajungem
5120661 eram disperata cind am ajuns aici cind am vazut cita suferinta si durere exista in acest loc si cind mi am dat seama ca si eu trebuie sa ramin pur si simplu am clacat de cind sint in spital am facut si diabet pe fond de stres dumnezeu ne face atit de frumosi si uite cum ajungem
5120662 de teama sau sub diverse influente multi pacienti prefera sa foloseasca tratamente naturiste si ajung la medic in stadii foarte avansate ale bolii din pacate asteapta de la noi minuni in momentul in care nu putem face altceva decit sa alinam intr o anumita masura suferinta
5120663 faptul ca medicii si asistentele te trateaza omeneste si vorbesc frumos ajuta mai mult decit zece medicamente sint oameni speciali cei care lucreaza aici
5120664 rezultatele nu se pot aprecia decit in doi trei ani exista boala stationara progresiva si regresiva in aceasta specialitate vezi mereu suferinta si durere micile noastre bucurii sint tumorile sterile au fost cazuri in care dupa tratamentul cu acceleratorul pacientii au fost operati si tumorile au fost gasite sterile adica topite aceste lucruri ne dau sperante
5120665 nu cred ca exista atit de multe diferente intre candidanti indiferent de ceea se va intimpla va fi o provocare enorma pentru urmatoarea administratie
5120666 posibilitatea de a stabili o cooperare activa cu tarile europene si cu alte state interesate de informatii in domeniul spatial
5120667 nimic nu e mai important ca odata cu alegerile parlamentare sa se organizeze si un referendum pentru modificarea constitutiei in ceea ce priveste imunitatea pentru demnitari
5120668 atunci nu ar mai fi fost nevoie de toata gimnastica asta verbala de promisiuni de modificare a constitutiei facute tot de psd sau de alte angajamente fara acoperire
5120669 sa vorbeasca cind voteaza pentru judecarea lui nastase si mitrea
5120670 cind vor vota pentru trimiterea in instanta a parlamentarilor psd
5120671 oamenii astia chiar nu isi dau seama cit de penibili si ridicoli sint si ne cred prosti pe toti dupa ce se pun de a curmezisul trimiterii in justitie a lui nastase si mitrea acum au devenit ingeri si sfinti ne sfideaza si ii considera idioti pe toti romanii cind vor vota pentru trimiterea in instanta a parlamentarilor psd doar atunci sa scoata capul si sa vorbeasca pentru ca au compromis efortul de ridicare a clauzei de salvgardare pe justitie pentru romania

5120677 its a huge challenge for archivists to deal with digital information
5120678 one of the most interesting problems for digital preservation is interactivity and how difficult that is to preserve
5120679 we want to raise the consciousness in the industry about how important these records are
5120680 i do not think they save anything or its saved in such a way that they would not be able to recognise the significance of what they are holding
5120681 a lot of people have mentioned the murder of lord british a
5120682 we acknowledge the nameplates strong heritage in the design but recognize that keeping this modern sports car relevant meant more than simply honoring a classic car the line forms stance and overall execution are consistent with other new chevrolets
5120683 be very very careful america the romans used to do this you and the romans only ones with your hands over your hearts
5120684 i think the owner is happy like the other fans
5120685 i have a lot to learn i need to build myself up and work on my right foot and im still a few years away yet
5120686 it is not affecting my game if anything it gives you a boost to read something about yourself in the paper its nice
5120687 i cant get ahead of myself although id like to play in the premiership some day
5120688 last week i had just returned home from shopping my house is set back
5120689 de gelovigen in hun onderlinge liefde vriendelijkheid en compassie zijn als het menselijke lichaam wanneer een lichaamsgedeelte een klacht heeft is de gehele rest er in betrokken door slapenloosheid en koorts
5120690 jullie aardse vuur is n van de 70 delen van het hellevuur
5120691 o boodschapper van allah sallallahoe aleihi wa sallam allahs zegen en vrede zij met hem dit gewone vuur is toch voldoende om de ongelovigen mee te pijnigen
5120692 het hellevuur heeft 69 delen meer dan het gewone wereldse vuur waarbij elk deel zo heet is als dit wereldse
5120693 denkt u dat wanneer ik de voorgeschreven gebeden verricht de maand ramadan vast mijzelf de halaal zaken toesta en de haraam zaken ontzeg en verder niets meer doe ik dan het paradijs binnentreed
5120694 ik heb tien kinderen maar ik heb nog nooit een van hen gekust
5120695 degene van mensen die de grootste beloning voor zijn gebed krijgt is degene die er het verst voor lopen en degene die er het verst voor moet lopen en degene die in de moskee wacht opdat hij zijn gebed gezamenlijk kan verrichten krijgt een grotere beloning dan degene die het alleen verricht en dan gaat slapen
5120696 niemand mag de hand van een dame vragen die reeds door zijn moslimbroeder gevraagd is maar men moet eerst afwachten tot degene die het verzoek gedaan heeft haar trouwt of haar vrijlaat
5120697 er zijn maar twee soorten mensen die het waard zijn om jaloers op te zijn een persoon die van allah voorzieningen geschonken krijgt en hij gebruikt ze voor een rechtvaardig doel en een persoon die van allah wijsheid krijgt waarmee hij oordeelt en anderen onderwijst
5120698 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5120699 hey guys this is matt he knows anthony he will be training with us for a week
5120700 why the do you want to do that you are way to good to just go off and travel you need to find a club you need to be playing somewhere
5120701 ya this was kind of the last option for me haha there wasnt even a spot for me
5120702 mate i spent 10 years in germany at 1860 i know you can play there 2nd bundesliga would be a great start for you then you could work your way up from there and make a great career
5120703 hey matt i got a hold of my good mate who is an agent when i am done playing i am going to help him out with his agency sent the video over and he is going to start looking around
5120704 now the most important question of all would you be missed
5120705 if you say you need a ride tons of guys will offer to drive you home
5120706 you dont hook up with someone while youre on a date with someone else
5120707 just because it is okay doesnt mean i want it to happen right in front of me
5120708 well my familys role for me is so important because there was the theyre they was the one whose very ha ha oh im so sorry ah my family my family oh my god im okay im so sorry i i told you that im so confident ah wait ha ha ha ha ha ha uhm sorry guys because this was really my first pageant ever because im only 17 years old and i did not expect that i came from i came from the one of the to f p 10 uhm so but i said that my family is the most important persons in my life thank you
5120709 maybe they saw in her inner beauty which is not gauged by mere sugarcoating of words or grammatically correct construction of sentences but more of being real and true to oneself and admitting that she has flaws and is imperfect
5120710 lets see how this goes youre taking the blame right
5120711 this is not like a dream team basketball person that has a multi million dollar contract
5120712 when she moved in with us it was obviously a difficult situation for her we were almost strangers
5120713 thats as good a role model as we can ask for dont you think
5120714 i was like wait i dont have a bedroom to go to back home
5120715 it was hard for me to swallow my pride and take out garbage at a gym when i had an economics degree and spanish minor
5120716 i had people come up to me like didnt you graduate what are you doing working at this gym i was like im trying to do this track thing if i get a 9 to 5 job i wont have flexibility to leave the country and go to these competitions
5120717 i went from eating ramen noodles to steak fish and chicken
5120718 were full of confidence of course britain are the favourites but the way we rode today was just a perfect ride
5120719 we wanted a really strong start so we could catch them later then it makes it much easier when you can see them on the straight it gives you a big boost at the end
5120720 we sat down two years ago and spoke about riding a four minutes 55 3
5120721 you always have to look aiming to improve times in sport the boys are confident theyve got more to come
5120722 im ashamed im starting to wonder if it was worth the price of the plane ticket to send me here
5120723 finally theres something positive to say i am super happy i have survived the day
5120724 tomorrow i can race freely and against bourgain i just have to go for it make sure i am tactically sharp and then well see
5120725 im very motivated because i want to meet bourgain in the final
5120726 i am not sure if i want to continue or if i want to do something else
5120727 the final round of the individual pursuit was really controlled basicaly i was just trying not to go in too deep
5120728 to do it all over again and then go again two hours later was really tough though and its been a long year building up for the olympics
5120729 the next challenge for me will be the team pursuit but ive done that before and ive been there before on top of that weve trained really hard for this
5120730 the danes will give us a good run for our money in the team pursuit and i might struggle a bit in tomorrow morning in the qualifying round but by the evening im sure ill be back on top of it
5120731 ive got really strong team mates around me this isnt a one man band after all
5120732 with a whinny and neigh the time has come to say goodbye
5120733 of course i shall miss you and the things we used to do
5120734 but dont forget me ill be as happy as can be in your mind for evermore
5120735 so with a whinny and neigh the time has come to say goodbye
5120736 i want it to get so crazy here that dimebag will be able to feel it
5120737 its never that thought out maybe more just because ive never gone for a character specifically
5120738 ive always gone towards a story and those stories have interested me
5120739 this is two fold because its a genre that i really dont think ive done even though people have compared the lost boys to a horror film or flatliners to a horror film which they werent in my book they were thrillers
5120740 the lost boys was a smidgen of a lot of stuff from comedy to pop culture and on purpose thats exactly what joel schumacher wanted to do with it with scary moments in it and the vanishing was a thriller to me it was not a horror film this was really specifically going after a certain audience
5120741 and then you start to try to walk out and theres 300 people behind you and your kids looking at you so youre stuck and the slow ride up is just torture and then its done you walk out going wasnt that great and then four years later you forget the front part and you do it again
5120742 i wanted to work with alex aja because i really loved the hills have eyes i thought it harkened back to these horror films that i liked which were the original amityville my fathers remake of invasion of the body snatchers the changeling the exorcist the shining and all of those films were character based i felt that this one was character based it was a drama for all intents and purposes up until one quarter of the way through the film where youre seeing a guy whos living on his sisters couch hes at an all time low with regards to his own confidence at any moment in the movie instead of going to get the job at the security place he could have gone to fight the investigation of him as a police officer it could have gone that way it was a straight up drama and i felt that that gives you an opportunity to really become invested in this guys situation this family that hes estranged from what he wants to do with his life and where hes at hes at the bottom and you want him to go up and then all of a sudden this horrific circumstance arises and it moves into this genre i was really attracted to that story and that idea as much as i was anything
5120743 given the history and the track record maybe those are the kinds of stories that when i go to see something i really respond to i really responded to the gene hackman character in the french connection thats a really tortured guy he had this great scene where he wakes up and hes handcuffed to his own bed by the ankle and the girl is running naked through his apartment thats not a healthy guy
5120744 there are so many films nick nolte in 48 hours was that guy i have always been drawn to those characters as a viewer and as a fan i guess ive been attracted certainly on some level to those characters i feel like i understand them on some level and i think those films are interesting and certainly with something like jack bauer they were interesting to someone else too
5120745 for instance in the changing room sequence i never saw a lady screaming and i never saw anyone on fire he would just say specifically this is where i want you to look for this because this is going to happen and this is going to happen he would just be really clear about what he wants to do alex proyas when we did dark city had to do a lot of that as well there is a relief in someone who is so clear about absolutely everything that theyre going to do whereas i have worked with people too where cgi is not something theyre familiar with theyre good at storytelling with a great style of camera but they say its going to kind of be like this and the second i hear kind of im like okay well do you kind of want me to do this or do you kind of want me to do that so theres a huge relief with someone like alex
5120746 and its all in his head too there were storyboards but i dont think i ever saw him pick them up he knows clearly in every crevice whats going to happen so when i saw the film when it was finished he was dead right everything was exactly what he had said it was going to be and even in that context i still really enjoyed the film even more than i thought i would which is a good thing because im naturally pessimistic out of 60 films i would say i was really excited about 15 of them and not one of them started out without the best intentions not one film have i ever walked onto the set the first day and thought this is going to be a piece of crap you always have this hope and this faith that this one unit whatever group comes together is going to make this thing and its going to work the reality is that its just not like that life is not like that
5120747 each one has its own telling points there was one moment and it was a first time director i wont name him because he was a nice enough guy but the camera operator and the cinematographer had gotten in an argument about crossing the line which is camera technical terminology when youre in a scene there is a line thats created between you and the other person and you cant cross and the camera cant cross once youve established that line and sometimes given some movement it can get complicated so they were having this argument and i looked off and in the corner was the director sitting down trying to figure it out and then he just went oh forget it and threw up his arms laughing so at that moment i knew i was in deep trouble
5120748 in every film there are certain scenes that you just know you have to hit its not rocket science your guy has to cry here and then he has to do this and he has to do this and he has to do this otherwise the arc isnt going to matter and whos going to give a s t and you can just tell when youre doing those scenes that its not working right and everything that built up to this moment didnt work even though you thought it did but really usually its after its usually when you go to see it and loop it that you realize oh i thought that had more energy or i thought that was better played theres a huge mysterious quotient to making a film theres so many other different elements conspiring together to make something great or not that its really not until you see the movie i saw stand by me for the first time and thought my career was over first time out of the gate so im not the greatest judge except that i knew i felt great when i was making it im not a great judge when i see stuff that im in
5120749 that was alexs ending he shot the alternate endings to pacify the powers that be who thought maybe there was a safer way to go
5120750 we did the same thing on 24 the first year i was sitting there with stephen hopkins and leslie hope and i was vehemently opposed to her dying i didnt think you could take an audience through 24 episodes when the whole point was saving his family and then lose them theyre going to go forget it im done im over this i was wrong
5120751 those were really the only two experiences that ive had with alternate endings and they both went the same the one film that surprised me was
5120752 i was 22 and joel pulled me outside and said kiefer if you dont think that there isnt a night that i go to sleep where i know your future is in my hands youre crazy
5120753 i think if brett favre has taught us anything its to never even enter into that
5120754 i love making the show season 8 would have to be extraordinary and we would have to hit a whole different way of telling the story for us to go further but anything is possible the african prequel did a lot it reinforced everything for us that we were doing in season 7 to that point which was episode 15 there was a small handful of us only 16 of us that went to africa to do that and there was something liberating about it we were away from this machine that we were responsible for creating for the last eight years all of a sudden we were free and we all got energized by that
5120755 we worked 15 16 hours a day six days a week for the three weeks we were there
5120756 i have brought you t master it took quite a lot of searching on your galaxys non holographic communications network but no man is beyond the reach of a sith
5120757 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5120758 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov
5120759 if i had been laughing when i was on the bench people would say i was an idiot
5120760 steven davis is also set to become a rangers player tomorrow
5120761 a fee has been agreed with fulham for the midfielder who was on loan at ibrox last season and a deal has been agreed with the player in principle
5120762 i could say that i practised it every day for half an hour but just an idiot would shoot from there
5120763 it was a great ball from kevin nolan and my first touch wasnt good
5120764 this camp is good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5120765 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing of the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner
5120766 i could not dream of a better start to score in my first game after four minutes now i will have to continue week in and week out and hopefully i can keep playing like that it will be brilliant
5120767 there were not that many problems for me to adapt to playing in england
5120768 when i first met the boss he said that maybe i would need a bit of time maybe up to six months but actually i felt really good straight away
5120769 i have a personal programme with the physio to get stronger because everyone has told me english football is different with more contact
5120770 it is just to be stronger and to be able to cope with the 50 50s with the intensity of english football
5120771 for what profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul

5120846 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5120847 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had

5121014 1701 also calls for the implementation of security council resolution 1559 especially the disarmament of the militias and calls for sealing the border between lebanon and syria and forbidding the entering of arms and weapons via the border especially to hizbullah
5121015 so hizbullah is violating 1701 big time and not only by hiding its weapons in warehouses in the south also we havent seen any weapons coming out of the south after the war of 2006 so did hizbullah throw its weapons used in the 2006 war into the sea
5121016 1701 says clearly no arms south of the litani river no militias south of the litani that is why unifil is here
5121017 is the unifil mandate to coordinate with hizbullah or to kick hizbullah out south of the litani
5121018 i know they are careful not to challenge unifil and there is practically no visible hizbullah fighter to be seen as far as unifil is concerned this is compliance
5121019 in lebanon everyone has a gun what graziano might have been saying is that nobody carries a gun except the army unifil and hunters in this he would be correct
5121020 until perhaps they find the other side there might be ocean water where they can wash all clean
5121021 well then perhaps again theyll return and save a long lost dream
5121022 im pleased that my work did so well but i am more pleased for the great subjects that now get honored because of the results of the exhibition
5121023 i am blessed with great customers and im so happy to share these great images with the public the subjects of my images are the true stars
5121024 many possibilities are open to you work a little harder
5121025 it is a great property but it simply didnt fit into our plans for 2009
5121026 drew 31 4 million viewers in february 1990 according to cited by the network
5121027 since the games opened on august 15 and saturday nights audience peaked at 40 million viewers in the half hour during which the mens 400 meter medley was held
5121028 they went to that apartment to rob them of money and drugs that they knew they would have
5121029 an incident like this can cause tremendous emotional strain for this child its going to take quite some time for this child to be able to get past this im sure
5121030 no one deserves to be murdered but an element of this case is the involvement of drugs on both sides of it victims and suspects therefore a lifestyle thats chosen can bring it can put you in danger and i think this is a prime example of that
5121031 after all my years of reading different books trying all kinds of stuff and listening to many different ideas my best method is the simplest eat real food eat less and live longer
5121032 this decision clears the path toward our pursuit of an effective and fair public defense system that protects new yorkers constitutional rights
5121033 the states broken public defense system can and must be fixed unfortunately the legislature has failed to address this crisis forcing us to take action in the courts
5121034 the public defense crisis in new york is unfair both to defendants and to the lawyers who are charged with representing them
5121035 defendants are denied justice because they cannot afford to pay private lawyers and public defense attorneys are not given the resources tools and training they need to do right by their clients
5121036 i like my style if people dont like my hair then they dont have to book me its quite awkward that so many people around here have copied my look
5121037 m nga r de som tror att sjuksk terskeyrket r glamour st
5121038 fashion is by its nature a thing so ugly that we have to change it every six months
5121039 and i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the son may bring glory to the father you may ask me for anything in my name and i will do it
5121040 ill see you later im going to tracy to buy myself a harley because i want to
5121041 the priority now is to ensure that the commitments made in the agreement are speedily and fully implemented
5121042 russian aggression against georgia and threats to other neighboring countries such as yesterdays to poland are unacceptable and run contrary to the principles of national sovereignty and respect for the territorial integrity of independent countries
5121043 a complete and immediate withdrawal of russian troops to the line they occupied before military action started
5121044 discussions with partners will continue about the right next steps
5121045 theyre showing their age but they still run and thats something we can start with
5121046 that such and such may be fast but nothing holds a candle to that bad ass suzuki
5121047 you know me youve always known me you just had to remember
5121048 he may be the most dangerous guy in this tournament in transition
5121049 is that like a trick question or a prediction or something
5121050 i hope at the end of the season that i feel like i made the right decision i hope jets fans and people throughout the nfl feel i made the right decision id love to win the super bowl but im not going to make any guarantees all i can say is ill do my best and hopefully thats enough
5121051 id be foolish to think that on opening day i would know this offense like ive known the offense that ive been in the past the bottom line is its still football
5121052 im not talking about the physical side because brett can still throw the football with anyone out there im talking about the mental aspect learning the offense its not that easy
5121053 im very open to new ideas new thinking free spirits that type of thing
5121054 there are some things that as a coach you dont want to coach him out of a good play you dont want to out coach a guys instincts when its working you dont want to mess that up
5121055 you can have the best players possible but it doesnt guarantee you wins i want these guys to know what im about how i play what type of leadership i have im not going to call team meetings im not going to rah rah im going to do what i have to do pat guys on the back hug them pick them up off the ground and hope they do the same for me and hope thats enough to win
5121056 when you meet him you can tell hes a superstar but he doesnt tell you that hes got the aura and charisma but hes down to earth
5121057 but they were in green bay as well there werent nearly as many people but those people in wisconsin theyd come to expect winning
5121058 bottom line is playing thats the way ive handled it my whole career
5121059 aggressively embarking on plans to develop key sectors such as info comm technology logistics infrastructure and tourism
5121060 people are going to be leaving and the dumb angels are going there
5121061 in doubt and then well make a call on wednesday based on tuesday
5121062 two out of three is the most likely case but with the unpredictability of the storm its pretty much a wait and see game
5121063 it all depends on the storm and the timing of landfall and where it hits
5121064 but it all depends on the path of the storm
5121065 well have to wait and see what city officials say what state officials say and whether they evacuate
5121066 im sure within the next 48 hours well have a better feel for how things are going to go
5121067 we have to confer with the city of st petersburg and understand its needs
5121068 tropicana field is one of the command centers for the city so thatll affect the timing of the games
5121069 but at this point its all speculative because the storm is still a good ways away from the coast

5121150 ik ben verbaasd over de mensen die zorg dragen voor zichzelf door voedsel te eten uit angst om dood te gaan maar zichzelf niet beschermen tegen zondes uit angst voor het vuur
5121151 het teken van berouw is het huilen over wat vooraf is gegaan angst om in zonden te vervallen het verlaten van het slechte gezelschap en het vergezellen van de goede mensen
5121152 waarlijk de rechten van allah zijn veel groter dan dat de dienaar ooit kan vervullen en waarlijk de zegeningen van allah zijn veel meer dan dat geteld kan worden maar wees echter berouwvol in de ochtend en de avond
5121153 te huilen uit angst voor allah is mij geliefder dan mijn gewicht in goud te schenken in liefdadigheid

5121356 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5121357 non ho visto niente di tutto ci che avevo chiesto alla squadra
5121358 a mio giudizio a livello di squadra abbiamo disputato un buon primo tempo siamo mancati un po nella velocit di manovra per tutto sommato la prestazione del frosinone stata buona nella ripresa poi il primo gol del crotone ci ha disuniti e da quel momento non siamo riusciti pi a renderci pericolosi e la seconda rete ci ha tagliato definitivamente le gambe sotto il punto di vista del gioco non siamo stati negativi la condizione fisica non pu essere ancora al top perch naturale che sia cos mancano ancora quindici giorni allinizio del campionato e anche se alla coppa ci tenevamo il nostro obiettivo resta quello
5121359 questa sera ci andata bene sotto ogni punto di vista siamo stati bravi nel giocare col baricentro basso per senza mai chiuderci nella nostra area di rigore siamo stati in grado di ribattere colpo su colpo agli attacchi del frosinone lo spirito visto quello giusto con questo atteggiamento dovremo affrontare il campionato una delle nostre caratteristiche migliori quella di giocare fuori casa allo stesso modo in cui giochiamo in casa sempre a viso aperto

5121662 and put your trust in the all mighty the most merciful who sees you when you stand up for prayer and your movements along with those who fall prostrate
5121663 the closest a person is to his lord is when he is in prostration

5121666 whosoever believes in allaah and the last day then let him speak only good or remain silent
5121667 indeed we created man and we know what his own self whispers to him
5121668 that you worship allaah as if you see him and if you do not see him then indeed he sees you
5121669 and if you do not see him then indeed he sees you

5121677 these perforated rolls are parts of a machine which when duly applied and properly operated in connection with the mechanism to which they are adapted produce musical tones in harmonious combination but we cannot think that they are copies within the meaning of the copyright act

5121687 in its original sense copyright was a publishing right only somebody who had rights over the work as a whole the copy as a noun was able to publish and distribute the work individual use was not even addressed if a person wanted to copy the verb an entire book he or she was free to do so individual reproduction was not an economic threat to content publishing because it didnt scale
5121688 the real reason the system is starting to break down now though is that information monopolies simply go against the grain of the internet there are no longer high up front costs to publishing a work of any length a system designed around the high investment model of information distribution is bound to start looking awkward now
5121689 only recently have people started feeling a contrary pull toward less restriction on copyrighted material

5121844 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5121845 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5121846 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5121847 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5121848 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5121849 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5121850 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5121851 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5121852 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5121853 we were a nine out of a 10 it seems like and those other guys were a 10 out of a 10
5121854 just to gamble a little bit on staying on track we knew at worst that we would still finish in the top five it was something to take a shot we certainly learned from it if we had to do it all over again wed probably still do it again

5121865 our asian businesses particularly thailand where economic conditions continue to improve are producing consistent results
5121866 our north american coated and building products businesses are performing at the solid levels at which they finished fiscal 2008 despite the uncertainty that currently exists within the us economy
5121867 excited by the opportunities offered in the north american market following bluescopes acquisition of fellow steelmaker imsa steel for us730 million 843 million in february
5121868 we will provide further guidance on first half fiscal 2009 performance during the november annual general meeting mr omalley said
5121869 detailed project planning for the approximate 105 day reline period is in place mr omalley said
5121870 on a longer term basis these projects will deliver both cost and volume benefits

5121879 we call on at least 12 senators to promptly declare their refusal to vote for any resolution that can lead to a constituent assembly to amend the constitution while president gloria macapagal arroyo is in power
5121880 this action will stop the cha cha train on its tracks and enable the people and our government to focus on solving the real problems of the economy and society
5121881 we are against cha cha before 2010 and if government recklessly pushes for it this may very well be the spark that will lead to a peoples uprising against this government
5121882 many of those who signed resolution no 10 signed not because of positive support to the proposed amendments to the charter but was an expression of desire to put the issue to extensive public consultation and debate so that the public may be informed on the nature of this constitutional move to amend the charter
5121883 meaning any change to the constitution will be done after 2010
5121884 she is using the presidency only to ensure her political survival and perpetuate her stay in power beyond 2010 the senate should not allow the president to keep the nation captive to her self serving agenda
5121885 we turn to the senate of the republic as our only real hope today for more responsible national political leadership we therefore urge the senate to perform its role in democratic checks and balance by passing a resolution that effectively stops this attempt to change our constitution during gmas time
5121886 many communities from pangasinan to samar to panay are still struggling to recover from the terrible damage of recent typhoons and floods
5121887 these are the terrible burdens of ordinary filipinos that president gloria macapagal arroyo has ignored while she junketed in america and china
5121888 instead of leading our government to help lighten our peoples suffering the president adds further to our problems by first unveiling an agreement with the milf that disturbs many communities that have not been consulted and may increase the risks of war breaking out once more in mindanao and second provoking political unrest and instability by declaring

5121921 the concept of substitution may be said to lie at the heart of both sin and salvation for the essence of sin is man substituting himself for god while the essence of salvation is god substituting himself for man man asserts himself against god and puts himself where only god deserves to be god sacrifices himself for man and puts himself where only man deserves to be man claims prerogatives with belong to god alone god accepts penalties which belong to man alone
5121922 let your conversation be gracious and attractive so that you have the right response for everyone
5121923 can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction
5121924 since we are no longer two but one let no one split apart what god has joined together
5121925 this patient isnt initiating much and not very alert lets give ritalin a try
5121926 we dont want to condone people taking our intellectual property and using it without our permission
5121927 but we also dont like the idea of keeping fans of our products from being able to engage with our content for the most part people who are uploading videos are fans of our movies theyre not trying to be evil pirates and theyre not trying to get revenue from it
5121928 a youtube partner made a copyright claim on one of your videos
5121929 this is really the key stat that helped make the decision very easy for us
5121930 does not see shrink wrapped software going away anytime soon
5121931 if you go to the retail stores you probably see that the amount of shelf space that they give to packaged software has declined but its still one of our best channels the place that we get most of our new customers and were still excited about it
5121932 in the online world you can literally change some of that stuff real time
5121933 when someone goes into a retail store looking for personal financial software theyre going to see quicken
5121934 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5121935 what is important is to look at that issue that has caused the mediation process appears as if it has slowed it has to do with the major issue that has to do with the distribution of power between the expected role of morgan tsvangirai as prime minister and that of mugabe as the president for the mdc i think what they would not want to do is get into any government where they dont have any meaningful power and more importantly what the mdc would not want to do is to renege on the core issue that theyve been fighting for that is a new constitution and also ensure that whatever drives the process is based on the victory that they mdc got in march
5121936 on the part of the zanu pf i think they are also negotiating from a position where they would not cede too much power and secondly they would also want to buy time in terms of ensuring that they can work on the ground in terms of getting enough support i dont think zanu pf would want to go for an election very soon they want to give themselves time and allow the economy to recover
5121937 as far as we have seen i think there is some evidence of commitment they might be going into it for different reasons the mdc might be going into the talks for the reasons that they have a mandate and there are people who are supporting them in terms of finding a solution and for zanu pf they might be going in because they are legitimacy is under threat or their legitimacy might be quite problematic
5121938 the implications of the failure of these talks are that one it shows sadc these issues should have been resolved a long time ago and where they are now is that they have reached a crisis point and they see the zimbabwe problem is likely to threaten sadc as a regional body based on the criticism from zambia and the boycott of the meeting by botswana i think that in itself is a signal that the future of the body is really threatened and for them sadc they would want to maintain that unity and if that is to be resolved they need to find a solution to the zimbabwe problem as soon as possible
5121939 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares we get pretty busy at the track sometimes
5121940 saturday night was really cool because it was a relay but his individual events were by far the best
5121941 its pretty hardcore i mean spitz was fantastic back in the day and it was cool to see that theres still a lot of room for improvement
5121942 i wasnt quite sure they were going to win it but they pulled it out and he got the medal
5121943 he just kind of seems like an average guy and that many medals is really amazing
5121944 even me when im swimming ill be thinking about that
5121945 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me
5121946 pardon him theodotus he is a barbarian and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature
5121947 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
5121948 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
5121949 summertime and christmastime is all really slow like dead slow like ghost town whatever

5121956 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia

5121993 he had a serious knee injury and it becomes a confidence thing whether youre ever going to be able to use that leg right and get your legs underneath you to hit
5121994 its been a long process but he can hit the young man can hit hes having a good year for us and we need it and when he starts using the whole field like he did today hes just going to get better
5121995 hes getting there when you blow your knee out as bad as he did it takes a while i think confidencewise hes starting to feel like he can really be a power guy and all those things we know he can hit so we just keep letting him out there
5121996 i think the one thing is that he gets a little pull conscious every once in a while and today he used the whole field thats the type of hitter he really can be the whole field
5121997 its still broken its only nine days out from breaking it so theres not that much that we can expect from it right now theyll probably re x ray here in about a week or so and see if its been healed and healing and go from there
5121998 no ill probably stay here and at some point ill be able to start rehabbing
5121999 they just kind of asked about what we saw different in him
5122000 like i said he was getting down a little lower with his arm getting on the side of stuff and it wasnt sinking at all
5122001 ben came to us he had been hurt his senior year at the u and he was a talented guy and he fit right into what we wanted to do throwing our ball to our tight ends
5122002 he had a great couple of years for us actually started the super bowl and was a big part of our success he became a free agent last year and cincinnati gave him a nice nice deal which is going to have him set for life financially so we were happy for him and happy to see that but sad to see him leave us
5122003 i was pretty impressed watching the team practice i could really see myself playing with them the team was filled with so much energy even though i was excited to watch them practice i still have to think about where would be the best football program for me and my skills dont get me wrong minnesota will always be an option for me
5122004 logic will get you from a to b but imagination will take you everywhere
5122005 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass

5122008 investors are gradually recovering confidence in the dollar and the main driver is a drop in oil and other commodities prices on growing concerns about demand not only from the industrialized nations but also from emerging countries

5122010 blogging program have found that blogging creates deeper connections with fans worldwide
5122011 it s because people get to know us better find out so much more information about us giving us more exposure readers feel like they have a connection to us personally
5122012 those are the blog entries that get the most readers
5122013 it isn t really a program about making millions of impressions in the traditional marketing sense

5122019 eva has the curves she walks in and shes happy she has fun if you dont have fun on the red carpet its game over
5122020 she got caught up in the ropes which lifted her off the ground and deposited her back on the ground very quickly
5122021 they the us have been issuing statements saying they want fiji to return to democratic rule the us has also increased investment in its military base in guam
5122022 globally the big concern is that the region is not on track to meet its development goals and thats despite economic growth and lots of aid from australia new zealand and the us
5122023 these countries are the highest per capita receivers of aid anywhere in the world but there are still law and order and corruption problems in papua new guinea and the solomon islands the economy is still too reliant on australia and aid it is the fragility of some of these nations that is in question some of them could revert
5122024 we have great potential here for tourism and the forum must also focus on sustainable economies
5122025 on the internet there are several articles in bahasa indonesia written by fellow bloggers describing the route to moko daweung in quite detail
5122026 it was not handled right by our officer but whether there was a violation of our policy that is subject to punishment i dont know
5122027 instead of helping us he asked michael what he was on

5122032 my husband has been coming out here since he was a kid but because today is such a huge deal i decided to come along as well for the whole day
5122033 i like walking around and seeing all the funny cars
5122034 oh theyve been talking about shutting us down since 1961
5122035 actually this speedway has been here since about 1945 back when it was called longview speedway before our family took it over
5122036 sure they may very well shut us down but i dont really see that happening until 10 or 15 years from now
5122037 motor vehicle crashes continue to be a leading cause of death across all ages and a major public health issue in our nation and across our region many of these deaths and injuries are completely preventable through proper use of seat belts helmets and child safety seats
5122038 to their credit state officials in virginia recognized this deadly trend as it was developing last year and launched a campaign to reverse it
5122039 id be surprised if it is as simple as a firmware upgrade of the chip so it is more likely that existing devices will have this defect forever
5122040 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
5122041 since the car is powered by electrical motors found in each of the four wheels
5122042 there is no transmission and you break intuitively by pushing the steering wheel away from your body
5122043 i believe that this design paradox of low weight and large presence could be the way well define premium in the future
5122044 quiero decirles que la polic a nacional resguarda en santa cruz las instituciones p blicas porque son patrimonio de todos los ciudadanos no pueden ser asaltados impunemente por grupos violentos financiados por el comit c vico y la prefectura
5122045 el intento de tomar a la fuerza el comando departamental de la polic a y someter con violencia f sica y psicol gica al comandante de la polic a para que entregue el mando ese intento ha fracasado porque no tiene respaldo legal ni institucional
5122046 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

5122048 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5122049 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5122050 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5122051 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5122052 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5122053 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5122054 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5122055 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5122056 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5122057 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5122058 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5122059 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5122060 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5122061 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5122062 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

5122068 hes so small you know you had to kind of do it on purpose
5122069 we think maybe we took a bad picture but we never wanted to offend anybody

5122097 we were on time for that until the last three laps and we just died off a little bit
5122098 theres still a chance that we can be one of the few new zealanders to have an olympic medal so thats our focus now
5122099 i never thought there would be a day when id ride three 57 and be disappointed
5122100 weve got to be happy and focus on the next ride
5122101 looking back on the whole campaign i think i have to be pretty happy with how things have gone
5122102 i got three rides and a ride in the finals so overall i have to be pretty happy
5122103 everyone says you learn a huge deal from your first olympic games so the second one is where its at
5122104 i dont believe 51 can be held at all i think you get into a campaign environment things close up
5122105 i think we have to look at trends and the trend is for labour to come back up im quite encouraged by the one last night because it puts us within around a point and a half of our 1999 election result and that shows a party very strongly keeping its base
5122106 so i think its game on im looking forward to the time when we down tools in parliament and get into full blooded campaign
5122107 the small parties get more publicity during a campaign as well
5122108 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps

5122112 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5122113 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5122114 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5122115 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5122116 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5122117 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5122118 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5122119 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5122120 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5122121 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5122122 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5122123 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5122124 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5122125 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5122126 like web oriented news consumers integrators are affluent and highly educated however they are older on average than those who consider the internet their main source of news
5122127 i have signed three decrees including one on the resignation of the government another on proclamation of a state of emergency in south ossetia and the third on setting up an emergency committee to settle the consequences of the georgian aggression kokoity told the channel
5122128 must work for his people and not to make profit for himself
5122129 hes a good person but hes a little bit given to the kind of bellicose rhetoric which has a tendency to inflame conflicts rather than diffuse them
5122130 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice
5122131 i am well aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5122132 lo que nos hace personas normales es saber que no somos normales
5122133 al caer la noche la residencia estaba tan silenciosa que hac a pensar en unas ruinas
5122134 ive been doing this for a while and i didnt think id be super surprised at what was going to happen here
5122135 what he has done here will enable us to get our message out with a much bigger reach
5122136 michael phelps would be worth 40 or 50 million to nike
5122137 he could literally allow them to launch a massive swimwear company and i think you are going to see an incredible bidding war for him he literally saved this olympics before the games started all the talk was about politics and censorship and as soon as he won that first gold medal it became about him
5122138 that connection will be tightened which we think will serve shareholders well
5122139 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5122140 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5122141 its an aggressive number put out there by an aggressive agent
5122142 but also eight gold medals was an aggressive number not a good idea to bet against the man right now
5122143 were trying to get this stuff out the door as fast as we can
5122144 theyre going to have to figure out a way pretty quickly to make him relevant on land
5122145 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5122146 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5122147 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5122148 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5122149 the safir ambassador rocket was successfully launched all its systems are iranian made
5122150 we have paved the way for placing a satellite in space in future
5122151 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5122152 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile program are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5122153 we do not wish to attack another country but we will defend ourselves should we be attacked
5122154 this satellite the rocket and the launch station are entirely iranian built achieved by particularly talented scientists and technicians
5122155 they didnt see the opportunities first and now theyre having to catch up
5122156 traditionally local agencies are where you serve your journalistic apprenticeship so youre good at running around after stories but not necessarily good at sitting on the phone for hours getting lots of emotional detail from a real life story
5122157 everyone from take a break up wants human interest stories
5122158 the volume of traffic at my site has increased massively in the last year
5122159 with a google search its quite easy to find an agency and real life magazines and tv programmes all help to raise awareness about selling your story
5122160 and you do need your wits about you when youre phoning the features desk of the sun or the news of the world you can hear how busy they are you have to be concise and to the point about the story which is hard if youre living it
5122161 mostly the journalist who receives it will think this is a piece of crap and rewrite it because the majority of agency writers seem to have gone to the mills and boon school of flowery writing
5122162 and we nearly always have to ring up the person in the story for more quotes
5122163 when agencies read back i think its a bit pointless
5122164 when agencies get involved it becomes a bidding war and the prices are pushed up artificially
5122165 they will claim theyve had other bids in when they havent
5122166 i say that the world wide web is the wild wild west
5122167 and make sure you can see examples of what theyve done before because there isnt any regulation and youre relying on people being honest
5122168 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5122169 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5122170 what should be a privilege for a national broadcaster has been turned into an extortion racket holding the olympics hostage with all of us paying the ransom
5122171 this could have been a golden moment for online video too bad nbc just couldnt stick the landing
5122172 id carely prepared for a difficult duel with stoner which the first laps of the race confirmed
5122173 but i have to say as well that my motorcycle was running perfectly and allowed me to ride very calmly towards victory
5122174 how can we ever respect a president that gets pimped by a 300 pound mega preacher
5122175 we didnt get a lot done and rex was a part of that
5122176 thats how it goes sometimes sometimes when everyone else struggles you want someone else to step up and make a play
5122177 well still let it play out but things are becoming clearer and clearer
5122178 he showed up over and over he knows what hes doing and hes making the most of his opportunities around the ball
5122179 the coaches coach us and our responsibility is to do what were coached to do and make plays every day thats the mindset i go out with what happens after that i kind of leave in their hands
5122180 we had people for miles coming to play in the snow
5122181 we even had people in deck chairs having a picnic in the snow outside the store
5122182 obviously were looking forward to hearing from them about the proposal and what the ecological effects are
5122183 it sounds like all the residents and campers have been accounted for
5122184 we havent delivered at this level of consistency across some of the sports which i would call the formula one sports for many many generations
5122185 the whole country has been watching and has been thrilled by team gb we are immensely proud of what they have achieved so far and inspired by their performance our olympians talent and dedication represent the very best of britain
5122186 it was never apparent to us that there was a problem with school supplies we didnt have kids and we didnt see outside that box of touring around the country
5122187 they represent us well and they always find time to raise money for public education and school children
5122188 at the beginning of the week we had a 73 2 million cut two days later a 14 million cut
5122189 we need to give schools and districts more flexibility with the dollars they have and hold them accountable for the outcome
5122190 have substantial russian populations which could be used by russia in an attempt to subvert their independence
5122191 passengers are reminded to always use the handrail and take care on the stairs
5122192 while we expect bhp will deliver a healthy set of results next year is also likely to be strong
5122193 all eyes will be on bhp billiton as traders attempt to weigh up whether they will be successful in their proposed takeover of rival miners rio tinto
5122194 we suspect that despite an apparent dovish tone to the press conference the sharp increase in julys cpi will have worried members enough to see besleys hawkish stance joined probably by tucker or sentance seeing a 2 6 1 split
5122195 the interim results will make grim reading as was flagged by the end july profit warning
5122196 his logic is that since mugabe is saying the deal currently on the table gives the prime minister a lot of powers then he must assume that position and tsvangirai becomes president
5122197 theres a strong balance between business confidence and the actual performance of the economy and with so many firms remaining downbeat we can expect uk economic growth to remain weak well into next year
5122198 it was just crazy i hope this medal is a stepping stone for british gymnastics and it will inspire youngsters to come into our sport
5122199 you need to be a certain shape and he has very long arms with a slender body a good aesthetic line
5122200 he really is an amazing competitor beijing was not really on our target sheet the plans were for 2012 because he will be at the age when you expect him to peak so this has come as a real bonus
5122201 hes a good all round gymnast especially on the pommel horse
5122202 i remember the meeting i had with his mum when he first joined he had just got a scholarship to a choral school he has a very good voice and she was in a dilemma i am glad he chose gymnastics
5122203 it would be amazing to be racing in home waters in 2012
5122204 we cant describe what we have been through these last four years and two for pippa
5122205 winning a second olympic gold medal is absolutely awesome and were all overwhelmed to be honest
5122206 and it looks like youve just missed a parking competition for blind people romans park their cars the way i would park if i had just spilled a beaker of hydrochloric acid on my lap
5122207 the only call i remember making was at about 400 metres to go i shouted gold
5122208 everything was burning and i was in a dark place but i came out the other side of it smiling
5122209 im really proud of what ive done im just disappointed with the medal we got thats all
5122210 weve just won an olympic silver medal and i just rowed in the most enjoyable crew i ever rowed in the best nine guys and the best two coaches i couldnt ask for a better olympic experience
5122211 we would expect another earnings upgrade just on the back of the contract wins
5122212 there are a number of buyers that are coming in in anticipation of autonomy joining the top persons club so the stock is moving up strongly and there is a volume of trade
5122213 once it is into the ftse 100 the index buyers will get involved pushing the price up again so quite a few of those going along for the ride will make a nice profit
5122214 you can see the consumer driven and financial service verticals having a pretty bad time whereas the news from companies like autonomy and logica is positive
5122215 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5122216 it required the company to retain all the pension liabilities for current and former employees of the retail business this is unacceptable to the board
5122217 its like when youre chasing a beautiful woman and you slap on the cologne and for a short while it is the most important thing before a big fight everyone just wants to know the answer to one question whos gonna win whos gonna win and then you move on to something else when you know the answer
5122218 usian has brought excitement and belief back into our sport
5122219 when you look at him you see the most amazing natural talent someone who has so much ability he can surely win on his own terms
5122220 its great to hold the world record and it would be great to be olympic champion
5122221 he was covering a lot more ground than i was
5122222 sellers coming to the market in the middle of the summer holiday season tend to be more motivated london in particular appears to be having its own special summer sale
5122223 some discretionary sellers choosing not to enter the market leaving a higher proportion of forced sellers who price more aggressively
5122224 the number of transactions this year is in danger of being the lowest since 1959 this raises serious questions as to whether any short term incentives by the government or the bank of england would be effective in speeding up the market recovery against the backdrop of the global problems of the credit crunch
5122225 the games in 2012 is going to be an amazing opportunity and has always been my main target not this olympics because im only 19
5122226 my main focus will still be the swimming i wont accept anything that gets in the way of that at all if speedo or any brand are interested id love to have a kit deal because buying costumes goggles hats it gets quite expensive just for one pair of goggles its 25 you dont expect them to be that much its just a bit of plastic youre in the pool four hours a day so you go through a training costume every month they go see through or big theyre around 30
5122227 the heats were so hard and so fast that it was difficult to race hard again within 36 hours
5122228 i said come on then lets go one better she didnt really react by that stage she was totally focused on the job i could have told her that her hair was on fire and she would have just sat there
5122229 im gutted for the crew truly gutted they deserved to win it did spur me on a little bit but at that point i was in the zone only concerned about my own performance
5122230 i was shouting to shane sutton britains chief coach was it me was it me when he said id won i still didnt believe it
5122231 to become olympic champion puts you on a different level to everyone else
5122232 when youre one of the best athletes in your country you feel great but when you come here youre mixing it with thousands of the best athletes in the world and youre nothing until you become olympic champion
5122233 i couldnt put myself through that stress again im happy with my lot besides i was never good at any sports i dont think im that good at riding a bike its just hard work and determination that has got me here at least ill be able to relax now i didnt want to carry on for another four years fighting and fighting for that one step further now ill just see what limits i can push myself to as a bike rider to see if i can be like bradley wiggins or chris hoy that would be the ultimate
5122234 dan has been with me from the beginning and has got me through the toughest times
5122235 i definitely wouldnt be in this position if it wasnt for him the thing i was most gutted about was not being able to share the experience with him at the very last hurdle
5122236 im going to be in a position where all the other athletes have medalled
5122237 my motivation will be to make sure that im not the loser in the team
5122238 we have a great model a great system theres good camaraderie in the squad and nobody wants to be a failure we have the best of everything and thats why it works ive been involved in two of the top sports and theyre worlds apart uk sport should look at the success were having and model it if other sports dont learn from us were not going to dominate at the london games
5122239 the success of any kind of socialepidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social skills
5122240 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5122241 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5122242 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
5122243 the juxtaposition of an oil refinery and a neighbourhood was the biggest eye opener for me
5122244 just knowing that their backyard was literally an oil refinery its inspiring and awing at the same time
5122245 the unintended consequence of even a single failure in a well intended system or device we might provide could result in significant legal exposure that could financially ruin a company northrop grumman president ronald d sugar said in congressional testimony
5122246 in theory we can find out which country the camera was sold in and in turn the warranty and service center records in that country could be checked
5122247 it would take a lot of work but theres a good chance they could find him or her
5122248 the exif data is like the pictures dna you cant switch it off every image has it some software can be used to strip or edit the information but you cant edit every field
5122249 if bloomsbury were to pursue an action it would more likely be a civil case in which case any damages would be assessed according to the loss in book sales

5122272 stacey andrews number one miles gershan number seven paul nolan number twelve
5122273 madeline oppenheimer do you know that using a pencil as a weapon constitutes suspension for a violent act
5122274 excuse me im going to have to call your mothers

5122280 no well yes but thats not what i was thinking it means that bad luck didnt kill her i didnt kill her paul didnt kill her
5122281 okay as corny as this sounds and i hate to preface this with as corny as this sounds but i love that you dont think before you do anything i mean you dont let anything restrict you
5122282 i mean what weve been together for almost a year now and i was hesitant about it at first but
5122283 i think it sounds like popcorn kernels in a microwave when they hit the hottest heat
5122284 i think it sounds like when im taking a shower and i turn on the water
5122285 fine maddie it sounds like love the rain sounds like love
5122286 i mean we can drive down to lakeside right now
5122287 everything and everyone has a specific meaning to decipher for itself or theirself i cant answer that for you
5122288 but you wouldnt have me any other way would you
5122289 i still have much to learn from you dont i
5122290 yes i believe you do and i from you as well dear dont forget
5122291 i still dont know what you would learn from me that would be of value
5122292 were of the same mind and spirit love i learn everything i can from you for example i re learn the shadows and contours of your face every morning at sunrise i re learn that your hair is a different shade at every hour every minute every second even
5122293 ahh no no that is for you to find out yourself
5122294 yes because youve become everything ive been aspiring for everything ive been working towards
5122295 and i you even if sometimes i believe it was in vain
5122296 nothing is in vain if you can feel the way that we do today

5122306 ive just never met anyone like you youre not mainstream youre yourself and you dont seem to care
5122307 thats what infuriates people so but i am more complex than i seem if it is even conceivable at this point

5122309 we all have much to learn from one another its just a matter of finding that out for yourself

5122345 we should note that the contraction may be a reaction tohigh growth in the preceding quarter but as weve said we thinkthe economy is weakening and downside risk exists it is naturalthat consumers practice thrift when prices are rising
5122346 there are many strong points in the japanese economy overall i believe the japanese economy will be firm even thoughthe economy contracted in april june it would be more accurateto think that it wont last long as the economy slumped onexternal factors

5122360 many airline business models cease to work at 135 a barrel oil prices
5122361 as we got there a twin engined aircraft came over our heads flying quite low enough for us to notice and look up
5122362 literally as we watched it come over our heads more or less like a flash what i almost thought was a microlight came across and the twin engined plane smashed into it straight on and totally destroyed it it just fell apart as if it was made of balsa wood it was unbelievable
5122363 the twin engined aircraft banked heavily to the left and i think its right propeller came off
5122364 we thought it was trying to recover you are just thinking go on it seemed to get its height back for a little bit but then it nose dived into the trees we heard a deep rumble as it obviously crashed
5122365 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5122366 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised the plane was going down
5122367 iran said it had sent a rocket carrying a dummy satellite into space on sunday triggering fresh concern in washington that the technology could be diverted to ballistic missiles the launch is likely to further exacerbate tensions with the west over its nuclear drive which irans arch foe washington and its allies claim is a cover for atomic weapons ambitions

5122378 this is an old art falconry in the truest sense of the word is hunting wild game with trained birds of prey
5122379 what you see here is falconry techniques used to demonstrate the birds capabilities and to give you an up close look at birds of prey which are magnificent
5122380 weve always seen those types of exhibits on tv this seemed like it would be a nice thing to do and see the birds in action theyre beautiful
5122381 a bird can be trained not only to not fear you but to actually come to you for a reward why it works i dont know quite frankly its still a miracle to me
5122382 thats because this is a lot more demanding than your average gun hunt
5122383 the race of legends is a highly thrilling event so adding a current f1 driver like timo glock to the mix allows fans to witness a variety of skills of some of the top drivers in the world both past and present
5122384 its a great pleasure for fans and enthusiasts to see their heroes still racing at the highest levels as we saw out here today they remain as competitive as ever
5122385 an event like the monterey historics is an enthusiasts dream you can see people licking their chops when they walk around
5122386 to be here and to listen to the roar of the engines on all these race cars makes my heart skip a beat
5122387 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5122388 being pain free in the later part of the year i started feeling confident from may on its getting better and better and now in the offseason i know what to work on for next year
5122389 the rapid acceptance of the heavy putter among pga european tour players and european golfers of all handicaps clearly validates it as a huge competitive advantage
5122390 the heavy putter is also a success at retail in europe and worldwide where merchandisers report quick inventory turns
5122391 is there any age that a person feels less sure of themselves than seventh grade
5122392 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5122393 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5122394 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5122395 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5122396 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5122397 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5122398 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5122399 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5122400 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5122401 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5122402 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5122403 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5122404 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5122405 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5122406 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5122407 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5122408 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5122409 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5122413 el lenguaje tiene una funci n comunicacional que en los j venes s cumple con esa tarea pero lo preocupante son los nuevos c digos en los mensajes por celular todo lo que es el chat donde se escriben abreviaturas hay palabras entre los j venes que solo ellos le dan un significado pero no es el convencional son c digos que mezclan con palabras abreviadas con im genes o s mbolos gr ficos que vienen en una oraci n pero que una persona ajena a ese grupo no entiende
5122414 las medidas encaminadas a incrementar la transparencia y la confianza de las que tanto ha hablado la casa blanca no llegan a materializarse

5122438 i wont win cool points for this but mccain is doing excellent so far better than obama
5122439 why mccains win wasnt really a win at the fbf
5122440 main force units of the united states army liberated richmond and shortly thereafter president lincoln visited the city greeted by cheering richmond residents lining the streets
5122441 sure the confederacy had slaves but other people in the world did bad things too
5122442 the north only made the south give up its slaves why didnt they give up their own
5122443 the confederacy may have done some things which by todays standards are bad but you havent denounced every evil done by anyone ever therefore you have no right to talk about it
5122444 about every generation or so new historians not unlike new scientists try to make a name for themselves
5122445 didnt the north have slavery before during and after the wbts wasnt west va brought into the union as a slave state
5122446 after the emancipation proclamation wasnt it the yankees who were deserting at a rate that has never been equaled
5122447 wasnt it union states that had laws barring blacks from entering the state lincolns own illinois comes to mind
5122448 one of those who radically changed his views was marcus spiegel the highest ranking jewish officer to serve in the civil war
5122449 i am sick of the war i do not want to fight for lincolns negro proclamation one day longer
5122450 since i came here i have learned and seen more of what the horrors of slavery was than i ever knew before i am in favor of doing away with the accursed institution i am now a strong abolitionist
5122451 any people anywhere being inclined and having the power have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government and form a new one that suits them better
5122452 you and i both anticipated that the cause of the country would be advanced by making the attempt to provision ft sumter even if it should fail and it is no small cconsolation now to feel that our anticipation is justified by the results
5122453 nj was the only northern state that had slaves at the beginning of the war
5122454 also at the beginning of the war the only northern state that still had slaves was new jersey
5122455 that part about nj being the only union slave state
5122456 slavery was the cause of the civil war which the south started
5122457 no ammendment shall be made to the constitution which will authorize or give to congress the power to abolish or interfere within any state with the domestic institution thereof including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said state
5122458 a sizeable number of offenses are clearly war related conspiracy 22 treason 17 rebellion 12 holding an office in the confederacy 9 serving with the rebels 4
5122459 some people are offended to think that they are related to monkeys it shames me to acknowledge that i am related in a purely evolutionary way to people like this
5122460 its so stupid there were men who didnt fight in the war those too old or too young for example and besides men arent the only ones who can use guns to enforce oppression
5122461 south is racist the south had slaves south south south
5122462 complaint is made to me that you are forcing negroes into the military service and even torturing them
5122463 our country owed all her troubles to him and god simply made me the instrument of his punishment
5122464 ian as i said i dont have the numbers in front of me it just seems using the high number that 15 000 or the same as give or take 1 500 white men per state is low with that few of them not voting why were so many blacks yankees and pro union people in offices of power
5122465 if any one attempts to haul down the american flag shoot him on the spot
5122466 how lincoln can be blamed for fort sumter when it was buchanan who sent the ship which attempted to resupply the united states garrison there
5122467 ian i would like to believe you but i dont heres why
5122468 the corwin ammendment original 13th ammendment was offered to the 7 seceded states by lincoln to entice them to remain
5122469 13th amendment is its ties to the actual 13th amendment
5122470 war was over states rights or war was over slavery
5122471 the sole object of this war is to restore the union should i become convinced it has any other object or the the government designs using its soldiers to execute the wishes of the abolitionists i pledge you my honor as a man and a soldier i would resign my commission and carry my sword to the other side
5122472 the northern onslaught upon slavery was no more than a piece of specios humbug designed to conceal its desire for economic control of the southern states charles dickens
5122473 we were not rebels we did not fight to perpetuate human slavery but for our rights and privileges under a government established over us by our fathers and in defense of our homes
5122474 had the confederates somehow won had their victory put them in position to bring their chief opponents before some sort of tribunal they would have found themselves justified in stringing up pres lincoln and the entire union high command for violations of the laws of war specifically for waging war against noncombatants
5122475 any society which suppresses the heritage of its conquered minorities prevents their history and denies them their symbols has sewn the seed of its own destruction
5122476 no man is good enough to govern another man without that others consent
5122477 to be a virginian either by birth adoption or even on ones mothers side is an introduction to any state in the union a passport to any foreign country and a benediction from the almighty god

5122484 as parents the joy of bringing a child into the family can make us forget that for the child adoption also represents losing his or her birth family
5122485 even at as young as three and four years old adopted children understand that their family story is somehow different from those of other children
5122486 it sounds like all the residents and campers have been accounted for
5122487 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5122488 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares 50 million acres across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5122489 in over 70 percent of the cities studied more than half of urban agricultural land is irrigated with wastewater that is either raw or diluted in streams
5122490 in the face of water scarcity generally and a lack of access to clean water urban farmers will have no alternative except to use diluted or untreated wastewater or polluted river water
5122491 the reintroduction of turkey oak and the re invasion of gall wasps into northern europe may simply represent restoration of a previous natural situation

5122499 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

5122501 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5122502 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5122503 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5122504 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5122505 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

5122516 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5122517 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5122518 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5122519 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5122520 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5122521 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5122522 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5122523 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5122524 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5122525 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5122526 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5122527 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5122528 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

5122538 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5122539 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5122540 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5122541 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5122542 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5122543 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5122544 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5122545 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5122546 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5122547 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5122548 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5122549 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5122550 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5122551 o sinal ficou verde ou al m do bem e do mal
5122552 it was the perfect start and more than i expected
5122553 but well need more quality in the future if we want to be champions well need more than this
5122554 i think the owner will be happy like the other fans
5122555 everything wed worked at in training for the last 20 days we did out there on the field portsmouth didnt think wed play like we did because we were more aggressive than last season i think they were surprised by our team they didnt expect us to play more aggressively than last season but i dont think manchester united will be scared they are not our opponents next week after all maybe wigan chelseas next opponents might be
5122556 i told him to make people believe in him and he did that
5122557 their movement was too much and we couldnt stay with it they play from everywhere and we just stood and watched them i made a rod for my own back by buying two strikers in jermain defoe and peter crouch and i had to play them theyve not come here to sit on the bench but i dont think you can play 4 4 2 here you get overloaded in midfield and thats what happened to us
5122558 ive turned down the opportunity to go elsewhere before and im happy where i am
5122559 its not a case of the grass being greener its difficult at the moment ive lost sulley muntaris energy and pedro would have played today if he was still here but well be better than that for sure the top four are on another level and no one will break into that group this year still you dont play chelsea every week weve got a nice easy game next monday against united after all
5122560 they told us that under any reasonable calculation the rest of them would go pretty quickly
5122561 four out of seven toilets were not flushing so for the comfort of our passengers we diverted to adelaide

5122563 we did ask for more red wine to be brought on board but it was felt not to be a priority
5122564 channel 7 had a very deliberate strategy with the yum cha program and that was to dumb it down in order to make it digestible for non sporting viewers
5122565 everything on that program was scripted and sonia has executed the strategy exactly how seven wanted it to play out

5122568 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5122569 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5122570 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5122571 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5122572 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5122573 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5122574 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5122575 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5122576 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5122577 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5122578 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5122579 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5122580 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5122581 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5122582 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5122583 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5122584 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5122585 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5122595 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5122596 i havent seen it yet on tv but everyone tells me it was a stonewall penalty
5122597 i like charlie richmond i think hes a decent referee but i have to put this down as a mistake by him in the penalty area anything else doesnt bear thinking about

5122649 it appears to me that having developed in an environment that prohibits any sort of critical thought especially in the fields of religion and politics arabic has become a means to avoid dealing with difficult issues in some arabic speaking countries asking how and why can get you imprisoned therefore the more skilled you are at it the better you are at avoidance by using ever bigger words and ever more flowery metaphors in the end it just becomes one big exercise in denial

5122706 on the 6th and 9th of august 1945 the united states of america used atomic bombs to destroy the japanese cities hiroshima and nagasaki in that first atomic blast used in war hiroshima ceased to exist three days later nagasaki suffered the same fate the sudden intense heat up to 4 000 degrees centigrade or 7 232 degrees f the blast and the atomic radiation struck down men women and children the aged and the infants stripping off their skin burning deep into their flesh sucking out eyeballs and bursting bellies penetrating to the marrow of their bones glands lungs hearts and brains the exposed flesh of the victims of blast and heat began at once to putrefy and was soon infested with maggots those who appeared to be recovering from their injuries burns and decaying flesh began to develop delayed effects such as keloids cataracts leukemia cancer and pernicious diseases the residual radiation struck down even those who came into the city to search for their relatives and friends some hibakusha lost all of their relatives at once many are still tormented by guilt for having been unable to help loved ones who were trapped by debris from the blast and burned to death before their eyes the atomic bomb was dropped suddenly one day without warning the entire population of the city was either killed or injured without distinction between civilian and military personnel the whole area was completely destroyed during the first 2 weeks after the bombing the death toll including those who were fortunate enough to die instantly and those who were crushed to death under the debris rose to more than 150 000 160 000 by the end of december 1945 a total of 190 000 230 000 died of atomic diseases whose symptoms include fatigue nausea vomiting high fevers diarrhea bleeding loss of hair and leucotenia many survivors suffer after effects such as leukemia and cancer the death toll is still rising the damage done to the physical and mental health and livelihood of the hibakusha far from being lessened by time has resulted in a vicious circle of illness and poverty their sufferings have increased one after another and the longer they live the more unbearable their agony becomes unable to work having many health problems and no relatives their troubles become more pressing as they get older furthermore the anguish of the hibakusha has been intensified by the armaments race and the repeated nuclear bomb experiments carried out in defiance of the earnest wish of the hibakusha that no one else in the world go through the same agony as theirs again

5122737 i have asked roads service to carry out a full investigation into the underpass flooding
5122738 the contractors are still working here and we will want to be talking to them to ascertain how it became flooded and why it didnt clear itself quickly as well as to make sure that this sort of thing doesnt happen in future
5122739 as a result northern ireland water was able to deploy resources and contractors throughout the event and around the clock

5122761 p e i is really a national leader when it comes to wind energy
5122762 that potential can be found all over atlantic canada and when you couple that with the hydropower in newfoundland you have nuclear power which is clean energy coming out of new brunswick and they also have wind potential as does nova scotia
5122763 what we need to do as weve been able to do with the atlantic gateway is bring the four provinces together to have a meaningful discussion on how we couple that or bundle that natural green energy potential and look for markets such as the new england states
5122764 its entirely in keeping with the federal governments national plans to reduce greenhouse gas and become less reliant on fossil fuels particularly coal in nova scotia and move towards that clean renewable green energy

5122773 we had a great day in the office saturday and didnt have a good day in the office today
5122774 its tough i havent decided yet whether i will continue rowing or not
5122775 its been a completely different experience for me this time it was really important to me to come back and race the womens eight again
5122776 this time we were much more in the race it was important to come back do it again and get it right
5122777 it was outstanding the results and we did draw a lot of inspiration from that but maybe we used up a bit of our energy with the emotional highs and lows
5122778 i was in the crew and we lived that experience together
5122779 hopefully we are all stronger people for it this is a great crew of girls and the whole rowing team has really stuck together this time round

5122781 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5122782 we were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail insp rooney said

5122789 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation now is substantially driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
5122790 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of globalized corporations than many millions of poor farmers living on the frontier
5122791 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
5122792 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
5122793 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
5122794 environmental groups are using carrots as well as sticks many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010

5122798 it is important for motorists to insure their cars for the amount that adequately reflects its market value this is important if motorists are not to suffer financial loss if their cars are not adequately insured many car owners dont understand that there are three different amounts for which a car can be insured market retail or trade however there are pros and cons to each and it is essential to understand what they are
5122799 motorists must at all costs avoid insuring their car below the actual value in an effort to save on insurance premiums if you do have to make a claim you could then find yourself significantly short on the amount that your insurance pays out compared to the actual amount it will cost to replace or repair your car

5122805 they have to be post pubescent and there isnt the funding in nsw to actually do surgery on adolescents
5122806 part of the nsw health plan is looking towards funding some of that so we may actually see an increase in surgical measures for severely obese older adolescents
5122807 theyre actually too young to be making a lot of the decisions around what they eat and what they do
5122808 so its a family focused thing to encourage a change in the whole family
5122809 were bombarded with advertisements and easy access to high energy density foods
5122810 we have more and more screen activities and we have less and less actual physical activity so the combination tends towards gaining weight
5122811 it is much more difficult once youve got established obesity to actually reverse that
5122812 so it would be nice to try and prevent it in the first place but at least this is a start
5122813 would eliminate the dilemma of having to choose between responding to a sudden threat either by using nuclear weapons or by not responding at all
5122814 the doctrine for its use immediate notifying of launches against countries and installing devices such as monitoring systems to increase confidence that conventional warheads had not been replaced by nuclear ones
5122815 the risk of the observing nations launching a nuclear retaliatory attack is very low
5122816 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5122817 we have been supportive of democratic elections that took place in pakistan in fact advocated for them
5122818 in todays and yesterdays clashes at least 23 people have been killed on both sides and 28 others were injured

5122820 about an hour ago and you were right theres a fairly continuous stream of subatomic particles coming out of it i think its degrading
5122821 monsters from the eighth dimension or something i think were about to get overrun
5122822 okay theres some muons like i said but were getting readings on others theyre not anything i recognize not mesons not quarks very high mass id guess they might be bosons
5122823 not the big particles the muons id have expected neutrinos
5122824 i dont happen to have a neutrino detector on me at the moment
5122825 the japanese have one down to oh the size of a container car or so
5122826 maybe we can borrow it but the rest makes sense if its degrading into the universe its probably going to increase the charge of each of the released particles that means you get small gates at first and larger ones as it continues to degrade or maybe theyll go further and further away and the first gates that would open would be nearby finally things are starting to make sense
5122827 round up the spout cocked not on safe touch the trigger and it fires just remember to point it at the bad guys

5122829 i think thats a bad sign well talk about this later okay
5122830 something like that and increasing charge larger gates or further away as time goes by
5122831 this is the nsa were watching the news where are you

5122855 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5122856 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5122857 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5122858 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5122859 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5122875 i think its pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
5122876 pass on as much of the cut as we prudently can
5122877 i dont know of any legislation that says that the reserve bank actually sets interest rates for commercial operations in this country
5122878 a substantial proportion of their borrowing costs come down when the rba takes the decision to move rates down
5122879 the treasurer should be meeting with the ceos of the four major banks and telling them directly to pass on in full any cut in official interest rates

5122896 you must understand there are a large amount of troops
5122897 we were the first in so well be the last out
5122898 it has not started yet what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
5122899 the tv centre in gori has been blown up and they are now broadcasting russian radio
5122900 the pattern that we see on the ground is unmistakeable
5122901 systematic destruction of our military infrastructure and a seemingly random but no less painful degradation of our civilian infrastructure
5122902 they didnt manage to destroy the country to destroy the government to realise their wishes and dreams
5122903 i am going to get some advice but i think i might wade in here to set some of the record straight with the media
5122904 we are being crucified on why the taser usage and our members actions at the preliminary stages
5122905 just watched the taser video on bbc tv in australia
5122906 and we hope that when more of the facts are made public it will present a clearer picture of truly what happened
5122907 sgt pierre lemaitre should be fired for purposely misrepresenting the facts and suppressing the video on a false premise
5122908 it appears you have been caught in an outright lie
5122909 in the world of communications police have often been criticized for not giving details and or information regarding an incident resulting in allegations that we are hiding something
5122910 as for myself as a spokesperson in the future i will consider saying that we have no comment theres an ongoing investigation and weather the storm of media criticism that we are not forthcoming
5122911 we have to ensure that we have an open relationship with the media because we rely on the media to get the message out to the public
5122912 so how are you going to lie your way out of this one
5122913 when will charges of manslaughter be brought against the officers
5122914 seeing as there will be no proper action taken against the criminals i should hope a similar fate befalls their families
5122915 after the millions of good things that we have done it was very disheartening to see that level of backlash and anger from the public
5122916 i see on the news eight people have died in five years thats about 1 5 a year how many would have died if we didnt have the taser
5122917 of those eight how many had pre existing conditions that likely contributed if not were the cause of death
5122918 stand by for the autopsy results we might be in for a surprise like tasers didnt kill this guy pre existing medical conditions and or drugs in the system wait and see
5122919 in an unprecedented action and in contradiction to his request of the prior week
5122920 this left no legal basis for the videotape to be held
5122921 historically public services were delivered by the man from the ministry who was white and heterosexual and got the 4 30pm train back to tunbridge wells every afternoon ben summerskill said

5122929 we are pleased with this increase as it shows that people are beginning to have the confidence to report what is really happening
5122930 with the exception of very recent immigrants most report that a large proportion of their closest friends are non muslim and by nearly 2 to 1 63 percent 32 percent muslim americans do not see a conflict between being a devout muslim and living in a modern society

5122935 es una ceguera que hay que combatir de manera clara recordando lo que significa para un pueblo equivocarse en t rminos de corrupci n en violencia en restricci n de las libertades en frustraci n
5122936 los pueblos a veces se equivocan y a menudo la pagan caro por regla general los pueblos tienen los gobiernos que merecen tener aunque luego se arrepientan

5122940 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5122941 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5122942 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5122943 theyre a very close knit family and of course its just completely devastated the family
5122944 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
5122945 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point
5122946 there was nothing in that field to indicate shed ever been there
5122947 i feel it most when we eat together because the food on the table is not enough
5122948 so i decided to have ligation because life is hard
5122949 the lack of an unambiguous population policy reflects a lack of seriousness in promoting long term economic growth and poverty reduction
5122950 our studies show that if the philippines had followed the population growth trajectory of thailand between 1975 and 2000 the per capita income would have been at least 22 percent higher and there would have been 5 million less poor people
5122951 the catholic church knows how to mobilize its members not to vote for anti life politicians
5122952 some priests and some lay ministers were calling me an abortionist they were calling me a worker of satan
5122953 one of the women leading our workshop told us the pill had given her varicose veins diabetes and made her deaf in one ear
5122954 the general aim is to improve on your personal best break the philippine record if you can the sea games record and take it from there
5122955 my greatest moral failing and i am a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5122956 perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest although weve been the best at it

5122958 our dealers and partners are critical to our leadership in the global marine industry
5122959 our reputation along with the reputation of our dealers and partners relies on our ability to evolve with our industry by providing the most up to date training around the marine industry through mercury university we are arming our dealers and partners with valuable tools and services they need to achieve their business goals mercurys ongoing investment in technologies and services that benefit our dealers and partners is a significant competitive differentiator and a primary reason we have expanded our leadership in this industry
5122960 talent management is moving beyond the corporate boundaries of employee training and becoming an important piece of an organizations extended enterprise
5122961 we understand that dealers and partners are critical to a companys business and by giving mercury university the tools and technology to train and test their business partners regardless of location time or on line status they can be confident their companys reputation and products continue to be the best in the industry
5122962 lord if my brother keeps on sinning against me how many times do i have to forgive him seven times
5122963 but seventy times seven because the kingdom of heaven is like this
5122964 then the man went out and met one of his fellow servants who owed him a few dollars he grabbed him and started choking him pay back what you owe me he said his fellow servant fell down and begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back but he refused instead he had him thrown into jail until he should pay the debt when the other servants saw what had happened they were very upset and went to the king and told him everything so he called the servant in you worthless slave he said i forgave you the whole amount you owed me just because you asked me to you should have had mercy on your fellow servant just as i had mercy on you the king was very angry and he sent the servant to jail to be punished until he should pay back the whole amount

5122983 if you were looking at where low skilled occupations are concentrated in australia youd logically target the service industries
5122984 the general consensus would be retail is still experiencing significant labour shortages there is still a need to examine arrangements for broadening the recruiting pool and i cant see any reason why consideration wouldnt be given to expanding the program to include industries like retail

5123034 hopefully what were going to bring at brand design is a seamless experience there are lots of digital companies that do customer up communication and a lot of branding agencies that do brand down communication which results in a 400 page book sitting on somebodys desk that youve got to follow what were trying to do now is form an idea and an expression of an idea in one place

5123043 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5123044 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5123045 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5123046 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5123047 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5123048 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5123049 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5123050 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5123051 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5123052 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5123053 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

5123063 were really excited to have a fresh look for the gold rush on the field i think this uniform is going to be the best one weve ever had
5123064 we gave them an intricate design and it sets them apart
5123065 erin wanted to bring back the suede and mold the look from back then to a current look
5123066 we put a lot of things together for this design i was trying to accomplish something that maintained their identity and carried over so they didnt lose their entire image with the switch
5123067 they were very excited to see them and they all screamed when we unveiled it to them
5123068 it was just a major screw up by an employee

5123077 i havent seen this issue brought up before but are some of the basketball players competing in the olympics facing a slight conflict of interest when they play against their nba teammates from other countries for example would chris bosh be hesitant to give jose calderon a hard foul when the us plays spain how would he react if another u s player did it what if nate mcmillan had some inside info about rudy fernandez that would help team usa would he divulge it or try to keep it hidden is there an etiquette about this sort of thing
5123078 this gentleman doesnt understand it is not his to trade
5123079 i dont want to share what i will be talking about
5123080 i dont have it laid out in a concise way to share with you
5123081 we should be a nation of laws under the constitution we should have the rule of law not the rule of man
5123082 i dont know if anybody is going to be listening
5123083 all i know is they offered this free speech thing and i thought i would try
5123084 we will probably have an ecumenical church service and also have an advocate for the sanctity of life
5123085 just what its like to live in poverty and how we juggle things
5123086 the main point i want to make is that our government is not run constitutionally anymore
5123087 typically its only used for their premium content hbo spice etc but the fcc has no authority to tell them they cannot since cable is a private system and not free to air
5123088 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5123089 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5123090 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5123091 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5123092 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5123093 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5123094 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5123095 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5123096 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5123097 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5123098 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5123099 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5123100 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5123101 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5123102 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5123103 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5123104 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5123105 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5123106 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5123107 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5123108 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5123109 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5123110 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5123111 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5123112 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5123113 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5123114 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5123115 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5123116 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5123117 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5123118 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5123119 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5123120 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5123121 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5123122 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5123123 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5123124 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5123125 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5123126 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5123127 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5123128 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5123129 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5123130 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5123131 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5123132 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5123133 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5123134 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5123135 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5123136 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5123137 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5123138 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5123139 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5123140 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5123141 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5123142 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5123143 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5123144 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5123145 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5123146 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5123147 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5123148 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5123149 does the street over have a house number the same as ours
5123150 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5123151 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5123152 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5123153 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5123154 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5123155 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5123156 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5123157 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5123158 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5123159 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5123160 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5123161 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5123162 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5123163 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5123164 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

5123177 the government and nffs shared vision for overcoming the chronic nationwide shortfall of 22 000 seasonal workers in horticulture should be widely applauded given there are benefits for all concerned
5123178 todays announcement is the culmination of three years work for the nff and is a testament to what can be achieved through government industry collaboration naturally this three year pilot will deal with the most critical horticultural regions suffering labour shortages such as swan hill victoria and griffith nsw
5123179 this will be the litmus test for a national scheme to enable horticultural farmers to maximise their growth potential and increase food production as a labour intensive sector horticultures future depends on a reliable seasonal workforce and unprecedented growth is in the offing
5123180 horticulture contributes over 7 billion a year to the national economy yet both swan hill and griffith despite being relatively small areas contribute around 500 million each with conservative predictions of growth up to 1 billion over three years in swan hill alone of course that is premised on the ability to find labour
5123181 this scheme is founded on the principal of mutual benefits for farmers and employees it provides the workforce we desperately need and in turn we provide new skills and training to employees coming to australia skills they then take home
5123182 further the remuneration each temporary employee receives at australian market rates far exceeds what they could earn at home representing a boost for them their families and their local economies while they will take home a significant amount of money even more importantly the experience they gain from working alongside the worlds best fruit and vegetable producers is a vital stepping stone toward ongoing development in pacific island countries
5123183 the nffs extensive analysis to quantify labour shortages proactively drive a solution and develop safeguards to underpin the scheme i think has been greatly valued by the government
5123184 importantly the government has also recognised that the benefits extend beyond just addressing workforce numbers the scheme will build and reinvigorate regional communities across australia generating new services and jobs to meet the influx of employee demand a much needed shot in the arm for local economies

5123193 we will be closed saturday 8 16 08 we will resume our regular hours on saturday 8 23 08 and be open 11am 4pm
5123194 we are best friends to me thats a joy its not only a joy to enjoy life but to enjoy it with someone you love having her in my corner will always be my motivation
5123195 its about life and that you only have one chance to take advantages of opportunities because you dont know when they are coming while youre here you have to take advantage of every opportunity that you have because when its over its over what are you saving it for
5123196 as a rookie i thought this is whats supposed to happen to us and its going to be like that every year when we didnt go back to the super bowl the second year we finally realized it takes a lot of work its tough to get there
5123197 with those guys around me it made me better the way that it did was that they took me to the side and said this is how you do this having the veterans around me i think that helped plateau my career
5123198 it was pressure but i took everything in stride and i knew my ability i knew i was in the room with a bunch of hall of fame guys so knowing that i didnt get caught up in the awe of it i used what they had to benefit me
5123199 to reach that plateau in my career it was amazing
5123200 i was on the outside looking in on what was going on my job was to keep outside containment suddenly gary plummer goes over the top of the pile to hit the running back the ball drops i saw it and reacted
5123201 jim kelly tried to bring me down but that didnt work i took off and started running that play never gets lost in my mind
5123202 every player they will go through the struggle of getting back into normal life
5123203 when football becomes your life for eight years its hard to remove yourself from it because its all that you know
5123204 watching the 49ers practice you get that feeling like you want to be back out there
5123205 of course you understand your age and think do i really want to go through those sore days again but being able to watch practice as an outsider i think is a good thing i can just remember my days and be grateful for them
5123206 when hes out there we feel like we dont have to score a lot because hes not going to give up a lot when hes out there theres a good chance well win
5123207 we have to make a decision in the next day or so
5123208 the last few weeks thats what weve been doing ride the hot hand
5123209 um how many megahertz does your splitter go up to
5123210 oh yeah um we can set up an appointment and the guy can give you a 10 000mhz splitter that we use here at comcast
5123211 exit polls are based only on responses from voters who agree to participate
5123212 was sufficient to overcome any legal challenge that might have arisen from provisional ballots that were uncounted ambiguously marked punch card ballots and long lines that may have discouraged many citizens from voting
5123213 there are lots of land mines out there and someone who is not experienced in running local elections must very quickly educate themselves as to where those land mines are

5123216 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5123217 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5123218 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5123219 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5123220 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5123221 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5123222 this is a planning took where all things are going
5123223 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5123224 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5123225 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5123226 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5123227 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5123228 im okay just got a bit of a bad headache
5123229 i was scared at first because ive just come back from a concussion but well keep our fingers crossed that everythings fine
5123230 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5123231 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5123232 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5123233 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5123234 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5123235 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5123236 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5123237 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5123238 it is a struggle something we must deal with but with enough money and the right time and if we stay the course theres no reason we cant get there
5123239 were going to take our time and assess what further consequences there should be to the relationship
5123240 the facts are that the united states has to work with russia on iran on nuclear problems of proliferation on a whole raft of trade issues at a time in which the united states has a huge domestic deficit
5123241 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5123242 my own view is that the russians will probably stall and perhaps take more time than anybody would like
5123243 i think we just need to keep the pressure and ensure that they abide by the agreement that theyve signed and do so in a timely way
5123244 if i would ask you how fast the american forces can leave iraq the answer would be as soon as we have guarantees for peace and security there the same answer would be toward this situation
5123245 to sign any outstanding agreements as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5123246 the political conditions must be created so that this humanitarian socio economic situation in zimbabwe is addressed as a matter of urgency by an inclusive government
5123247 we need this inclusive government to drive the process of addressing those challenges
5123248 it is critical that we conclude negotiations as a matter of urgency because people are suffering
5123249 one has no business in negotiating if you are not prepared to compromise
5123250 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5123251 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5123252 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5123253 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them
5123254 39 percent of 18 to 24 year olds would consider leaving their jobs if a facebook
5123255 students feel secure to know if there has been an incident we can then go back and look what happened
5123256 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time
5123257 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5123258 unbeknown to the patrol the civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5123259 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present
5123260 it shouldnt make any difference where you live there ought to be a common basis for making decisions about exceptional circumstances and i think anybody who uses the nhs for their care is entitled to expect that
5123261 what patients need to do is to find out from those who are making the decision what the basis of that decision is and if they dont think its reasonable if they dont think it compares appropriately with decisions that are taken elsewhere ask why not
5123262 if you have a patient from cheshire they have a very good record most of the time we apply to cheshire they tend to fund patients that have exceptional circumstances if we apply to the manchester primary care trust then in the eight applications weve made theyve only accepted one for funding in 2006

5123276 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5123277 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5123278 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ews new fall preview issue
5123279 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important information
5123280 sometimes maybe i put off making decisions that maybe i should have taken earlier
5123281 to make decisions in the long term interests of the country you have to take quite tough decisions quite early on so that you can get things done within the life of a parliament
5123282 you appoint good people and trust their decisions but you have to know when to step in william hague has really helped me because he made all the mistakes the first time round
5123283 i absolutely believe that if wed have had that election that gordon brown would no longer have been prime minister and that the conservatives would have been the largest party in a hung parliament
5123284 brown compounded calling off the election by then saying it was nothing to do with the polls which was a massive mistake it was a lie and it was treating people like fools
5123285 it was a big roll of the dice to do it without any notes no autocue no funny business there was a moment when i lost my train of thought but no one really noticed
5123286 i regret that my government driver took some of my papers home while i was on my bike
5123287 como proibir o supremo de usar a caneta os m dicos que se cuidem com os seus bisturis os jornalistas que se cuidem com seus microfones e os ju zes que cuidem com as suas canetas a decis o foi essa
5123288 se eu prender um homem de 1 80m que malha vou colocar a algema e n o importa mais de 90 dos policiais usam carros comuns como n o vou algemar o suspeito ele pode pegar a dire o do carro a arma do policial n o tenho a menor d vida que vai haver uma enxurrada de processos os advogados v o alegar constrangimento vai haver um grande n mero de a es penais contra os policiais os advogados nas defesas v o alegar esse abuso e o supremo vai dar esse subs dio n o tenho d vida que sobra para o policial

5123290 onde est escrito que ou n o perigoso porque ele tem boa apar ncia ou mora em determinado lugar o supremo est discutindo o que devia ser discutido por policiais e psic logos
5123291 por que n o pro be logo o uso de algema o policial federal coloca uma arma engatilhada na cabe a do preso e o leva
5123292 se tiv ssemos uma forma de recorrer da decis o do stf mas s cabe recorrer a deus
5123293 o stf acertou ao editar a s mula porque tratou de orientar para que a autoridade n o repetisse o erro n o proporcionasse o resultado contr rio do esperado que ter a investiga o e a condena o criminal
5123294 o stf editou a s mula para chamar ao bom senso a autoridade policial n o tenho d vida disso
5123295 n o concordo com o argumento de que o mesmo que tirar a caneta de um juiz esse racioc nio parte do princ pio de que a regra devia ser o uso da algema e n o a exce o ela n o pode ser usada como antecipa o da pena ou puni o moral p blica que praticamente irrevog vel

5123316 it is only one to two months old and would not have been weaned yet from its mother the outlook is not good but we are giving the calf its only option
5123317 it cant be fed and in fact we wouldnt know what to feed it
5123318 we are towing its mother substitute out to deeper waters in the hope it may hook up with another whale or may find its mother
5123319 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5123320 we want the palestinian people to understand that they can achieve far more for themselves through a process of dialogue through a process of negotiation through a process of reconciliation than the extremists can ever deliver for them
5123321 this government has blood on its hands because they release these murderers that will go tomorrow to do more terror attacks on israeli civilians and the blame will be on the government
5123322 as i said and one thing will be made very clear georgia will never give up any square mile kilometre of its territory
5123323 no matter what happens we will never reconcile with the fact of annexation or indeed separation of parts of territory from georgia with the attempt to legalize ethnic cleansing and with the attempts to bring georgia to its knees and undermine our democratic system
5123324 i hope that soon youll see broader support for refuges from the international community which will render all necessary assistance
5123325 give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on the 29th of march 2008
5123326 we need immediate withdrawal we need verification of withdrawal and cease fire preferably by un and osce monitors we need humanitarian aid reaching everybody and then in the end we need peacekeepers taking over conflict areas and doing genuine conflict resolution in the interest of all ethnic groups
5123327 we are constantly running into problems created by the georgian side
5123328 and so everything will depend on how effectively and how quickly these problems are resolved
5123329 the international community is clear that south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states fully recognizes this reality and will continue to stand behind georgias democracy and will continue to insist that georgias sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity be respected
5123330 russian peacekeepers have been given no orders to move to these populated areas
5123331 he is ready to resign but he is putting conditions like indemnity for the november 3 action
5123332 back door talks are still going on things have not yet been finalized lets see what happens
5123333 well wishers are trying to ensure that matters are settled amicably through discussions rather than going through a long protracted impeachment process
5123334 the next 48 hours are important if he does not resign then we are ready to move the impeachment motion against him on monday
5123335 yet again the russian president has given his word and i hope this time he will honor it
5123336 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state that is ready to integrate into international institutions of the political diplomatic security economic kind this forward leaning modern russia that reputation is frankly in tatters
5123337 we clearly have seen a side of russia that we had hoped was a thing of the past and we obviously are going to have to re evaluate the direction of the strategic relationship with russia going forward
5123338 and that depends to a considerable extent on their behavior from this point forward
5123339 the numerical strength of peacekeepers to be deployed there on a permanent basis will be increased peacekeepers will be armed not only with small arms and light weapons but with heavy weaponry and will also have armored vehicles and tanks attached to them
5123340 deployment of an additional formation or grouping of forces is specifically covered by this provision
5123341 we will not allow traitors who have fired on their own back into the region
5123342 we are not planning to let anyone in anymore more than 18 000 south ossetian refugees who live in georgia fled and are now in north ossetia we need them to return to south ossetia
5123343 should we let them return so they can shoot us in the back again and humiliate our people the president said adding that a south ossetian border had been established
5123344 it is a consequence of any war any aggression we are treating all cases severely
5123345 only russian peacekeepers will be allowed in south ossetia and abkhazia
5123346 there will be no georgian peacekeepers on south ossetian territory
5123347 cluster bombs are indiscriminate killers that most nations have agreed to outlaw
5123348 russias use of this weapon is not only deadly to civilians but also an insult to international efforts to avoid a global humanitarian disaster of the kind caused by landmines
5123349 a cluster strike in the center of the town of gori killed at least eight civilians and injured dozens
5123350 we did not use cluster bombs and whats more there was absolutely no necessity to do so
5123351 we must have guarantees that peacekeepers will be ensuring peace rather than war
5123352 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5123353 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
5123354 the united states and our allies stand with the people of georgia and their democratically elected government
5123355 georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
5123356 georgia has sent troops to afghanistan and iraq to help others achieve the liberty that they struggled so hard to attain
5123357 to further strengthen its democracy georgia has sought to join the free institutions of the west the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
5123358 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
5123359 we certainly welcome the development we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
5123360 loyalty to the u s and receive material benefits for the americans it is an opportunity to expand its military presence across the world including closer to russia
5123361 this is an additional risk many nato countries are unhappy with this including the germans and the french
5123362 there might be a psychological element in it but talks with poland had been dragging on long enough beforehand
5123363 the deployment of new missile defense elements in europe has the russian federation as its aim
5123364 we will continue working on this issue we are ready to continue discussing these issues with all the parties
5123365 the poles should be thanked for helping reveal the strategic goal of the u s missile defense plan
5123366 regrettably in the extremely difficult situation that has evolved today the american side is aggravating the relationship between the u s and russia
5123367 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
5123368 i bet shes tougher than that she runs with vampires
5123369 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him inspector peter rooney from cooma police told abc radio today
5123370 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5123371 we were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail insp rooney said
5123372 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5123373 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him inspector peter rooney from cooma police told abc radio today
5123374 it is a buyers market and falling interest rates rising wages and lower tax rates are all working in favour of home buyers
5123375 the hospital has recognised as has the state of new south wales that we need to do something and face this problem
5123376 they have to be post pubescent and there isnt the funding in nsw to actually do surgery on adolescents
5123377 part of the nsw health plan is looking towards funding some of that so we may actually see an increase in surgical measures for severely obese older adolescents
5123378 theyre actually too young to be making a lot of the decisions around what they eat and what they do
5123379 so its a family focused thing to encourage a change in the whole family
5123380 were bombarded with advertisements and easy access to high energy density foods
5123381 we have more and more screen activities and we have less and less actual physical activity so the combination tends towards gaining weight
5123382 it is much more difficult once youve got established obesity to actually reverse that
5123383 so it would be nice to try and prevent it in the first place but at least this is a start
5123384 geez dont you think he deserves a little payback this tart is ready to go
5123385 theres a combination of reality and voyeurism that captures the imagination
5123386 if katie was this entertaining when she was actually on the air i might even watch her little newscast
5123387 its nice to be on youtube when i know the cameras are rolling harry shearer im gonna get you

5123390 heh and this gem citing seymour hirsh is like citing the easter bunny
5123391 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
5123392 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
5123393 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
5123394 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
5123395 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
5123396 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
5123397 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
5123398 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
5123399 i wasnt an all around year round swim kid growing up
5123400 they said christine you have a lot of talent you ought to think about the olympics but i was a very reluctant kid it is very hard to make the olympics swimming for the u s
5123401 so i was joking around and said ok sign me up for the olympics ill put it on my list of things to do
5123402 i think this meet has convinced me to swim a little longer
5123403 we could see even a couple years ago that she was a force to be reckoned with
5123404 i think now christine has reached a spot when you realize what you are capable of and it helps you to become even more capable
5123405 i am sure it will hit me somewhere down the road
5123406 sometimes i look back and say i have done a lot this year and sometimes i think its pretty normal i am surrounded by so many amazing athletes im just one of the crowd
5123407 i was just focused on my takeoff i actually touched the wall and found out how she was ahead of me and i was mad i am happy to have the best split of the hundred fly in that pool today all of us had the fastest splits of an american ever
5123408 i have one more session of school left i definitely want to get my degree
5123409 a lot of them are going to be team memories
5123410 the team became really close in the last six weeks i have gotten to know people swimmers who i watched on television close up
5123411 we were going down the second fairway and my caddie mark long said lets say you are four behind
5123412 we were trying to make it as if we were behind all day dont protect anything and fire at all the flags
5123413 he got to 6 up after 15 and i just took my foot off the gas
5123414 in my mind i just wanted to get up as far as i could and basically bury the field
5123415 when i got to 6 under for the day i as doing exactly what i wanted to do
5123416 la eyaculaci n precoz es una de las alteraciones de la fases de la respuesta sexual humana se eyacula antes de tiempo sin embargo es conveniente aclarar qu es poco tiempo pues para unos 20 minutos refleja este estado
5123417 viene a ser m s una causa social y de prejuicios ya que muchos adolescentes cuando se masturban al relacionarlo con algo malo lo hacen de una manera r pida por lo que se condiciona al cuerpo a esa respuesta igualmente r pida
5123418 la sensibilidad es una m s hay hombres hipersensibles sobre todo del glande que con s lo escuchar u observar algo se excitan demasiado en la respuesta sexual influyen los cinco sentidos y muchos responden de una manera r pida a una palabra un beso o a una determinada prenda si se detecta que alguno de esos factores afecta es necesario omitirlos porque aceleran el proceso y entonces hay que descubrir nuevos est mulos
5123419 pero s en la respuesta sexual humana ya que no es igual en uno de 50 a os que en uno de 15 y debo decir que ltimamente se presentan casos de chicos de 20 a os por lo que la edad no es un factor
5123420 puede ser ocasionada por golpes en test culos o pene por tomar medicamentos como tranquilizantes o antihipertensivos u operaciones prost ticas

5123423 only 54 percent of eligible american voters cast their ballots half of them are only voting cause its cool to vote for so and so they arent even up to date on information im personally not up to date on the facts so i dont wanna make a stupid choice for our country i want to vote but only when i know exactly whats going on more ppl should think like that paris hilton said yaaaaay go vote cause its cool and hott she wasnt even registered
5123424 he had a serious knee injury and it becomes a confidence thing whether youre ever going to be able to use that leg right and get your legs underneath you to hit
5123425 its been a long process but he can hit the young man can hit hes having a good year for us and we need it and when he starts using the whole field like he did today hes just going to get better
5123426 hes getting there when you blow your knee out as bad as he did it takes a while i think confidencewise hes starting to feel like he can really be a power guy and all those things we know he can hit so we just keep letting him out there
5123427 i think the one thing is that he gets a little pull conscious every once in a while and today he used the whole field thats the type of hitter he really can be the whole field
5123428 its still broken its only nine days out from breaking it so theres not that much that we can expect from it right now theyll probably re x ray here in about a week or so and see if its been healed and healing and go from there
5123429 no ill probably stay here and at some point ill be able to start rehabbing
5123430 they just kind of asked about what we saw different in him
5123431 like i said he was getting down a little lower with his arm getting on the side of stuff and it wasnt sinking at all
5123432 ben came to us he had been hurt his senior year at the u and he was a talented guy and he fit right into what we wanted to do throwing our ball to our tight ends
5123433 he had a great couple of years for us actually started the super bowl and was a big part of our success he became a free agent last year and cincinnati gave him a nice nice deal which is going to have him set for life financially so we were happy for him and happy to see that but sad to see him leave us
5123434 i was pretty impressed watching the team practice i could really see myself playing with them the team was filled with so much energy even though i was excited to watch them practice i still have to think about where would be the best football program for me and my skills dont get me wrong minnesota will always be an option for me
5123435 me and matt kemp were out there looking at each other when they tied it up saying what the hecks going on its a big emotional swing but youve got to jump right back on it and stay mentally tough in that situation
5123436 weve had to come up big in some situations and when they present themselves dont back down go up there tough it out really grind out that at bat and make the most of it
5123437 were certainly in a good place right now with a lot of confidence
5123438 we expect to win when we come out here i mean its that intensity without being tense which is where you really want to be i like that type of attitude that we have right now
5123439 that was a gut wrencher there when you lose that kind of lead in the ninth inning especially with two out
5123440 and then to be able to come back and win the game what can i cay i mean it goes from tragic to magical
5123441 he didnt just pick me up he picked the whole team up
5123442 thats the type of team we are we play a tough nine
5123443 even when we lose we still put a lot of pressure on the other team
5123444 but we cant even think that far ahead right now
5123445 mon dieu mais cette sale b te est plus quun animal ce nest pas possible cest s r le diable le diable satan en personne basile tu comprends maintenant pourquoi il fallait que je ten parle cest terrible ce qui marrive ce qui
5123446 to crush your enemies see them driven before you and to
5123447 this camp is good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5123448 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing of the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner
5123449 i was letting the tournament slip away on 10 and 11
5123450 im thrilled its a wonderful feeling it doesnt happen very often unless youre tiger woods
5123451 i struck the ball really nicely and putted solid holed some really nice putts today
5123452 how can we trust the objectivity of a report prepared by a task force composed exclusively of pro choice psychologists especially when the chair and lead author has a history of withholding data and findings which may undermine her ideological preferences
5123453 the hospital has recognised as has the state of new south wales that we need to do something and face this problem
5123454 they have to be post pubescent and there isnt the funding in nsw to actually do surgery on adolescents
5123455 part of the nsw health plan is looking towards funding some of that so we may actually see an increase in surgical measures for severely obese older adolescents
5123456 theyre actually too young to be making a lot of the decisions around what they eat and what they do
5123457 so its a family focused thing to encourage a change in the whole family
5123458 were bombarded with advertisements and easy access to high energy density foods
5123459 we have more and more screen activities and we have less and less actual physical activity so the combination tends towards gaining weight
5123460 it is much more difficult once youve got established obesity to actually reverse that
5123461 so it would be nice to try and prevent it in the first place but at least this is a start

5123471 my calf was just so bad i had to stretch it the pain felt like it was coming up from my foot early in the race i had this weird feeling that someone was kicking my foot away while i was running
5123472 i would have walked because it was something that was actually okay walking i havent made the injury worse
5123473 if i felt i was doing some serious damage i would have stopped its horrible when you have to drop out especially when its the olympic games so many people have worked so hard to get me here
5123474 in some ways its almost quicker to keep going because if you stop youre just left out there on your own
5123475 they couldnt have been better conditions when i started to struggle i got a lot of traffic and that was annoying i was getting lots of fumes as well as everything else

5123479 these figures have increased from 15 per cent to 23 7 per cent since 2004 ms nixon said
5123480 we are pleased with this increase as it shows that people are beginning to have the confidence to report what is really happening

5123484 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5123485 we were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail insp rooney said
5123486 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5123487 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him inspector peter rooney from cooma police told abc radio today

5123494 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
5123495 and nothing they say now can convince me that they didnt enjoy it
5123496 today theyre apoplectic over how we supposedly violated their national sovereignty or whatever but believe me the other night georgia was like a completely different country
5123497 we were just minding our own business and they were all like ooh russia come over here and penetrate our borders it was embarrassing im pretty sure they were drunk too honestly we invaded them just to get them to shut up
5123498 you know how it is with former soviet bloc satellite countries
5123499 they like to play coy they say no when they really mean mo ha ha am i right come on up top
5123500 i dont care what signals they were sending to forcefully violate the territorial sovereignty of another country is just wrong and worse makes the rest of us look bad
5123501 people need stories more than bread itself they tell us how to live and why
5123502 it wasnt the lowest of times i was somewhere below that
5123503 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5123504 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5123505 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5123506 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5123507 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5123520 the bottles captured the imagination of the greensboro community and there was no way to escape its affection for them writes 2002 jaycee president randy harris who has just published
5123521 i think you have to give that bottle some credit it tried to keep the tradition alive
5123522 might not be the most pc politically correct thing to do these days
5123523 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5123524 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5123525 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5123526 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5123527 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5123528 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5123529 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5123530 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5123531 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5123532 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5123533 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5123534 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5123535 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5123536 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5123537 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5123538 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5123539 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5123540 who are open to doing something on the production side
5123541 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5123542 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5123543 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5123544 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5123545 since the car is powered by electrical motors found in each of the four wheels
5123546 there is no transmission and you break intuitively by pushing the steering wheel away from your body
5123547 i believe that this design paradox of low weight and large presence could be the way well define premium in the future
5123548 playing with all these great golfers out here and competing with those great golfers i think is going to make me develop my game and give me lots of confidence when i get ready for the u
5123549 i think its a good opportunity to play in this
5123550 i didnt even think about playing this well he added all i was trying to do was not make any mistakes
5123551 the more you play it the more you find out about the course where not to miss it especially said clemsons phillip mollica who won the north and south amateur last year at no
5123552 its going to be more about hitting fairways getting the ball in play off the tee versus a couple of years ago when the rough was down and you could really hit it anywhere out there its going to be a premium hitting fairways
5123553 a system where the wealth of society belongs to those who produce it the working class and is used in a planned and sustainable way for the benefit of all in place of greed domination and exploitation we stand for solidarity friendship and cooperation between all peoples
5123554 capitalism the system in which all wealth and power is held by a tiny group of billionaires and their state is the source of the main problems confronting humanity today imperialist war poverty exploitation layoffs unemployment racism sexism lesbian gay bi trans oppression environmental destruction mass imprisonment unionbusting and more
5123555 we want to speak to the tens of millions of working class and oppressed people who desire real change but will not get it through the capitalist electoral process
5123556 we want to fight shoulder to shoulder with our class the working class in every struggle against the profit system we want to be a catalyst to raise working class consciousness in every arena most importantly we want to spread the ideas of revolution of true change we know that change is possible we know that it will happen we also know that it takes an energetic struggle

5123585 i like that i can do family movies and then more edgy stuff
5123586 id hate to be in a position where you play a cheerleader and so keep getting offered cheerleader parts i mean no thanks i can do a lot more
5123587 id like an oscar i think and id also like to have been the face of a big cosmetics company like chanel or one of the others you know what i am actually going to say id like an oscar nomination rather than an oscar i dont want to jinx it
5123588 i would love to work with her i really like angelina jolie and reese witherspoon i would love to work with a bunch of those people i love to just work with new people in general its always really fun
5123589 if you dont put yourself in that kind of position its easy to avoid
5123590 if you start hanging out with those kinds of people and going to those kinds of things you know thats how you get sucked into it
5123591 that sort of life doesnt just come and find you you have to kind of put yourself around those kinds of people which i dont i have a really cool group of friends and an amazing family so its not something i pursue
5123592 i dont see her that much so the last thing we want to talk about is work we cook and play with her babies they are so cute
5123593 but it is my friends and my family who keep me grounded because none of them have ever treated me any differently since i have been acting
5123594 i dont really think i look like her very much
5123595 but i was on a talk show recently and they held up a picture of me and my aunt together and in those particular pictures we did look a lot alike but i think its mainly the smile that is similar i think it is really cool to be compared to her because shes an amazing actress but i do kind of want to make a name for myself and accomplish something on my own
5123596 i laughed out loud reading the script because i recognised her character in some people i know in la
5123597 i always played like the girl next door so it was cool to get to play someone completely different
5123598 freddie the character i play was very much a laidback version of me and it was a kind of hugh grant walk on walk off role and a little more bridget joness diary and that kind of thing and i just really enjoyed making it
5123599 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5123600 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5123601 its a public attack on women and a form of verbal and emotional abuse
5123602 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting if he wants to come and visit our service im more than happy to have a yarn to him about what hes saying
5123603 theyre very archaic comments i dont think he realises the repercussions of labelling women based solely on their looks
5123604 whatever shall i do now i cannot get to the things in my storage container to sell them and i do not have the money to pay this outright my house is doomed
5123605 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
5123606 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
5123607 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
5123608 councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different
5123609 may have to take action much more often and if necessary put obese children on
5123610 there is a marine recruiter who has changed his mind about the military and is applying to be a conscientious objector
5123611 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5123612 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5123613 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5123614 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5123615 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5123616 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5123617 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5123618 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5123619 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5123620 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5123621 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5123622 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5123623 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5123624 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5123625 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5123626 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5123627 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5123628 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5123629 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5123630 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5123631 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5123632 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5123633 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5123634 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5123635 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5123636 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5123637 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5123638 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5123639 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5123640 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5123641 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5123642 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5123643 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5123644 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5123645 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5123646 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5123647 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5123648 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5123649 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5123650 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5123651 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5123652 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5123653 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5123654 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5123655 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5123656 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5123657 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5123658 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5123659 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5123660 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5123661 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5123662 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5123663 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5123664 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5123665 instead of all the high falutin exhortation about listening to the better angels mr obama has gotta come out here and time is short and emphasise social justice
5123666 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5123667 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5123668 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5123669 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5123670 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5123671 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5123672 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5123673 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5123674 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5123675 if someone can pick up and start over at 30 being through divorce and kids i have nothing to complain about
5123676 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
5123677 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
5123678 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
5123679 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
5123680 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law
5123681 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
5123682 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5123683 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5123684 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5123685 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5123686 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5123687 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5123688 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5123689 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5123690 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5123691 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5123692 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5123693 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5123694 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5123695 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5123696 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5123697 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
5123698 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
5123699 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
5123700 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
5123701 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5123702 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
5123703 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5123704 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue its immoral to keep kicking the can down the road for younger generations to grapple
5123705 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5123706 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5123707 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5123708 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5123709 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5123710 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5123711 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5123712 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5123713 did you know richard nixon is the only president whose formal portrait was painted by a police sketch artist
5123714 not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
5123715 people werent creating and posting videos online there was jibjab a website but that was done by a production crew what youre seeing now are individuals participating in the process and thats really exciting
5123716 so often with these its not the huge production values that make them work
5123717 in a couple of hours we can turn something around its the ideas behind them not the money
5123718 what makes this such a fun election is that there is so much awareness its like when youre at the water cooler and everybody watched the same television show the night before people are just really ready to be engaged
5123719 then of course theres just so much to rip on
5123720 the guy who sits on the sidelines teaching the white guy valuable lessons like bagger vance the big magical brother from the green mile or when shaq played kazaam
5123721 i want to bomb iran using solar powered nuclear weapons
5123722 apple butter will no longer be a second class condiment dinner shouldnt be so spicy sen mccain promises never to negotiate with prussia and yes if elected sen mccain will vote yes on cats being soft
5123723 whenever i get on a plane i know who the air marshal is its always the guy holding the people magazine upside down looking right at me
5123724 looks like the guy at the hardware store who makes the keys
5123725 i have the oldness it takes to protect america honor her love her and tell her what cute things the cat did
5123726 act now and dont delay we know he doesnt have much experience and isnt ready to lead but that doesnt mean he isnt dreamy
5123727 we can start up that rumor about you having a black baby with a prostitute
5123728 but sir it would be healthier for the two if they were separated
5123729 mccain supports universal health care for all current and former pows
5123730 john edwards presidential aspirant and author of the famed claim that there are two americas was apparently only faithful to his wife in one of them apparently he didnt realize that the national enquirer had reporters stationed in the other america where he was in fact having an affair with his videographer
5123731 obamas camp initially agreed that the cartoon was quote tasteless and offensive really you know what your response should have been its very easy here let me put the statement out for you barack obama is in no way upset about the cartoon that depicts him as a muslim extremist because you know who gets upset about cartoons muslim extremists
5123732 barack obama heading to hawaii for a vacation with his family
5123733 republicans say that john mccain will be good for business they didnt say what business but im guessing probably the scooter store doans pills craftmatic adjustable bed and the miracle ear
5123734 people are now talking about the ticket barack obama and hillary clinton would that be a good ticket and i think this would be the first if you think about it first combination of an african american man and a white woman since well michael jackson
5123735 barack obama gave a speech in germany and 200 000 people showed up there were so many germans shouting and screaming that france surrendered just in case
5123736 barack obama said today that he is going to fight for votes in all 50 states yeah thats what he said meanwhile john mccain said hes going to fight for votes in all 13 colonies
5123737 ralph nader in the news this week ralph nader announced that he is certified to be on the presidential ballot in 12 states however doctors say that nader is certifiable in all 50 states
5123738 barack obama still continuing to dominate media coverage the new york times just did a big piece they say that barack obama has been successful in politics because hes a black man who doesnt make white people feel threatened yeah yeah which explains obamas secret service code name al roker
5123739 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5123740 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5123741 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5123742 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5123743 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5123744 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5123745 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5123746 a lot of companies turn to youtube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy climate change or poverty now socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved
5123747 its the companys opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers
5123748 they strengthen their brand by putting a face to things customers can hear and see them talk
5123749 the earthkeeper channel on youtube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change
5123750 the reason we chose to sponsor a contest on youtube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative stimulating methods of communicating their messages
5123751 companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible but they want to sell their products at the same time
5123752 youtube is a new vehicle and companies are offering these types of media therefore the spots are not completely altruistic theres an element of both selling and doing good
5123753 he not only indicated the problem of climate change but he also set a new form of demonstration short clips brief presentations
5123754 no company can ignore the whole climate problem i have no doubt that the pr department of every company is telling their bosses we have to have a presence because its part of being in business today

5123760 people try to put us down just because we get around
5123761 the further down the street you went the badder it got
5123762 in any professional universe only a small percentage gives to presidential candidates
5123763 if its a close election like in 2000 or 2004 the military vote could make a big difference in tossup states
5123764 president bush would likely not have won in 2000 were it not for military ballots in florida
5123765 obamas positions on veterans issues notably the new gi bill have inspired the support of the military and its families
5123766 has been endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
5123767 engaged in a race for flag officers but is rather focused on the entire population of servicemen and women and their families
5123768 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall
5123769 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5123770 dinner pail was a communication of the time meaning lunch box when dinner was lunch time supper was the evening meal

5123772 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
5123773 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5123774 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5123775 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5123776 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
5123777 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
5123778 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5123779 ive taken the action because someone had to this government is trying to force this on the people and someone had to stand up and say that there is no evidence to support it
5123780 on the face of it this applicant would seem to face some insurmountable obstacles in bringing this action
5123781 i want to win if i lose what a tragedy to think about that 2 billion plus that our country will give for no return each year im not going to let that happen without attempting to stop it
5123782 the artists chosen for the exhibition are emerging artists on the international arena they all deal with narratives embedded in complicated structures and layers the content of their works often dwells on escapism versus reality and how a dreamlike world may be a perfect remedy to see just how surreal reality is
5123783 if you got great shoes it doesnt matter what else you wear
5123784 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5123785 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5123786 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5123787 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5123788 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5123789 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5123790 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5123791 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5123792 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5123793 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5123794 man someone really dropped a big one have fun with that

5123809 his logic is that since mugabe is saying the deal currently on the table gives the prime minister a lot of powers then he must assume that position and tsvangirai becomes president
5123810 my confidence is kind of down the hill yeah im just too afraid to smile at anyone even chicks
5123811 i hook up with friends and that and they ask for money or something like that and i always say yes and always go out drinking with them and just waste all my money and stuff
5123812 i havent had a drink for about probably two and a half months and when i do have a small drink now i know when to stop
5123813 i think in the past what we weve tried to do is provide a one size fits all service and weve really realised at mission australia that that doesnt work
5123814 we need to actually look at the individual problems people face and have answers for each of those individual ones
5123815 we will measure all the small individual things which happen to people along the way and then continually measure that over a period of time
5123816 in the past i think probably he would have shied away from accessing some of the services he needed now hes starting to access them
5123817 he is starting to feel comfortable about accessing them and confident about it which means that a whole range of things are improving for him and over time what well see is that he himself will build more self confidence more self esteem from just taking some simple steps and making appointments and going and having appointments fulfilled
5123818 seeing changes in his own life and that confidence then will build to make bigger decisions over time

5123824 open enrollment a policy of admitting to college all high school graduates in an effort to provide a higher education for all who desire it
5123825 we have 260 staff which makes us a fairly big provider of jobs
5123826 youve got to keep on your toes and make sure youre providing a good service
5123827 as one of the victims in this case and speaking for a number of us the sentence was a far cry from what we were hoping for
5123828 the most painful thing to listen to is the watered down versions of what we experienced and the defence making this man seem harmless like an innocent child in a candy store
5123829 there is so much more to this story that will never be heard and that is a real shame especially for those who doubt us or believe what was done was relatively harmless
5123830 myself and all the other girls felt we deserved more however we are very grateful to all who have supported us
5123831 the scary thing is you dont know how they react one child who is touched could suffer major repercussions while for another it could be water off a ducks back for someone else it could ruin their life
5123832 but community expectations moral and intolerance of these crimes say it is not enough
5123833 im requiring a clarification of whether the constitution covers aboriginal people
5123834 the point id like to raise on behalf of my people is that the victorian constitution fails to mention rightful possession of aboriginal people
5123835 legislation does not apply to a specific person described by religion origin colour or any other matter
5123836 youre entitled to raise it at some stage but it should take place in the county court not here
5123837 a lot of students and teachers will attend the service and also form a guard of honour
5123838 st johns will contribute to the liturgy and also have some input with the eulogoy
5123839 james mum teaches at st marys and his brother joseph also goes there so naturally the school will have some input too
5123840 phil was a phenomenal athlete and someone who could be depended on in the most challenging situations
5123841 to his girlfriend rebecca he was known as a gentle man they were a great couple
5123842 to the blokes he worked with he was reliable and dependable and would always go out of the way to make people feel included he would always go out of his way to pick someone up if they were feeling down
5123843 from there he would have been promoted to lance corporal then eventually to corporal as a senior soldier in charlie company he was starting to show leadership at every turn
5123844 he was such a friendly sort of bloke and he was a larrikin
5123845 it was part of his charm but he was a good soldier and a good mate and someone developing into a good leader in one of the most challenging leadership environments
5123846 he will be sorely missed by the defence force and his mates
5123847 the workshop was really great this is my second year at the jazz festival and i really enjoy listening to professionals play
5123848 its great to get the chance to play great jazz with professional musicians
5123849 the band consists of students from year 7 to year 12 and will be playing a variety of music but mainly jazz and swing
5123850 weve had a busy week playing in orange for the eisteddfod and also playing at the snowy mountains so the jazz fest is a good chance to unwind and have some fun
5123851 the students are buzzing and hope to show off in front of a big crowd its also a good chance to practice for the big concert with james morrison in a few weeks time
5123852 the only way in my mind that you can get new water into the murray
5123853 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
5123854 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5123855 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5123856 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5123857 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting
5123858 i dont care who you are or where you been as long as your lov en espa ol
5123859 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
5123860 im so busy i never seem to have any time
5123861 i guess if you want it badly enough youll find the time
5123862 you can work from home as a freelance writer in your pjs getting assignments via the internet i do it every day
5123863 service which i put in quotes because its order at the counter was amazing the bussers manager and cashier were all very attentive now for a real review
5123864 why not we might as well have dinner here while we are at it
5123865 we stop delivery at 7 30 it was 7 20 and there is nothing on their menu or web site about a cut off point for delivery
5123866 vegetarian vegan and kosher what have i gotten myself into
5123867 how many times have you had to deal with these jokes
5123868 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5123869 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5123870 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5123871 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5123872 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5123873 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
5123874 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
5123875 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
5123876 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
5123877 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5123878 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5123879 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
5123880 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
5123881 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
5123882 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
5123883 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5123884 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5123885 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5123886 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5123887 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5123888 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5123889 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
5123890 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
5123891 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
5123892 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
5123893 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
5123894 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
5123895 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
5123896 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5123897 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5123898 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5123899 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5123900 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5123901 im walking back to work from lunch and on the sidewalk of a very busy street in san francisco right at 4th and market in the south of market district i see a huge manta ray on the sidewalk i was one of the first people at the site and a few police officers had just arrived on the scene everyone was just staring at the giant manta ray wondering how it ever got there the guy who called the police said that it actually flapped its way over to that part of the sidewalk from about 20 feet away
5123902 not a news organization but a proponent of a point of view
5123903 evolutionary science is as much about the posturing salesmanship stonewalling and bullying as it is about actual scientific theory
5123904 dad latch hooking is a tough sport im sweating already
5123905 let me bring you both some icewater along with your drinks
5123906 lets do this and lets do that and this and that
5123907 so with the eggs overeasy did you want a side dish
5123908 he wanted the pork jowl you havent put our order in yet
5123909 can we have our check please we are in a hurry
5123910 why dont you just seat us as if there are only 2 of us and then when the other 2 people show up they can sit next to us
5123911 if you guys sit down and order right away then ill be nice to you
5123912 not sure what kinda chicken is mixed in with my pollo verde
5123913 most of this is outside our control and outside the control of former motorway directors
5123914 it is a case of waiting to see what the administrator does with that power before we can act
5123915 if the company is not in liquidation then the eligibility is in question and we might have to lobby the federal government to achieve it
5123916 it would depend on how the former employees are travelling
5123917 if they get eligibility for centrelink payments or get another job if everything is okay and they can afford to wait then we will wait
5123918 the energy coming out of the meeting is particularly strong
5123919 various north west victorian councils all feel tremendous isolation like nobody recognises the problem but this has showed them they are not alone we have the same problems
5123920 in stawell we have about 2000 trucks going through every week that will double by 2020
5123921 we havent got the road capability to cope with that
5123922 north west municipalities have really supported the rail network review
5123923 but its no good just looking at victoria there are 20 different gauges in australia
5123924 maintaining unanimous support for the network and the push for freight to go by rail is important
5123925 we need to form a partnership with governments and grain companies such as graincorp and awb
5123926 we need to continue to put pressure on governments and councils need to work together with governments to fix these problems
5123927 it is no mean feat to get both city and country councils to agree on an issue we need to drive this with the alliance
5123928 governments of all levels need to be careful of signals they are giving out
5123929 i feel we need assurance from graincorp so the silver lines like the warracknabeal to hopetoun line will be upgraded the government needs to see that and then will view the line as being needed
5123930 it was so cool everyone in the band was so talented and everyone was so excited to be there
5123931 at one performance we had all the crowd dancing to what we were playing and everyone was really enthusiastic
5123932 we had this big rivalry thing going on between the australians and the americans in the band so we performed in what we call hubs we were green and they were red and we battled against each other
5123933 it was for the media for the camera crews because it was too hard to get an audience up there but it was fun
5123934 and the great wall was nothing like what i expected it to be
5123935 it was huge and completely untarnished by tourism there were no handrails or anything just the original ancient history
5123936 it was a four hour drive to the great wall and we had a bus convoy of 60 buses and we had a police escort
5123937 they closed off the freeway and so we had this four lane freeway to ourselves which made us feel very important
5123938 all the locals were waving at us as the buses went past it was awesome
5123939 we saw the birds nest and the water cube and we looked at the huge crowds lining up at the gate and just enjoyed the atmosphere
5123940 we also did other things like we went to a heap of markets and sightseeing in shanghai and we saw the world famous shanghai acrobat show which is the best thing i have ever seen in my life
5123941 the silk street pearl market was very overwhelming to start with because there are people grabbing you and basically trying to force you to buy things
5123942 but once you get over that it was fun bargaining and trying to get good cheap things
5123943 we were supposed to perform at the soccer but with the whole security thing they decided at the last moment that we were a security risk
5123944 but it was amazing because china was playing the atmosphere was amazing and when they won as well words cant really describe it
5123945 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5123946 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5123947 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5123948 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
5123949 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
5123950 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
5123951 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5123952 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
5123953 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
5123954 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
5123955 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
5123956 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
5123957 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
5123958 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
5123959 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5123960 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5123961 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
5123962 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
5123963 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
5123964 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
5123965 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
5123966 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
5123967 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
5123968 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
5123969 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
5123970 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5123971 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5123972 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5123973 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5123974 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5123975 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5123976 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5123977 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5123978 and now little children abide in him so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming
5123979 theres a certain question about the removal of a persons livelihood should an animal enforcement officer be able to throw a person out of their occupation on a given day
5123980 give them enough that they can do anything but not enough so they can do nothing
5123981 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5123982 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5123983 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5123984 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5123985 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5123986 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5123987 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5123988 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5123989 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5123990 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5123991 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5123992 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5123993 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5123994 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5123995 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5123996 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5123997 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5123998 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5123999 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5124000 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5124001 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5124002 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5124003 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5124004 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5124005 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5124006 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5124007 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
5124008 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
5124009 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
5124010 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
5124011 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
5124012 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
5124013 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
5124014 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
5124015 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5124016 according to insiders on hand the tight knit ceremony was attended by only about 20 guests or so with
5124017 ellen was helping portia with the train of her dress which looked like a cinderella tutu

5124021 it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
5124022 yes lord yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
5124023 theres a wideness in gods mercy like the wideness of the sea theres a kindness in gods justice which is more than liberty there is welcome for the sinner and more graces for the good there is mercy with the savior there is healing in his blood

5124026 he hasnt mentioned that in any discussions i have been talking to new york but there are six teams i talk to about once a week he still hasnt decided if he is going to play this year thats stage one stage two will be picking a team we havent had that discussion yet
5124027 he keeps himself in shape on his own accord thats not a concern hes in great shape
5124028 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
5124029 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day
5124030 i sincerely believe that this bill puts families at a risk on the highways and would result in death or serious injury
5124031 further if two 9 1 2 foot boats were to meet on an 18 foot strip of road or bridge it would be physically impossible to escape a collision
5124032 theyve been running those boats up and down the highways of north carolina since 1982
5124033 cairns argues we are ceding too much power to the people who know whats good for you and are distracted from real problems

5124040 we had a 122 play situational scrimmage where we had six situations really ended up being seven because we had an overtime where either a team was up a touchdown down a touchdown up 11 down 11 or tied
5124041 the glaring disappointment was the undisciplined penalties in critical situations and thats why we do this
5124042 the guys have to learn how to cope with fatigue and pressure the good teams always execute the simple things at the end of games to win this was a great learning experience and will give us a lot of film to study
5124043 you can play a great game but if you make two bad decisions down the stretch it can cost you the game we were down three and in field goal range on one possession and taylor got greedy and made a throw he would have liked back thats why we do this so hopefully we wont make those mistakes in a game
5124044 im pleased with the offenses ability to make big plays
5124045 were making more than weve ever made thats encouraging on defense we are giving up too many that was our achilles heal last year so we are going to have to watch film and fix our mistakes
5124046 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5124047 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5124048 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5124049 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5124050 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5124051 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5124052 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5124053 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5124054 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5124055 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5124056 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5124057 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5124058 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5124059 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5124060 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5124061 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5124062 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5124063 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5124064 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5124065 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5124066 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5124067 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5124068 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5124069 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5124070 the way bumblebees search for food could help detectives hunt down serial killers because just as bees forage some or water
5124071 i was the third man on the c team azinger said
5124072 i shot 86 77 86 in my first college tournament and i thought that was pretty good and it was on an easy course
5124073 its been like this all my life nothing has changed im getting lost here
5124074 we hope to extract about 30 million ounces of silver over the next 10 years and we hope well find more down there
5124075 they call it a ghost town but there are no ghosts here
5124076 at times one feels very alone here everyone who lives here is a family but we need more people
5124077 the local residents were worried about traffic and noise and their water supply cyanide understandably they dont want their lifestyle changed they were looking for jobs
5124078 there will be changes but were trying to not be disruptive we intend to be good neighbors and shafter will continue to be shafter
5124079 i think the chronology indicates other factors are reducing the flow in the creek
5124080 as you can imagine people who move to a place like shafter value their peace and quiet so in a perfect world id rather nothing change
5124081 i knew when i moved here that it was in a mining district so theres always been a sense we were on borrowed time that the mine would reopen
5124082 the problem with the mining company as friendly as it is its a very big dog for the neighborhood
5124083 when i moved here in 1997 the water was knee deep most of the year
5124084 im against the mine but most people in town are a little cautious about what they say against the mine because they provide the water
5124085 the people who are against it werent here when the mine was running all these years weve had the hope of it reopening
5124086 during the mexican revolution my family came to presidio from ojinaga and in 1917 my grandfather came to shafter to work as the main clerk in the company store where all the miners shopped
5124087 during the depression the mines closed and many people moved away but the mine reopened and it was the best time for the miners they could buy cars and phonographs they had dances and nice gatherings
5124088 the mine was very dangerous it took strong backs and many people died
5124089 they had words howell was ready with his gun and when speed tried to pull his howell shot him some thought he was defending himself

5124097 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
5124098 if you have more then eight funds you should slap yourself
5124099 how many funds should you have four to six should do
5124100 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run
5124101 it does not take much to outperform the average investor all you have to do is put half your money in the vangurd total stock market and the other half in an intermediate term bond fund
5124102 oh by the way i also receive a 100k yr pension paid medical etc
5124103 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5124104 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5124105 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5124106 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5124107 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5124108 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5124109 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5124110 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5124111 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5124112 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5124113 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5124114 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5124115 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
5124116 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
5124117 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
5124118 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
5124119 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
5124120 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5124121 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5124122 wow the new iphone software is really in shambles isnt it

5124124 we trust the review of the 24 000 caseload would mean a vindication of our fathers quality of work at the miramichi hospital
5124125 the results will indeed greatly allay public anxiety and restore a little faith in a profession that has been the subject of intense scrutiny lately
5124126 we have to make savings this was a straightforward switch that had been no detriment to patients at all
5124127 some companies introduce branded drugs just below the generic price to try to increase their share of the market
5124128 if nhs boards are tied into schemes where they use branded drugs they cannot benefit from potential generic price reductions
5124129 prescribing of a branded drug where a generic equivalent is available would run the risk of nhs scotland having to make up any apparent saving as this would result in a shortfall in the negotiated funding package for community pharmacists which is set to ensure the viability of the community pharmacy network in scotland
5124130 the partners at johnnys acknowledged from the beginning they wanted to tie up the space if it was to be vacated to ensure another burger hot dog place didnt move in next door
5124131 i dont want another store restaurant selling something similar setting up shop next door and take those evil street venders and confine them in some woebegotten corner of downtown where they cant interfere with my business
5124132 now he thinks that natalie heard the dinghy banging loosely against the splendor went to fix it and slipped on the swim step knocking herself unconscious and rolled into the water and the dinghy just floated away
5124133 there was no conspiracy nobody walking in on something sexual nothing absurd like that
5124134 he writes that he went through the inquest in a daze and after that he took to his bed for eight days in a catatonic state blaming himself for her death hes never entirely recovered but how can you
5124135 yes of course st fama and st french say so
5124136 i dont know that ones name i dont know that ones name
5124137 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5124138 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5124139 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5124140 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5124141 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5124142 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5124143 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5124144 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5124145 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5124146 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5124147 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5124148 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5124149 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5124150 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5124151 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5124152 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5124153 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5124154 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5124155 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5124156 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5124157 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5124158 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5124159 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5124160 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5124161 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5124162 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5124163 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5124164 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5124165 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5124166 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5124167 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5124168 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5124169 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5124170 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5124171 the unsupported assumption catastrophic global warming follows burning fossil fuels requires immediate action
5124172 the unsupported assumption that the world is more than 6000 years old
5124173 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change

5124186 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5124187 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5124188 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5124189 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5124190 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5124191 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5124192 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5124193 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

5124200 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5124201 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5124202 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5124203 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5124204 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5124205 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5124206 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5124207 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5124208 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5124209 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5124210 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5124211 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5124212 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5124213 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5124214 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker

5124222 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5124223 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5124224 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5124225 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5124226 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5124227 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5124228 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5124229 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5124230 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5124231 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

5124234 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5124235 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

5124247 i want you to come to know of the concern and dedication that this simple woman had for islam as described by those who knew her a dedication that was manifested by way of actions that were very simple and easy yet seldom carried out by those who are able

5124250 she wrote three guides for members who wanted to teach others about islam on the groups website siddiqui explained how to run a dawah table an informational booth used at school events to educate people about and persuade them to convert to islam

5124258 there remains only one obstacle from which the enemy calls him from and this is an obstacle that he must face if anyone were to be saved from this obstacle it would have been the messengers and prophets of allah and the noblest of his creation this is the obstacle of satan unleashing his troops upon the believer with various types of harm by way of the hand the tongue and the heart this occurs in accordance with the degree of goodness that exists within the believer so the higher he is in degree the more the enemy unleashes his troops and helps them against him and overwhelms him with his followers and allies in various ways there is no way around this obstacle because the firmer he is in calling to allah and fulfilling his commands the more the enemy becomes intent upon deceiving him with foolish people so he has essentially put on his body armor in this obstacle and has taken it upon himself to confront the enemy for allahs sake and in his name and his worship in doing so is the worship of the best of worshippers

5124267 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5124268 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5124269 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary

5124349 local government is supposed to be the closet form of government to the community having an active web presence helps bridge the gap between the council and the community
5124350 it is another tool for the community to use in addition to mobile phones and email
5124351 it also enables young people who may be disengaged with the community to have their say in a way they feel comfortable
5124352 local government is supposed to be the closest form of government to the people and yet councils have generally been slow to embrace new technology
5124353 interactive websites and blogs help bridge the gap between council and the community and should be seen as an essential communication tool
5124354 a blog provides an additional avenue for people to leave comments and interact with councillors blogging is particularly popular with younger people and people with disabilities who sometimes shy away from traditional methods of consultation
5124355 blogs differ from websites since they are interactive and encourage people to provide their opinions and make contact
5124356 i am calling on council candidates and current councillors to commit to creating and regularly updating a website and blog just as email is an essential technology for a councillor blogging will be also become critical to communicating with the community

5124378 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5124379 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5124380 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5124381 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5124382 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5124383 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5124384 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5124385 through lack of foresight and planning allowed a range of industries to arise that let people steal music
5124386 it only takes one moment to be proposed to to die or to enjoy the last scrapings of cr me br l e in one moment i could be walking home from the store carrying what seems like sleeping beautys castle when in fact its just a jug of milk and some produce and right when i try to trick myself into thinking that i am actually getting a work out by merely walking home i trip and fall flat on my face groceries fly everywhere and of course when i look up the first face i see is unfortunately the attractive man from next door who looks concerned but is still slightly laughing and by the way
5124387 why is the attractive man who lives next door always slightly laughing at me why cant he just be concerned every time i make a fool of myself why cant being ungraceful and uncoordinated be enough humiliation for just one moment or at least i could be making him laugh by making a witty joke
5124388 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage hes been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5124389 it was just above 0 degrees celsius and it was sunny it had been a sunny day as it had been for the last couple of days
5124390 however people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after the warmer weather
5124391 they are a valuable resource the choppers work with our crews to contain fires but they cant put them out without the guys on the ground
5124392 so they are a sort of insurance policy for our work
5124393 were very happy to have the aircraft back and i think with the current prevailing conditions there is a likelihood theyll be used
5124394 as part of the resources or a tool in the box that firefighters on the ground have one of the options will be to use the aircraft
5124395 there is very much a benefit of having an eye in the sky to provide valuable intelligence back to ground crews and also to provide some safety to them
5124396 it is filled with recycled water which we have trucked in and that allows them to fill up here at the base before they set out on a job
5124397 if were able to provide water supplies close to a fire and we get quick turnaround times we can deliver 2 000 to 3 000 litres of water every few minutes
5124398 that is certainly a great help to firefighters on the ground in controlling any development
5124399 weve had good rain good grass growth both in the open grasslands and in the forest country
5124400 if we do get the right conditions then the intensity of those fires would be greater than we would normally expect
5124401 over the past two queensland bushfire seasons these contracted aircraft took to the skies for approximately 185 hours playing a crucial role in our bushfire response
5124402 lets you and me duke it out some more over whether your marriage is valid even though mine is completely safe no matter what happens and the state supreme court already ruled in your favor fairs fair
5124403 constitutional scholars agree that the amendment cannot be effective retroactively so
5124404 for anyone to say that this is an issue for people who are gay and that this isnt about civil rights is sadly mistaken if you really believe in freedom and limited government to be intellectually consistent and honest you have to oppose efforts of the majority to impose their will on people
5124405 i support the efforts of the people of california to recognize marriage as a unique institution between a man and a woman just as we did in my home state of arizona i do not believe judges should be making these decisions
5124406 fully equal rights and benefits to same sex couples under both state and federal law
5124407 and that is why i oppose the divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the california constitution and similar efforts to amend the u s constitution or those of other states
5124408 the hospital has recognised as has the state of nsw that we need to do something and face this problem
5124409 they have to be post pubescent and there isnt the funding in nsw to actually do surgery on adolescents
5124410 part of the nsw health plan is looking towards funding some of that so we may actually see an increase in surgical measures for severely obese older adolescents
5124411 theyre actually too young to be making a lot of the decisions around what they eat and what they do
5124412 so its a family focused thing to encourage a change in the whole family
5124413 were bombarded with advertisements and easy access to high energy density foods
5124414 we have more and more screen activities and we have less and less actual physical activity so the combination tends towards gaining weight
5124415 it is much more difficult once youve got established obesity to actually reverse that

5124417 any of that permanent water entitlement theyre buying back is unlikely to be able to deliver for quite a long time
5124418 there is enough water in the system just to get a coverage of water on the lakes to minimise the risk of acidification
5124419 there is enough water within the menindee system and you could probably buy enough further upstream if they went into the temporary market
5124420 the murray darling basin commission advises that the existing strategy to protect lake albert from acidification by pumping water from lake alexandrina is proving effective we are expecting further advice on next steps over coming weeks from the commission
5124421 coag has the promise of fixing it in the longer term but if we let it go this summer then we are going on an irreversible pathway
5124422 decisions we make in the next few months we cant go back on so if we let the sea water in or it goes acid sulphate they will have implications for the next generation
5124423 last year on the temporary market there was 220gl traded so you start to think 100gl is not that way out there
5124424 if you go from fresh water to salt water in a few months then the ecosystem is going to go into shock if you can shandy that water then it wont be quite so bad
5124425 they were quite receptive if someone could put 500 ml on the table to thinking about selling their water on a temporary basis that is a damn sight better than they will get for cotton
5124426 if that had gone through the system the lower murray wouldnt be in the state it is in now
5124427 but we have to appreciate the consequences so we have to look at what role can the north play now
5124428 deaths dont happen that much down here and three in one day is very devastating
5124429 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did

5124458 they were having a dogfight between a german plane with two wings that was called the red baron and an allied plane english or american
5124459 one plane was tailing the other and all of a sudden the red baron dipped and went straight down
5124460 didnt president saakashvili of georgia bring some of this on himself by going into south ossetia
5124461 how do you respond to the argument that by pushing for georgia to be in nato by pushing for ukraine to be in nato by putting a missile defense system in czechoslovakia this was seen as belligerent and aggressive by putin and kind of brought him in
5124462 governor romney senator mccain said this week we are all georgians now but didnt president saakashvili of georgia bring some of this on himself by going into south ossetia
5124463 becoming a democracy and standing up for the principles of freedom
5124464 well certainly when his truckload of policemen is attacked by south ossetians and blown up you have a responsibility as a government to protect citizens as he had communities being attacked with rockets that were coming from south ossetia and so he of course took action to protect his nation the russians have been looking for an excuse to be able to punish either the ukraine or georgia or to flex their muscles in the caucasus and this is something theyve been anticipating for some time
5124465 how do you respond to the argument that by pushing for georgia to be in nato by pushing for ukraine to be in nato by putting a missile defense system in czechoslovakia this was seen as belligerent and aggressive by putin and kind of brought him in
5124466 you know what we are going to let the former soviet satellite states become part of nato
5124467 the other side of fandom anti fans non fans amp the hurts of history
5124468 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
5124469 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
5124470 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
5124471 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
5124472 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
5124473 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart
5124474 were all kind of growing together with matt this year we ought to see a better performance by him not only because hes better but because the guys around have improved also
5124475 these figures have increased from 15 per cent to 23 7 per cent since 2004 ms nixon said
5124476 we are pleased with this increase as it shows that people are beginning to have the confidence to report what is really happening
5124477 a political nature along with his clients wellbeing would be raised as part of his case against extradition
5124478 itching to flex its muscles and burning with post imperial hubris
5124479 it is quite hard to argue that there is one law for assisting albanians in kosovo and quite another for russians and ossetians in georgia
5124480 the press release is not a common tool of the russian government
5124481 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him inspector peter rooney from cooma police told abc radio today
5124482 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5124483 we were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail insp rooney said
5124484 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5124485 the hospital has recognised as has the state of new south wales that we need to do something and face this problem
5124486 they have to be post pubescent and there isnt the funding in nsw to actually do surgery on adolescents
5124487 part of the nsw health plan is looking towards funding some of that so we may actually see an increase in surgical measures for severely obese older adolescents

5124495 firstly since mid july the tasman sea has been a breeding ground for low pressure systems
5124496 this in itself is not unusual what is unusual though is the sheer number of large lows that have made their way into the new zealand region
5124497 secondly these lows have often moved quite slowly allowing more time for snow or rain to fall
5124498 thirdly during the last week or so a lot of cold air from the southern ocean has been drawn north and then over new zealand tipping the balance towards snow and away from rain
5124499 this covers the possibility of more snow showers about otago peninsula and banks peninsula and a burst of heavy snow affecting the central north island plateau

5124541 the book is really about salvation about hope amidst the hopeless about compassion not as some kind of religious imperative but as lived experience
5124542 i wish i would have at least caught one camp practice
5124543 i started training a little bit but when i started running again in cleats i think thats when i really aggravated it
5124544 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5124545 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5124546 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5124547 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5124548 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5124549 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5124550 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5124551 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5124552 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5124553 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5124554 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5124555 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5124556 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5124557 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5124558 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5124559 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5124560 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5124561 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5124562 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5124563 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5124564 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5124565 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that
5124566 bad penalties hurt us i was talking to coach wade phillips and we were talking about how its like a turnover we have to stop it we overcame them a little bit but they would catch up to us eventually
5124567 were putting ourselves in bad situations just a lot of little things are holding us back no one can overcome making a lot of mistakes we just need to start staying out of these situations
5124568 we had opportunities and we didnt take advantage of them
5124569 we moved the ball and then there was a penalty and that hurt us those kind of things hurt us but i think were going to be all right
5124570 we practised with denver all week and we did well
5124571 they changed up their whole game plan that is good on their part
5124572 i threw the ball well today and had a good camp this week

5124575 to win the champions league the premier league we need more than this
5124576 i said to anelka today you have three or four chances and you have to make one or two goals for me and for the people because i want the people to believe in you
5124577 today they played very well its important but more important is that the fans of chelsea saw a beautiful game
5124578 i bought two strikers and maybe i made a rod for my own back because you cant play 4 4 2 here unless you play 4 5 1 you get overloaded theyre just too good
5124579 in the context of the season we can come from behind theres no question about that
5124580 there are 37 games left and its not a disaster we lacked real width and penetration to make a make a difference to that game and that was a real problem
5124581 because we thought that would make the guy give up and go away

5124584 for the last few months ive been on a mission to rid the world of the phrase going forward
5124585 you could say this orgy of pedantry was not only tedious but also pointless language changes
5124586 yet protesting feels so good not only does it allow one to wallow in the superiority of ones education but some words are so downright annoying that to complain brings relief
5124587 by contrast there is so much more to object to in going forward

5124591 why do you think were going to because i already know an awful lot of people and until one of them dies i couldnt possibly meet anyone else
5124592 well if anyone goes on the critical list let me know
5124593 you came back to this bar to see me tonight didnt you

5124597 michael has an ankle injury and it has swollen up very badly and hell be out for maybe two or three weeks which is unfortunate
5124598 ryans got a hamstring injury so it was disappointing to get these injuries on top of what were missing anyway i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available
5124599 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5124600 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force
5124601 thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind
5124602 in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5124603 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5124604 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for newcastle united
5124605 the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5124606 anyone can collect players because there are hundreds around but good players who can play at newcastle not everyone can do that

5124620 research by michael e porter a renowned business strategy researcher and consultant and several others has clearly demonstrated what we have long suspected it is easier to innovate in some geographic locations than others this is because these places have more of the necessary supportive environmental factors that lead to successful innovation that do other locations
5124621 there are several factors that constitute a supportive societal environment some of these are a supportive govern ment in term of policies and economic factors such as taxes a positive view of innovation by the society an acceptance of entrepreneurs as being vital contributors a positive view of achievement major research universities and excellent public education system

5124624 candidates should appeal to the voters based on their qualifications for office and their stands on the issues not their religious beliefs
5124625 this event continues the campaign spiral into religious matters americans want to hear the candidates views on important issues such as constitutional rights public education the iraq war and the economy
5124626 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country

5124653 the patrol identified insurgents with weapons on the roof of the compound preparing to attack and in order to protect themselves launched three rockets all of which hit the target
5124654 unbeknown to the patrol civilians were inside the compound at the time the casualties were treated at a nearby isaf medical facility where two of them children remain seriously ill
5124655 isaf deeply regrets the tragedy of this incident when women and children were killed and injured as a result of an imminent insurgent attack from a position where they would have known women and children were present the enemies of afghanistan have yet again shown a complete disregard for the lives of the innocent who they claim to fight for
5124656 a full investigation will be carried out and our sympathies are with the families of the killed and injured civilians at this time we can confirm that four civilians lost their lives

5124667 goleta city alert is a powerful communication tool and greatly enhances goletas existing emergency preparedness and response capabilities
5124668 we used the goleta city alert system to provide information to residents during the gap fire and while we had not officially launched the system we were able to reach out to residents and businesses within a matter of minutes goleta city alert is just another tool in our tool box to ensure that residents and businesses in goleta have the information they need in an emergency
5124669 in addition to sending safety related notifications such as a gas leak or missing person we plan to use goleta city alert to send public interest announcements including notifications of road closures or power outages among other things
5124670 the system is only as good as the information that is entered into it i strongly encourage residents and businesses to register their contact information into the goleta city alert database to make sure they are ready to receive important timely information at any point throughout their day

5124673 now as an afrocentrist i approach the construction of knowledge from the standpoint of africans as agents in the world actors not simply the spectators to europe since afrocentricity constitutes a new way of examining data a novel orientation to data it carries with it assumptions about the current state of the african world one assumes for example that africans are frequently operating intellectually philosophically and culturally off of african terms and therefore are dislocated detached isolated decentered or disoriented one assumes also that this state is useful economically and politically for the west and not so useful for africa and africans there is consequently a difference in opinions about the value of afrocentricity those who have kept us off center seek to improve their position on our intellectual and philosophical grounds by cutting the ground from under any movement that teaches africans to view themselves as centered agents in the world not marginals to europe

5124713 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5124714 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5124715 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5124716 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5124717 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5124718 it is often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and we certainly see that in play here but at another level it is somewhat annoying when you see the over the top rhetoric they utilize and at some level you get mad

5124720 honestly i hope i can get a goal every game

5124722 i was surprised that i was able to get there to the ball

5124724 ive spoken to him a couple of times and expressed my feelings about him being a scorer
5124725 i knew that when hes 100 percent healthy he can score hes getting fitter and stronger and hopefully it can continue

5124769 im about to find out if im freed for the rest of my life freed from the demons
5124770 i cant put myself through that again im happy with my luck
5124771 the pain started in my calf and seemed to come up into my quads i stopped to stretch it but it came back it wasnt sharp pain i would have stopped if it was but i just couldnt use it it was like running on one leg
5124772 i just really wanted to finish its frustrating because i was really comfortable i just couldnt go any quicker cardiovascularly i was ok
5124773 that was the real frustration we knew it was a gamble but i couldnt watch the olympic marathon on tv
5124774 i am absolutely going to carry on until london yes marathon is one event when you can continue when you are older constantina is 38 and the support i would have in london would really help
5124775 if i felt i was really doing damage i would have stopped
5124776 but it is horrible when you have to drop out especially when it is the olympic games so many people have worked hard to get me here and in some ways it is quicker to keep going because you are just left out there on your own if you stop somewhere i did as much as i could at every point i just needed more time
5124777 how long do you think it would take to kill all 150 of us it would be a bloodbath
5124778 when you have good guys with guns the bad guys do less damage
5124779 weve had a very disturbing trend of school shootings in the us
5124780 it is my belief this is caused by making schools gun free zones when schools were made gun free zones they became targets for people who wanted to rack up the body count
5124781 its up there with the worst ideas in the history of education
5124782 you could have a gun accidentally taken away or a gun could be dislodged or discharged while a teachers breaking up a fight in the cafeteria
5124783 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defence if other security measures at the school fail
5124784 officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts
5124785 when you hear about these shootings the reports always start out with this is a sleepy little place nobody thought this would ever happen here

5124908 michael has an ankle injury and it has swollen up very badly and hell be out for maybe two or three weeks which is unfortunate
5124909 ryans got a hamstring injury so it was disappointing to get these injuries on top of what were missing anyway i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available
5124910 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5124911 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force
5124912 thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind
5124913 in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5124914 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5124915 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for newcastle united
5124916 the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5124917 anyone can collect players because there are hundreds around but good players who can play at newcastle not everyone can do that

5124921 when he came home and saw that carol was not the beauty he left behind he started running around on her almost right away everybody around him knew it
5124922 eventually he met cindy and she was young and beautiful and very wealthy at that point mccain just dumped carol for something he thought was better
5124923 this is a guy who makes such a big deal about his character he has no character he is a fake if there was any character in that first marriage it all belonged to carol

5124925 in the rainforest exposure to light during the day causes them to switch off but in caves there is no light to cause that to happen however they switch off of their own accord and they do it in synchrony
5124926 the most unexpected result of the study was that they are out of sync with their surface relatives they glow most brightly when it is daylight outside the cave
5124927 the more we know about the factors that influence the glow intensity the better off managers of these sites will be in ensuring that the display is as attractive as possible while maintaining the long term health of the glow worm colonies

5124939 i assured senator obama that this is a non partisan campaign and that i will do everything in my power to work together with leaders who are willing to solve our immense energy problems
5124940 it would be inappropriate for me to speak for senator obama i have a real sense however that he was very engaged he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing

5124964 im just pulling so hard for mac because look at the way he plays shortstop for us
5124965 he just makes day after day some great plays some plays that sometimes im not sure if weve seen them before
5124966 hes playing hard i think hes getting some confidence in the way hes swinging the bat too
5124967 the way we came out swinging the bats against beckett today is a big lift for us
5124968 to keep having quality at bats and getting guys on base not just getting a big hit but having quality at bats to get those runs in was really nice for us

5124972 now he thinks that natalie heard the dinghy banging loosely against the splendor went to fix it and slipped on the swim step knocking herself unconscious and rolled into the water and the dinghy just floated away
5124973 there was no conspiracy nobody walking in on something sexual nothing absurd like that
5124974 he writes that he went through the inquest in a daze and after that he took to his bed for eight days in a catatonic state blaming himself for her death hes never entirely recovered but how can you
5124975 in the same way that each of us has had to learn in growing up to resist the temptation of wishful thinking about ordinary things like lotteries so our species has had to learn in growing up that we are not playing a starring role in any sort of grand cosmic drama
5124976 here we are sentient beings on this planet in this universe
5124977 i asked him for a one 1 first principle and he provides one that is totally inadequate to the point that he has to smuggle in numerous other concepts that he didnt mention

5124979 well obviously im not a brain in a vat my brains right here
5124980 if the demon were really this consistent in giving us results through which we satisfy our every goal and desire there would hardly be any intelligible difference between what we call reality and the world the demon is inventing for us the cartesian demons construct would be reality in every sense of the word we normally use and since we observe some methods of discovering truth to work better than others and indeed some work best of all a cartesian demon would have to be arranging it this way constructing reality for us solely in accord with a fixed plan it has chosen in that case we have just as much reason to pursue the relevant methods for discovering that plan and to abandon the bad ones so we can gain the reward of a successful life experience from this mischievous demon in other words even if the cartesian demon theory is true nothing significant changes for us regarding method of truth discovery
5124981 i will probably have a barbecue and drop a card in their mailbox saying listen if you want to meet the neighbours come down and say hello
5124982 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
5124983 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
5124984 i never could get the runs in the right spots
5124985 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
5124986 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
5124987 i knew that he was going to be good we both came in together and left together and that was probably the win right there to be able to beat him off pit road once we did that i kind of got up through the esses better than him and we pulled away
5124988 it was a big hit for a bunch of guys
5124989 we were ready to attack i know with nine to go you get up on the wheel and push hard pushing and shoving is ok but that was crazy i guess there wasnt much place to go they kept pushing and shoving
5124990 i knew getting a good start was going to be good and once i got that then it changed all my worries
5124991 sorry about that guys i dont know what happened i must have pulled it loose
5124992 we expect a strong first half of fiscal 2009 having already had a good start to fiscal 2009 mainly driven by continued strong global steel demand and prices bluescope managing director and chief executive paul omalley said

5125007 never once will i downplay his accomplishments by any means what he did is still an amazing feat and will always be an amazing feat in the swimming world and the olympics
5125008 to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when you were tired and wanted to go home and sleep and not train it made those days easier and say i want to do this
5125009 its something i wanted to do and im thankful to him spitz for doing what he did

5125046 everybody is doing work in their own way but we want take that further to the grassroot level and do things in a different manner
5125047 under the single security handling agency instructions air india was authorized to screen the registered baggage at mumbai airport it has been observed that jet airways is screening the registered baggage themselves
5125048 the airline is working with bcas on the issue as it has done in the past to ensure that passengers are not unduly inconvenienced while ensuring that security requirements both indian and international are not compromised
5125049 in indian airports passengers themselves get their check in bag x rayed taped and stamped by the airports security agency which is air india in the case of mumbai the passenger then goes to the check in desk and hands over the screened bag which is then sent to the aircraft concerned by the carrier
5125050 so it wanted jet airways to put the bags through a secondary screening after a passenger handed them over at check in
5125051 to comply with tsas requirements jet airways installed its own x ray machines but it put these up in front of the counters and did away with the first primary screening which is done by air india the decision brought savings as the airline would have had to pay air india about rs 18 000 per flight for a wide bodied aircraft and rs 16 000 per flight for a narrow bodied plane jet airways must have saved more than a million dollars over the last year air india did not object to this arrangement
5125052 the bcas had appointed air india as the single security handling agency for mumbai airport so the onus of ensuring compliance of its orders by all airlines lies with bcas and aai mial
5125053 though there was some cost benefit it is not the motivational factor for initiating the change security is
5125054 level of security achieved was therefore higher than the level of security that prevailed when passengers collected their screened bags and tendered it to the check in desk
5125055 as practised by the aviation security industry and in consultation with the bcas we proceeded with screening checked bags downstream after acceptance of the baggage from passengers this minimises inconveniences to passengers and enhances security
5125056 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5125057 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave
5125058 have to call an extraordinary meeting of the council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5125059 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
5125060 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia

5125112 the government has squandered an opportunity to deal with cumulative impacts that were understood eight to ten years ago
5125113 the message that was coming from the alberta cabinet in particular was rapid development
5125114 a lot of work has been done to explore different options and gather scientific input
5125115 there s really nothing stopping the government from doing that
5125116 the associated press document provides additional evidence suggesting the obama campaigns insistence that obama was never trained in islam and he never lived as a muslim is not accurate
5125117 moreover the document indicated that obama may have been an indonesian citizen when he lived there
5125118 this is an issue the obama rebuttal fails to address at all evidently conceding the accuracy of the claim
5125119 the obama rebuttal misses the point in claiming my statements about the school registration are a lie
5125120 it is clearly true that the an american expat in southeast asia blog did state the registration listed obama as an indonesian citizen and a muslim that is not a lie
5125121 now that we have the ap photo we see the blog was correct in describing the registration
5125122 the most convincing evidence obama was living in indonesia as a muslim not simply registered as muslim because his father was muslim comes from obamas experience at the government run public school at sdn 1 menteng jakarta not from his time at the catholic assisi school in jakarta
5125123 to put it quite simply mengaji classes are not something that a non practicing or so called moderate muslim family would ever send their child to
5125124 the obama campaign desperately wants to deny obama was raised as a muslim child in the four years he lived in indonesia from age 6 to 10

5125374 just what its like to live in poverty and how we juggle things
5125375 the main point i want to make is that our government is not run constitutionally anymore
5125376 our management is being held hostage by our tech team
5125377 once upon a time in a land far away filled with chocolate monsters and mediocrity there lived a beautiful princess named crazy one day crazy was dancing thru the dirty crime riddled meadow and she came upon a sad creature named pudding pudding and crazy talked for a bit and soon grew quite fond of one another the beautiful princess learned that the evil lord had placed a curse on pudding crazy hoped and hoped that there was a way to lift this terrible curse but had to accept that only pudding could do this the next day pudding set off to battle to hopefully end this terrible curse once and for all so that he and crazy can live happily ever after
5125378 will you pledge that by january 2013 the end of your first term more than five years from now there will be no u s troops in iraq
5125379 its hard to project four years from now and i think it would be irresponsible we dont know what contingency will be out there
5125380 i agree with barack it is very difficult to know what were going to be inheriting you know we do not know walking into the white house in january 2009 what were going to find
5125381 would you pledge to the american people that iran will not develop a nuclear bomb while you are president
5125382 i intend to do everything i can to prevent iran from developing a nuclear bomb
5125383 would you pledge to the american people that iran would not build a nuclear bomb on your watch
5125384 well senator i want to ask you this because in 2004 when you ran for president you said we could not afford universal health care it was not achievable and it was not responsible youve changed dramatically on this issue
5125385 if israel concluded that irans nuclear capability threatened israels security would israel be justified in launching an attack on iran
5125386 governor if kitty dukakis were raped and murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer
5125387 were going to take a break and come back with our lightning round 30 seconds to answer each question
5125388 the united states should use military force to stop the genocide in darfur
5125389 i mean one of the jobs of a president is being very reasoned in approaching these issues and i dont think its useful to be talking in these kind of abstract hypothetical terms
5125390 to the extent that they have relatively small differences over health care policies if either one becomes president those would all be subsumed
5125391 and as to whether originally they were for war in iraq that difference had been debated
5125392 which was more electable in november that was the heart of the issue
5125393 music makes the body move and words touch our soul
5125394 we will be a friend on the voyage of discovery through the inner universe in our inner cinema sometimes happy sometimes a little sad but never hopeless this is the way it has to be
5125395 i am a fan of movies i love making them writing them watching them i am an actor have been since i was 5 years old
5125396 youre the only singer ive seen who sounds better than his cd
5125397 his revolutionary writing style and lifestyle goes hand in hand he works out 4 times a week and does not drink or smoke juice is a true artist and plays trumpet like his life depends on it his attitude his love for the game clearly set him well above many new artists on the circuits rob truly has the juice
5125398 for me music at its very best is an internal journey that is both healing and transforming
5125399 everybody did a super job and as the crew chiefs and the drivers and the engineers commiserated on all the programs made their adjustments toward the end of the day they were able to salvage the situation so that everybody was in the top 10 and certainly except for kyle busch being up there we had a chance to have two or three winners or actually four winners out of the top five
5125400 bob osborne crew chief just did a great job everybody the crew did an unbelievable job and the greatest part is that we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5125401 hes just so strong and every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us so thats what we just have to keep doing is going out here and try to win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground but the guys are doing great bob made great adjustments and thats the key to the race
5125402 four years ago today i ran my first cup race for jack roush and he took a giant gamble on me i felt like at the time to put me in that car
5125403 jack won the race that day i believe greg biffle won it and we finished 10th all five of the cars were in the top 10 and to be a part of that again today for ford motor co for roush and for all the guys its an honor
5125404 cheating the bad things good nascar nextel cup racers do in pursuit of speed
5125405 our overall strategy has been and continues to be to strengthen our position in the affinity based segment of the subscription driven dating market
5125406 our focus on affinity markets as well as the improved infrastructure and efficiencies we have put into place over the past year continue to bear fruit
5125407 despite a reduction in revenue driven by continued declines in the general market segment adjusted ebitda 1 excluding gains from a currency translation adjustment and the reversal of accrued credit card fines from a prior period reached 4 0 million or a 26 margin in addition contribution margin reached 73 a three percentage point increase over the prior quarter and our second best over the past 13 quarters
5125408 jdate com grew for the third straight quarter following last years price increase and we continued jdates international expansion with the launch of jdate co uk for the united kingdom in addition we accelerated our ad sales initiative increasing advertising revenue 30 over the prior quarter
5125409 our strategic and operating priorities for the next few quarters are to fuel jdates growth through new product enhancements and further global expansion examine additional marketing strategies to grow other affinity networks manage the general market segment to attractive margins and cash flow and leverage the increasing traction of our advertising offering to increase the contribution of ad sales to our total revenue
5125410 its in our criminal justice system that everyone is innocent until theyre proven guilty but in all reality until you actually are proven your innocence you carry the scarlet letter of the accused
5125411 i think the main ingredient was no surprises and careful planning
5125412 we were able to complete a major tie in leading into the new i 90 bridge
5125413 they learned what techniques worked best and they readjusted this weekend
5125414 they were able to move quickly and complete the project early

5125420 michael has an ankle injury and it has swollen up very badly and hell be out for maybe two or three weeks which is unfortunate
5125421 ryans got a hamstring injury so it was disappointing to get these injuries on top of what were missing anyway i havent got too many complaints we did our best with the resources we had available
5125422 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask
5125423 im not discussing anyone i think we have a good squad the same squad as last year and when tevez comes back and wayne gets games that will be my strike force
5125424 thats what it was last season and im happy to continue with that there are 37 games left so it is not a disaster we have shown before we can come from behind
5125425 in spite what everyone thinks were working really hard to bring quality players in
5125426 i think too often in the last few years newcastle have bought players that havent been quite good enough for whatever reason
5125427 sometimes they havent settled sometimes they havent seemed to understand what it means to play for newcastle united
5125428 the three that weve got so far do and the next three must as well and if that means waiting then so be it
5125429 anyone can collect players because there are hundreds around but good players who can play at newcastle not everyone can do that

5125432 to play in the austrian city of salzburg the homeland of mozart is great honour for a musician of any country this year over a dozen russians are taking part in the salzburg festival they include several brilliant singers with contracts at the worlds best theatres take for instance yekaterina syurina a singer of the moscow novaya opera theatre almost all of the critics say that she is a most beautiful woman with a voice that is just amazing there is also marina poplavskaya a winner of the maria callas competition in athens and an invited soloist of the moscow bolshoi theatre and the london royal opera

5125447 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5125448 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5125449 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5125450 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5125451 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5125452 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community
5125453 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
5125454 i told my staff we dont have to answer this stuff
5125455 its the law of the land if you dont want to go be prepared to go to jail
5125456 judging by the results i dont know what he was afraid of
5125457 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
5125458 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
5125459 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
5125460 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5125461 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
5125462 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
5125463 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
5125464 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to
5125465 we are very excited to be introducing changes in the next few months which will see significant improvements in our services to members
5125466 big splash has already displayed a good grasp of the issues we face across the media spectrum we have a website a daily online communication to the trade with available travel product a magazine and a year book all of which have been with separate publishers until now big splash media will bring them under one umbrella for the benefit of afta its members and advertisers
5125467 afta is a terrific organisation to be working with and i am excited to be involved
5125468 they intuitively know that in 2008 organisations like afta need to be able to connect with members and spread the word about travel and the industry
5125469 working with a trusted brand like afta which has a long history of more than 50 years is a rare opportunity and big splash looks forward to sharing in the next phase of the afta legacy
5125470 this is a fascinating time for travel agents some people see web sites taking over but web sites and travel agents provide the perfect complementary service for the travelling public one is all about great service and knowledge and other is about price and availability

5125479 this years art theme is about nationality identity and the nature of patriotism one species of the patriotic urge conflates the nation state with mass identity governments as actors on a worldwide stage become a surrogate for self a vast projection of collective ego and yet there is another type of patriotic feeling that attaches us to place and people to a home and its culture both these feeling states and their attendant ironies are relevant to this years theme

5125483 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
5125484 i think that from a progress standpoint its probably gone a little bit slower than what we would have expected you cant control these strikes and so on
5125485 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
5125486 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
5125487 while i was shopping just across the street i heard a huge explosion
5125488 body parts were flying through the air i immediately realised that farooqs party was targeted and he was probably dead
5125489 i rushed to the scene of the explosion to see terrified people running everywhere and women calling for their missing children
5125490 the situation was chaotic and horrible i saw dead bodies wounded people and blood stains on the ground later ambulances arrived and picked both the wounded and the dead he said
5125491 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5125492 if ive seen that symbol before i know where its coming from
5125493 trust me when i tell you there is never a dull moment
5125494 its your eyes and your hands are the tools of the trade for this
5125495 we probably do the fastest bathroom runs youve ever seen
5125496 i never heard brakes squeal so loud in all my life
5125497 i still havent had a chance to read the full decision yet
5125498 i know that we won the appeal and that the town has to pay the shortfall for our pension
5125499 it will benefit individuals that are nearing retirement for sure theres no doubt about that
5125500 obviously it ensures that we will have a profitable pension for years to come
5125501 at this point were still referring with our legal advisors and exploring what are options are going to be
5125502 the main focus was to get a demonstration to nova scotia farmers
5125503 we see a lot of opportunity with the land thats available
5125504 i think it will be interesting to see how they turn out
5125505 wed have to start construction of the plant this fall
5125506 our concept is to build a number of these across north america
5125507 me and matt kemp were out there looking at each other when they tied it up saying what the hecks going on its a big emotional swing but youve got to jump right back on it and stay mentally tough in that situation
5125508 weve had to come up big in some situations and when they present themselves dont back down go up there tough it out really grind out that at bat and make the most of it
5125509 were certainly in a good place right now with a lot of confidence
5125510 we expect to win when we come out here i mean its that intensity without being tense which is where you really want to be i like that type of attitude that we have right now
5125511 that was a gut wrencher there when you lose that kind of lead in the ninth inning especially with two out
5125512 and then to be able to come back and win the game what can i cay i mean it goes from tragic to magical
5125513 he didnt just pick me up he picked the whole team up
5125514 but we cant even think that far ahead right now
5125515 i am happy that a player that has made basketball history would come to montegranaro
5125516 and he has been staying in shape to show up at our camp in good shape
5125517 obviously the houston rockets are not far off from competing for a championship
5125518 the possibilities are endless to be able to win a championship
5125519 it obviously puts us a step closer to our ultimate goal which is winning a championship
5125520 this is something we all dream about as kids and to have it actually happen is amazing
5125521 i was thinking this might be the year i broke through and got a win but at six shots back i didnt think much about it
5125522 i just tried to play the best i could i honestly didnt expect to win at all but thats how golf goes its four rounds 72 holes and anything can happen
5125523 its happened to me and whoever in golf there are no guarantees youre leading by seven strokes five strokes it doesnt matter she played well and i know she was expecting a great situation but shes 19 years old this will probably be a great experience for her
5125524 it probably will be overshadowed by the olympics especially with the aussies doing so well in swimming
5125525 but its great sport is such a huge part of our culture i hope it gets coverage down there because we need to raise the profile of womens golf participation has actually been declining in the last five years the more aussies that do well the better the game is going to get
5125526 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5125527 being pain free in the later part of the year i started feeling confident from may on its getting better and better and now in the offseason i know what to work on for next year
5125528 playing with all these great golfers out here and competing with those great golfers i think is going to make me develop my game and give me lots of confidence when i get ready for the u
5125529 i think its a good opportunity to play in this
5125530 i didnt even think about playing this well he added
5125531 all i was trying to do was not make any mistakes
5125532 the more you play it the more you find out about the course where not to miss it especially said clemsons phillip mollica who won the north and south amateur last year at no
5125533 its going to be more about hitting fairways getting the ball in play off the tee versus a couple of years ago when the rough was down and you could really hit it anywhere out there its going to be a premium hitting fairways
5125534 the bad thing is i couldnt play a practice round at pinehurst so ill have to just use my caddie for playing those courses lee said
5125535 yeah i can drive em man theyre just hard to drive like that all day he said laughing
5125536 i ran fifth all day and maybe better than that at some parts of the race and im a good enough driver i should have finished somewhere around there with that car
5125537 we show up fast but we cant put a whole race together so weve got to do some homework weve got to science it out and figure out what the heck is going on because we are sure fast when that race starts
5125538 originally i thought that i ran right into jimmie gordon said
5125539 my spotter didnt say anything until the last second he said two cars on the outside instead of three wide ultimately were responsible
5125540 our pit stops have been just terrible today he said
5125541 we finally got an awesome race car and we just didnt have the total package today its very disappointing its kind of been the way our seasons gone we get the pit stops awesome and we cant get the car right what are you going to do
5125542 im relieved because weve been going in every week going well we cant take too big of a risk but we got to push hard enough
5125543 loose then tight loose then tight we were struggling all afternoon hamlin said
5125544 we had some really good pit stops and had the fedex office toyota running in the top 10 before it all came apart everyone on the team is working really hard we just need consistency
5125545 we are falling behind getting into the chase and need to be more consistent we just cant seem to get there every week its something at this point we dont deserve to be in the chase
5125546 ill be glad to talk to you about the fourth car next week at bristol
5125547 david is certainly in the mix but theres a lot of balls still in the air right now czarnecki said
5125548 we hope to have something done in the next week or two but nothings set yet
5125549 hell run some cup races this year whether or not hes running the full thing next year or not gibbs said
5125550 which ones were going to run with him were still in the process of laying out how that works
5125551 were just trying to figure out when can we gear up and do that ourselves internally gibbs said
5125552 we were going down the second fairway and my caddie mark long said lets say you are four behind funk said
5125553 we were trying to make it as if we were behind all day dont protect anything and fire at all the flags
5125554 he wasnt going to be denied today said haas who shot a 72 to tie for third with tom watson 70
5125555 he got to 6 up after 15 and i just took my foot off the gas
5125556 in my mind i just wanted to get up as far as i could and basically bury the field funk said
5125557 when i got to 6 under for the day i as doing exactly what i wanted to do
5125558 elgin was so far ahead of his time it was unbelievable
5125559 it was impossible to guard elgin he didnt get up that high but he stayed up longer than you did
5125560 if you both jump together and you both go up 30 inches youll both come down together one guy cant stay up any longer
5125561 we have come a long way from the situation existing just two years ago when nsw was regarded as underperforming and under resourced by the tourism industry around the country
5125562 we particularly welcome the new and extensive arrangements for industry consultation and cooperation todays announcement is the culmination of a lot of blood sweat and tears and an unprecedented level of industry cooperation
5125563 the nsw tourism industry council is proud of the role we have played in both coordinating the industry and putting our views forcefully and patiently to government
5125564 i still love him and i think he loves me
5125565 i still see him all the time at least once a week
5125566 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
5125567 called jamie lynn and told her that she would have to go by herself she was irate i think she knew he was staying because of me
5125568 around the same time jamie lynn publicly announced that she was pregnant he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
5125569 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this we would hang out and hook up have sex
5125570 when i see jamie lynn talking about how happy she is with casey it seems so fake

5125686 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it

5125701 he had a serious knee injury and it becomes a confidence thing whether youre ever going to be able to use that leg right and get your legs underneath you to hit
5125702 its been a long process but he can hit the young man can hit hes having a good year for us and we need it and when he starts using the whole field like he did today hes just going to get better
5125703 hes getting there when you blow your knee out as bad as he did it takes a while i think confidencewise hes starting to feel like he can really be a power guy and all those things we know he can hit so we just keep letting him out there
5125704 i think the one thing is that he gets a little pull conscious every once in a while and today he used the whole field thats the type of hitter he really can be the whole field
5125705 its still broken its only nine days out from breaking it so theres not that much that we can expect from it right now theyll probably re x ray here in about a week or so and see if its been healed and healing and go from there

5125773 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5125774 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5125797 its like winter asked me to hold its coat punched me in the stomach then ditched me at an bad acid party thrown by charlie browns teacher
5125798 captives are a risk management tool and not really an insurance mechanism
5125799 even though when captives are formed to look after hazardous risks then they are a form of self insurance
5125800 when you work on the balance sheet you take your income and expenditure and then on the balance you work on the net profit before tax but if you increase your outgo and reduce income the profit goes down and you pay lesser taxes to do just that major corporations form their own captive insurance companies and register them mostly in a little island called bermuda
5125801 today there are over 4 500 captives worldwide writing over 38 billion in premiums
5125802 some of the worlds leading firms such as bp microsoft proctor amp gamble and british airways have utilized captive insurance structures captives are especially popular in sectors such as energy industry property and construction financial services transportation utilities healthcare
5125803 whilst the total premiums paid to captives in respect of property and casualty insurance are difficult to accurately identify
5125804 it is estimated that they are in the region of 55 to 60 billion reflecting approximately 20 percent of the estimated corporate spend on such insurance
5125805 here there is no need for a captive because they are not paying any taxes
5125806 so the very basis for having a captive doesnt exist but it does exist for places such as iran and india and for that dubai is best placed
5125807 the region has one locally based captive managed by an independent captive manager in bahrain and a few captives based in global off shore domiciles
5125808 now with the first registered captive manager in the difc the regional market will start to have the needed expertise to develop and expand
5125809 with a multitude of inquiries coming from all around the region the difc is set to be the stage for the boom of the industry
5125810 in order for captive insurance companies to operate efficiently we need to have service providers around the captive industry such as auditors law firms actuaries etcetera which can all be readily found in dubai
5125811 in such a file lawyers open a captive account and pay premium to the captive once you pay the premium it shows as an expense but they dont recover the claim from the captive immediately and let it pile up such amounts are claimed only when there are other losses to offset
5125812 so they form captives of their own called association captives
5125813 captives work better when you have risks where you can predict what the loss ratio is going to be
5125814 so rather than money transfer between an insurer and a client you put it into a captive liability insurance is not like that it has sudden spikes and captives cannot take those spikes because those spikes knock you out
5125815 around 15 to 20 percent of the revenues in america go to captives and it would certainly show up on mainstream insurance providers
5125816 captive insurance firms have existed since the 1920s and their role is to complement and support the market and not to compete with it

5125824 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5125825 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5125826 typical wednesday hump day is no fun for most of us with work being spread out during the weekends from on call status freelance and projects hump days are just ridiculous we decided to move the middle of our week to thursday
5125827 our collective kids now outnumber the band more than 2 to 1
5125828 we set out to make a record that would be entertaining for them not strictly a childrens record but a record that children would really enjoy our kids are in to all kinds of music they love the they might be giants kids records but they also love the beatles fountains of wayne randy newman black eyed peas and green day making the focus about what our kids like was a truly liberating process and fun for the whole band

5125835 all three schools will be inspected today thats my understanding
5125836 i imagined someone telling an autistic people to look them in the eye i was already aware that its difficult
5125837 the image i had was a book about truth and integrity with looking someone in the eye traditionally being a visual clue of honesty
5125838 desert island all time top five most memorable breakups in chronological order
5125839 i get by because people make a special effort to shop here
5125840 mostly young men who spend all their time looking for deleted smiths singles and original not re released underlined frank zappa albums
5125841 people would come up and say this book is about me literally this book is about me ive been told i dont know how many times i know the record shop you wrote about and the shops in some part of the country ive never been to its a fairly depressing indictment of the state of things i think
5125842 that many young men can identify with robs inner monologue which is spoken through great incisive writing its a very funny book but he also captured this particular type of character with brutal honesty and its actually kind of strangely romantic in a way so i felt the combination of all those things was really remarkable
5125843 wed go through the book and structure it out and then steve and d v would go off and write and then id read what they do and then sometimes id go off and id write for a while and theyd read it finally when we were getting it all together wed sit with two or three different computers and say all right well heres a checklist of things we need to get done so each person would then check something off the list and take a pass at it and then three of us would edit it together
5125844 i liked the idea of it being in america it had a sort of this sort of more optimistic way in which americans live seemed to me to add something to it rather than taking it away so it lost some of its stoicism and became slightly more romantic
5125845 the film has 70 song cues and we probably listened to 2 000 songs to get those 70 cues we used our rob and dick and barry dispositions a lot
5125846 he kind of just laughed at the idea and said send me a script so when we finished shooting we wrapped around 2 a m flew to new york and taped him in his studio for an hour the next morning
5125847 even more sharply than the book the movie evokes the turmoil of urban single life with a quirky mixture of confessional poignancy and dry self deflating humor
5125848 i never expected it to be so faithful at times it appears to be a film in which john cusack reads my book
5125849 i would like that phone me pointing at phone but i dont want to pay the price youd like me to pay so i tell you what if you wave my service upgrade and bring down the price ill buy the phone from you today

5125853 take this back i dont want anything this is disgusting
5125854 the truth is that were not staring down the barrel of a nuclear confrontation with the russians as we did from time to time with the soviets the likelihood of a military confrontation i think is very small
5125855 there are a lot of possible actions that the west could take
5125856 as i say the integration into many of these western institutions has been premised on certain kinds of behaviour by russia and well just have to work with our allies and i think how russia behaves from here forward also has an influence on the nature of those consequences
5125857 theres a broad menu of possibilities and i dont think theres much benefit in getting into the specifics
5125858 on july 6 2008 chinese public security bureau psb officials evicted pastor bike zhang chairman of the federation house church and his wife xie fenglan from their home in chaoyang district beijing
5125859 the couple was able to find shelter in the home of a friend niu bei until officials found them and forced the zhangs to leave zhang and his wife moved into a hotel in guo xian town tongzhou district on july 14 tongzhou district psb officials threatened the owner of the hotel to evict the couple or face incarceration the couple then decided to find residence in changping county but were stopped by police officials while on their way and taken to the town government office
5125860 police interrogated the couple withholding food drink or rest xie fenglan collapsed due to the stress of the torture the couple was later released from the government office
5125861 zhang and his wife are now forced to live on the streets and are not able to find shelter

5125870 i am not speaking for my party i am speaking for myself as an individual i do support anwar ibrahim in this by election i am not actually supporting him too much as an individual but more on the movement that he leads
5125871 i feel if anwar is elected to parliament the voices of the opposition will be stronger and the chances of strengthening the democracy and widening the democratic space will be better for these reason i support him
5125872 a lot of memories a lot of history made there

5125879 in the next few months senator mccain has got to focus on those issues in order to recapture part of the political middle that has been drifting away from republicans in recent elections
5125880 i think our generation has a hard time identifying with either political party

5125887 after a thorough search that entailed interviewing several outstanding candidates i concluded that allison offers us a proven record at improving fundraising communications and building the grassroots
5125888 the strongest team of leaders and staff rpv has ever seen
5125889 i wanted an executive director who was not a top down leader but understood the importance of physically meeting with grassroots republicans and contributors from lee county to the eastern shore and find out what tools they needed to win in their areas
5125890 allison worked tirelessly to revitalize the republican party in new york state at a local level and her work contributed to our stunning victories in 2007
5125891 the virginia gop has made a great choice in hiring allison as executive director allison and i worked very closely in pennsylvania during 2006 one of the most difficult years in decades for republicans as the political director despite overwhelming odds she was able to guide our victory program to second in the nation together we worked closely with the state legislature to pass a voter id bill that was signed by a democrat governor allison will prove to be a great asset in a state we must carry in november to elect sen john mccain the next president of the united states
5125892 i wanted to do a relatable grounded character comedy about marriage and the lengths we go to preserve the spark

5125938 november 11 2003 by kenneth kirschner i believe he always titles his tracks after the date they were started recorded on an old piano with no electronic manipulation
5125939 09 15 2004 i assume those are the days that deupree made the tracks as a side note kirschner also gave the source material to everyone in the world it was put out under a creative commons license and a
5125940 08 09 2004 is centered around a long drone that gradually changes its tone quality over the length of the track i wouldnt be surprised if deupree used the same techniques here as he did on his now classic
5125941 09 15 2004 is more conventional in its style actually it sounds quite similar to what fennesz did with sakamoto on
5125942 in a state of simple awareness the most evolutionary choices come to you spontaneously while the ego agonizes over every detail of a situation a deeper part of your awareness knows what to do already and its choices emerge with amazing finesse and perfect timing
5125943 the most direct and consistent way that i know to bring peace into every aspect of your individuality is through the regular practice of meditation take time on a daily basis to quiet your mind and calm your body this helps you take peace beyond a mood you are trying to maintain to your essential state of being
5125944 the deepest hunger in life is a secret that is revealed only when a person is willing to unlock a hidden part of the self in ancient traditions of wisdom this quest has been likened to diving for the most precious pearl in existence a poetic way of saying that you have to swim far out beyond shallow waters plunge deep into yourself and search patiently until the pearl beyond price is found
5125945 when you are living your dharma you do not think about what youd rather be doing time loses its grip as you become absorbed in the present moment you are doing exactly what you find most nourishing and at the same time providing value to everyone affected by your actions
5125946 the worlds sea of interrelatedness collapses into individual waves that scatter into foaming drops that sparkle like diamonds reflecting one another for a moment only to subside back into the oceans depths there is only one eternal moment an eternal love spirit or consciousness that constantly becomes seer and scenery we are those crystalline drops each of us beautiful and unique for a moment each a part of the other each reflecting the other
5125947 everything in life is about attention and intention we bring our awareness to something a person a sound a sensation an experience and then we paint it with a specific intention or perspective when we meditate we open ourselves to an increasing number of perspectives which then gifts us increasing possibilities in the world around us
5125948 you are the luminous mystery in which the entire universe with its forms and phenomena arises and subsides when this realization dawns there is a complete transformation of your personal self into your universal self the complete loss of all fear including death you have become a being who radiates love the same way the sun radiates light you have finally arrived at the place from which your journey began
5125949 the best way to evaluate whether we are moving in the direction of greater well being is by listening to out inner messages of comfort or distress our highest evolutionary path is the one that generates the least resistance and the greatest joy
5125950 the true purpose of yoga is to discover that aspect of your being that can never be lost your job may change your relationships may change your body may change your beliefs may change your desires may change but the essence of who you are is the continuity of awareness that has no beginning or end
5125951 the love you seek is seeking you at this moment your longing your deep fantasies about being loved are mere shadows of the melting sweetness that makes spirit want to love you be honest about your seeking and be alert to the moments when love is showing itself to you the messages of love may not be clear to anyone else around you even those most intimate to you that doesnt matter they are meant for you and you alone

5125964 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5125965 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5125966 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5125967 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5125968 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5125991 we often hear that mold is everywhere and that gives people the impression that its okay to have mold and you cant prevent it and nothing could be further from the truth
5125992 there may be areas so humid that its more difficult to control growth but in most of the country mold is not growing everywhere there are definitely spores in the air but thats not the same thing as mold growth a very very important distinction to make the same can be said about dust mites mold growth and dust mites can be controlled its pretty straightforward
5125993 the irony is that youre told to put in air conditioning for asthma and allergy problems and in one way its helpful but in another way it can be detrimental
5125994 an air conditioning coil and everything around it is damp while the machine is running so unless the surfaces are absolutely 100 percent clean mold is going to grow its almost inevitable that if somebody has an air conditioning system or a portable air conditioner and they dont use adequate filtration theyre going to get mold so the single most important thing for all air conditioning is to use a decent filter
5125995 dust is the devil youve got to get rid of all the dust
5125996 people with allergies or asthma should not use a vacuum that doesnt have a bag because when you dump that accumulated dust out you just create clouds of it all over again its basically negating the whole job

5126047 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5126048 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

5126056 there is a difference between letting the expert brand managers and guardians do their job and generate the buy in they require and undermining the whole process by you soliciting and then immediately acting upon unregulated opinion on every issue you are derailing and sabotaging the entire brand management process
5126057 brands and marketing need to be guided by brand and non brand workers and outside opinions from customers and not just the ideas and views of a few top level executives in the marketing department
5126058 where i come from in asia everyone must have a say especially those selling the product sales and now with the power of the internet our seo search engine optimizer must have a final say in any decision

5126083 paul temporal shows how the fundamental principles of brand building are transferable to the asian environment a diverse collection of asian caselets should convince us that the 21st century will see the emergence of more asian regional and global megabrands
5126084 branding in asia addresses an unusual situation in asia how is it that a region which has such high brand appreciation produces few international brands of its own the authors analysis of actual case studies ranging from powerful global brands to local companies illustrates his points clearly this coupled with a sensitive understanding of the cultural differences in the region makes it an excellent reference for everyone working with brands
5126085 paul temporal succinctly dissects the often mystical qualities that make up a successful brand too often western insights models and case studies are applied arbitrarily across the globe it is so refreshing to see branding tackled from a purely asian perspective an invaluable reference book and eminently readable the step by step style and volume of relevant cases and examples makes this a must have for any manager in asia looking to embark on creating his own regional or global brand

5126161 for starters it is clear that the total rebounding stats of teams like los angeles and denver are a fa ade resulting from their faster pace and number of total possessions which artificially inflate their total number of rebounds but do nothing to suggest they rebound at a higher rate further teams like boston and san antonio 23rd to 12th make such dramatic jumps as a result of their rebounding efficiency their slower pace and effective defenses mean that there are fewer total rebounds to be had during their games but they are highly effective at collecting those few boards that are available meaning they have an even larger proportion of the harder to come by possessions in their slower games one need only think back to the finals and then look at the effect this stat has specifically on boston and los angeles to understand its ramifications

5126163 it was a mostly overlooked moment in a mostly overlooked season as the heat prepared for 2007 08 pat riley decided he had one definitive leader so udonis haslem was named the heats lone captain in fact in his first five seasons dwyane wade has never been a heat captain never if a return to health by wade is paramount to the heats recovery from the nbas worst record an ascent to a leadership position is nearly as vital thats what made wades performance in thursdays 92 69 olympic victory over greece so heartening wade not only made his mark in the box score but also with his determination be it seizing the defensive challenges be it the relentless hustle that led to dazzling first half assists to kobe bryant and dwight howard with shaquille oneal gone there is no doubt this time about who is the heats star now there has to be no issue about who is the teams leader
5126164 the injury risk is probably overstated although the broken foot pau gasol suffered playing for spain at the 2006 world championships unquestionably changed the direction of the memphis grizzlies as a franchise but i dont think you can discount the effects of spending so much time so far away from home in an already short nba summer even if the americans are staying at five star hotels and having their meals cooked by a private chef once williams and boozer return home theyll have only 35 days to turn around and get ready for the start of training camp its a given that theyll sit out practices during two a days and play fewer minutes in the preseason because of their summer schedule
5126165 sometimes gms will give players big contracts to scare away all other suitors like the nuggets did with nene and the warriors did with andris biedrins this summer but with this strategy you risk overpaying your player to the point that you cripple your salary cap flexibility and with the nuggets in a cost cutting mode they clearly dont want to throw a lot of money at smith unless theyre forced to match someone elses offer the better strategy and its the one being deployed by the kroenke cronies right now is to publicly announce that you will match any offer thrown at your player this combined with smiths history of off court problems seems to have scared other teams away from offering smith a sizable contract

5126172 wade quite frankly looks happier in beijing than he has looked on any basketball court in a very long time his own physical problems and the heats demise of course have had more than a little something to do with wades ennui and its almost certainly a load more fun for wade to be playing with james and bryant and his other olympic headliner pals than it was when he was trying to muddle along with the heat and wilting in the suffocating presence of pouty shaquille oneal in miami the past couple of years it shows so does something else there have been reports that wade is enthusiastic about re discovered strength in his legs and he is obviously quicker in the open court and more powerful into his jumps hes oozing confidence

5126205 people were not coming downtown we had to do something now were seeing the results
5126206 im saying its a lie because everyone knows its a lie
5126207 the border patrol is doing it as part of their job they didnt notify the city of any additional activity they didnt notify the police department of any additional activity
5126208 but if federal laws are being broken the city is supportive of those laws being enforced

5126216 in saying that as a person of faith obama believes that things will work out and that we will get the president we need he may be picking up on the sovereignty of god whose ways are perfect but one hopes he understands that god in his sovereignty can visit catastrophe on a wayward people if we are spiritually unwise in our choice of leaders we may well get a spanking we need
5126217 mccain answers questions by telling stories obama answers like an academic i think people like storytellers better than professors they will like mccains simple yes and no responses obama tries to show he would be a good leader by recognizing nuance and complexity mccain tries to show he would be a good leader by being decisive
5126218 to grant that abortion is a moral issue but to duck when human life begins is at best inconsistent one would think it is vital no pun intended to think though exactly that question obamas unguarded line about not punishing a daughter of his with a child really hurt him in the pro life movement
5126219 obama has correctly refocused the abortion question on how women experience pregnancy and abortion for far too long the discussion has focused solely on fetuses as if they exist somehow independent of the women in whose bodies they reside
5126220 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5126221 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5126222 obama will be hammered by the religious right for that pay grade answer
5126223 specious obama has made that very determination in opening the law wide to the killing of the unborn
5126224 specifically says that neither biologists nor doctors nor theologians can agree upon the moral status of the fetus
5126225 absolute certainty that the woman herself does have moral status then the conservative thing to do is to protect the womans interests first

5126227 if he believes in human rights at the moment of conception then he ought to be against embryonic stem cell research ivf and even the so called rhythm method
5126228 which has the effect of timing intercourse not only to prevent conception but also to allow conception at a time when the fertilized egg will drop into a uterus that is not at the right time of month for implantation
5126229 evaded the question of whether he will or will not continue to support embryonic stem cell research as long as the scientists say it is necessary
5126230 odd not to ask it after all if you are going to talk to someone about religion youd be interested to know their thoughts about the central figure in their religion

5126232 personal testimony and scripture citation are both treasured by evangelicals
5126233 mccains knowledge and strong stance for what is just and right he also expressed a sense of humor that i have not seen before
5126234 i commit myself before you and before god almighty to organise free and transparent presidential elections as soon as possible
5126235 i dont think you can control the entire world from one centre
5126236 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
5126237 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus and afghanistan
5126238 iran is definitely having some influence on these issues so we are talking
5126239 theres an immediate need to bring all parties to a common consensus to take the country forward
5126240 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal
5126241 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
5126242 prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
5126243 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
5126244 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them
5126245 before we know it 45 countries will be negotiating with us
5126246 in a sense the u s will act as indias sherpa at the nsg
5126247 the indians will need to convince the nuclear suppliers group that it should give the same kind of international treatment in terms of civil nuclear trade to india that the united states would have just given bilaterally
5126248 without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently

5126251 your volleyball season is about to start and i know you want to learn the secrets of how the pros play like they do strengthen and improve your volleyball skills while playing for your high school and club team now learn early what indoor and beach volleyball olympians and professionals know about 1 the importance of gaining muscle strength for injury prevention gaining speed and increasing your vertical jump while training for volleyball 3 mental conditioning and gaining confidence in yourself and your game on and off the court

5126253 such a decision will be followed by some logistical measures which need to be taken by both countries in order to put the agreement into effect
5126254 the ones we know about have committed criminal offenses in syria
5126255 we inquired about other people and we are still waiting for a response from syrian officials
5126256 later the cabinet will issue a separate decree for an embassy in syria
5126257 then all that remains in front of us are procedural steps which the two foreign ministries will be tasked with taking
5126258 the syrians do not need an embassy to operate in lebanon they have their intelligence as well as their allies
5126259 referring the issue of lebanese prisoners in syrian jails to committees is equivalent to killing it we all know that forming committees will not help in resolving the issue
5126260 demarcating borders in the shebaa farms area will help liberate the occupied territory whereas excluding it aims at creating pretexts for hizbullah to hold on to its arms
5126261 we are not saying that to turn our back to discussing a defense strategy for lebanon but to say that there are other important issues which need to be discussed during national dialogue sessions
5126262 we need to address economic and social issues as well as ways to implement the decisions that were taken during earlier dialogue sessions

5126265 the statement has been given by the gujarat police but nothing of this sort had come out in our probe
5126266 they the us have been issuing statements saying they want fiji to return to democratic rule the us has also increased investment in its military base in guam
5126267 globally the big concern is that the region is not on track to meet its development goals and thats despite economic growth and lots of aid from australia new zealand and the us
5126268 these countries are the highest per capita receivers of aid anywhere in the world but there are still law and order and corruption problems in papua new guinea and the solomon islands the economy is still too reliant on australia and aid it is the fragility of some of these nations that is in question some of them could revert
5126269 we have great potential here for tourism and the forum must also focus on sustainable economies
5126270 we have been advised that one of our aircraft has been involved in an accident and we believe it resulted in fatalities the information we have is that we believe our aircraft was performing a normal approach to coventry airport for landing the collision took place around one minute from touchdown
5126271 they were all our employees that we have known in some cases for many years its a very difficult situation for all of us this is the first serious accident that the group has been involved in for over 20 years we are all extremely shocked at the unexpected tragedy
5126272 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5126273 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50ft up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods

5126303 sa scent naman sila bench people yung nagsabi sa akin na they wanted me to have my own scent so sabi ko why not
5126304 finally after a few months of testing yung mga cologne iba ibang scents and nagpa import pa sila ng oil from france so nakakatuwa
5126305 for the clothing line i gave them my swatches at yung mga design na gusto ko and we thought of the best time para ma launch siya so ito na nga double launch siya
5126306 and im so happy because i just renewed my contract with bench and im really happy that theyre really supportive and mr ben chan is all out sa kung anuman ang gusto ko as an actor as a model and hes also helping me to grow in the retail business

5126325 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced
5126326 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust
5126327 every day we learn something new that completely undercuts corsis credibility

5126339 we are all nintendo warriors today remember that game that electronic game a few years ago push buttons zim zam boom and it was all over with that is not the way you fight war although we as a society have grown to believe that
5126340 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
5126341 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
5126342 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
5126343 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back

5126353 so many people walk around with a meaningless life they seem half asleep even when theyre busy doing things they think are important this is because theyre chasing the wrong things the way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others devote yourself to your community around you and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning
5126354 actually at this time id like to give you my notice if youll accept it

5126383 the idea of trying to utilize the white spaces from a consumer perspective would be a good win for everyone
5126384 i like to think of it as wi fi on steroids
5126385 we have medical devices laptops even toys that are starting to incorporate bluetooth we want the wireless revolution to continue but the little spectrum we have wont get us there
5126386 the only way we operate as a business is if our viewers get a clear tv picture given the fact that theres been a series of failures in testing at the fcc it doesnt give us a lot of comfort
5126387 i would have preferred third but fourth for me is not so bad on tarmac
5126388 weve done some good stage times and set some good splits so if we can increase the consistency its not looking so bad for the tarmac rallies later in season
5126389 i havent had any problems its been a long time since weve had such a clean rally as this
5126390 ive enjoyed myself and the car is getting better grip and traction all the time theres still a long way to go but were moving in the right direction

5126397 the history of the productive apparatus is a history of revolutions
5126398 the opening of new markets foreign or domestic and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as u s steel illustrate the same process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creating a new one
5126399 those revolutions are not strictly incessant they occur in discrete rushes which are separated from each other by spans of comparative quiet the process as a whole works incessantly however in the sense that there is always either revolution or the absorption of revolution both together forming what are known as business cycles
5126400 this process of creative destruction is the essential point about capitalism it is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in
5126401 the essential point to grasp is that in dealing with capitalism we are dealing with an evolutionary process it may seem strange that anyone can fail to see so obvious fact which moreover was long ago emphasized by karl marx capitalism then is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary and this evolutionary character of the capitalist process is not merely due to the fact that economic life goes on in a social and natural environment which changes and by its changes alters the economic data of economic action this fact is important and these changes wars revolutions and so on often condition industrial change but they are not the prime movers nor is this evolutionary character due to quasi automatic increase in population and capital or to the vagaries of monetary systems of which exactly the same thing holds true the fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers goods the new methods of production or transportation the new markets the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates
5126402 in other words the problem that is usually being visualized is how capitalism administers existing structures whereas the relevant problem is how it creates and destroys them as long as this is not recognized the investigator does a meaningless job
5126403 working with heavy industry gave me a profound appreciation of the central dynamic of capitalism creative destruction is an idea that was articulated by the harvard economist joseph schumpeter in 1942 like many powerful ideas his is simple a market economy will incessantly revitalize itself from within by scrapping old and failing businesses and then reallocating resources to newer more productive ones i read schumpeter in my twenties and always thought he was right and ive watched the process at work
5126404 it is capitalism not communism that generates what the communist leon trotsky once called
5126405 it is striking to me that our ideas about the efficacy of market competition have remained essentially unchanged since the eighteenth century enlightenment when they first emerged to a remarkable extent largely from the mind of one man adam smith with the demise of central planning at the end of the twentieth century the forces of capitalism have had free reign prodded by ever expanding globalization still in a sense the history of market competition and the capitalism it represents is the story of the ebb and flow of smiths ideas accordingly the story of his work and its reception repays special attention which addresses the great problem inherent in capitalism that creative destruction is often and by a great many viewed as destruction the history of smiths ideas is the history of attitudes toward the social dislocation capitalism brings and its potential remedies
5126406 unlike marx the fabian socialists of the late nineteenth century were not looking for revolution the group named itself after the ancient roman general fabius who held off hannibals invading army with a military strategy of attrition rather than all out confrontation similarly the fabians aimed not to destroy capitalism but to constrain it the fabians laid the groundwork for modern social democracy and their influence on the world would end up being at least as powerful as that of marx while capitalism succeeded brilliantly in delivering higher and higher standards of living for workers throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it was the tempering effect of fabian socialism that many argued would make market economies politically palatable and keep communism from spreading

5126442 there were like 50 tables only 50 and i was one of the people with a personal invitations you know we watched from a different place
5126443 and we had time to chat with mandela i talked to mandela and i also met some investors i want to invite back to uganda
5126444 michael has been to my house more times than i can recall
5126445 chanel 5 who showed them how to get a real woman who is worth all her salt in the shaker
5126446 easy where u at wanna spend the nyt at yoz what do you say

5126449 men brag that theyd love a woman who cant stop climaxing
5126450 but i struggle to find partners who can keep up with me
5126451 people think having orgasms all the time must be brilliant but they look at me like im some kind of nutter because im always having to stifle my sighs or scurry off for a private moment
5126452 the engine was making the vehicle shake and suddenly i felt an unbearable tingling my back arched and my body jerked sharply as i peaked
5126453 everyone was staring like i was having some kind of fit as i finally yelled out i simply couldnt help myself an old lady asked me what was wrong and i had to pretend id stubbed my toe
5126454 if theres a road with several speed humps then ill be off by the time weve crossed the last one
5126455 i dont drive very often when i pull up just the vibrations are enough to set me off
5126456 that led to my most embarrassing moment when a policeman stopped me for sneaking through traffic lights on amber
5126457 by the time he got to my window i was already pretty flustered he said you know why ive pulled you over dont you
5126458 i was bright red in the face and knew if i opened my mouth id have to moan or cry out as i was actually coming at that stage
5126459 so i just nodded and pretended to have a coughing fit but it was pretty high pitched
5126460 he made me get out of the car and my legs felt really weak because id only just climaxed
5126461 they almost went from under me and he thought i was drunk so he breathalysed me
5126462 but once id composed myself i flirted with him a bit and got away with a ticking off
5126463 i was like most girls at first and didnt always climax
5126464 it didnt really bother me i always enjoyed sex but it wasnt something that ruled my life
5126465 ive never been promiscuous and i used to find lengthy sex sessions that went on for hours a bit boring
5126466 my orgasms were pretty run of the mill then theyd last half a minute or so but between the age of 18 and 20 they got more and more frequent
5126467 occasionally every few months id have multiple orgasms but not all the time now i cant stop im aroused from the moment i wake up
5126468 my boobs are swollen i get this throbbing feeling and im desperate to climax
5126469 when i do it calms me down for a little while but soon afterwards it begins again
5126470 out shopping i can be set off just by the vibration of peoples footsteps
5126471 i cant work in an office because even ringing phones and humming photo copiers do it gardening puts me into spasms every time i bend over and the throb of the lawnmower sparks a climax
5126472 one day i was trying to clear a blocked drain the stench was disgusting but as soon as i started wiggling the rod about to shift the blockage i was crying out in ecstasy
5126473 i dont count how many orgasms i reach a day but it must be around 250 more on a busy day
5126474 sex provides me with just a few moments relief and then the tension builds up again
5126475 one boyfriend even went on an arduous keep fit regime in a bid to keep up with me
5126476 but i still wore him out so badly he ended up in tears and we split its more embarrassing when im with a new partner because often they think im putting on an act and i worry that it scares them off
5126477 usually men think its great at first because they can bring me to orgasm in seconds with any kind of contact
5126478 but im not satisfied and keep on for hours demanding more and more action and then it gets difficult for them and they end up feeling guilty but its not their fault
5126479 ive discovered that slower more gentle love making can leave me a little more satisfied as it takes a bit longer to climax
5126480 even then im talking a couple of minutes at the most
5126481 i drink camomile tea to calm me down and i find a few glasses of wine on a night out can help to deaden the urges a bit
5126482 they know whats happening if i suddenly go red and have to dart off
5126483 did you see coach nutt text messaging yesterday i bet its that new biology teacher
5126484 if mr phelps can handle eight gold medals he can handle anything
5126485 a great savings for a slumping economy you will easily spend 3 to 4 hundred dollars on back to school purchases save yourself 7 dollars on the 100

5126487 you could buy it now and give it at christmas
5126488 i think it was a slider i got enough of it but it doesnt mean much now because we lost the game
5126489 when you lose the lead then win it in the ninth that says a lot of our team it was a big lift for us
5126490 it actually feels good to win one of these majors it feels really good to finish one off
5126491 obviously two weeks at the broadmoor i didnt quite finish one off but it feels really good
5126492 i was on cruise control until i hit 16 and i decided to play super conservative all of a sudden first time all day and it cost me
5126493 it shook me when i made seven there it didnt sit too well with me when i had such a big lead
5126494 it feels good to come in with a major win
5126495 starting off i just wanted to make some birdies i wanted to get in the flow and hopefully make a few birdies
5126496 i did i birdied three and four then bogeyed five i didnt make anything else after that i made the turn and saw what fred was doing and knew i needed to have a good back nine to finish as high as possible
5126497 i saw one of the nz herald sandwich boards outside a dairy on my way to work that said something like
5126498 the state will provide you with someone elses money to spend as you choose whilst interfereing in the lives of other families who for whatever reason do not follow their political agenda
5126499 id love more kids really i just cant afford them
5126500 what about when the childrens father just buggers off and pays nothing the mother has made no choice at all in that situation
5126501 helen clark made some salient points what of solo parents caring for severely disabled children
5126502 cruel hateful illogical exercise in beating up on the poorest worst off
5126503 as for key we have a looming recession increasing cost of living and the first piece of legislation we get any amount of detail on concerns a subject with limited financial impact huge social complexity and in many respects irrelevant to most pressing needs
5126504 there are some family friendly jobs in schools and supermarkets and a few other places but in general the business world is not churning out the kinds of jobs needed to make this work
5126505 id love more kids really i just cant afford them
5126506 lots of parents feel the same the reason they cant afford them is because theyre paying for the offspring of all the philus all over the country as well all labour voters and there are thousands of them taking money shamelessly from working families

5126508 this work demonstrates that we can get a complete genome for a totally unknown organism
5126509 we extracted a complete genome from a very complex community and this is something novel
5126510 you can only use amplification when you know what youre trying to get and thats the problem
5126511 when you want to discover something unknown amplification is a very deficient technique because you keep discovering the things you already know so how can you discover the unknown
5126512 these are the bacteria that maintain the earths health some of the methane escapes in some parts of the lake you can see the bubbles but whatever doesnt escape as bubbles these bacteria do a very good job of eating it

5126516 reports of these machines are authenticated in the courts all over the world and no one can challenge their results
5126517 these machines are of great help and will certainly streamline our working now we are well equipped to face the challenges of burgeoning cyber crime in the vicinity earlier we were dependent on other agencies and laboratories but now we are self sufficient
5126518 overall as a group its an area we can get better at

5126523 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5126524 she met lindsay in the summer of 2006 at a party in malibu from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5126525 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship
5126526 she once said samanthas the father i never had apparently samantha acted in a paternal way towards her giving her advice and cuddles
5126527 courtenay would throw fits of rage writing her hundreds of angry e mails from another room in the house
5126528 the sexual attraction between them was electric though and theyd still kiss and make up
5126529 courtenay still cant understand how lindsay is now so open with samantha every time she sees a picture of them together it kills her
5126530 i think i put a little too much pressure on myself and i found myself trying to overthrow
5126531 i was trying to be very detailed with all of my pitches and i didnt trust my stuff
5126532 i tried really hard but i just let the situation get the best of me
5126533 ive got to put this behind me and move on to the next game
5126534 wolves consume many prey animals a minimum of 150 200 moose contribute to an isle royale wolfs diet over the course of its lifetime and the prey consume a whole lot of plants
5126535 just by being who they are wolves and other top predators increase the sample size because they do the sampling for us
5126536 since the widespread combustion of fossil fuels we have put a human fingerprint on atmospheric carbon dioxide
5126537 that fingerprint shows up in trees and it shows up in animals that eat trees but it shows up with the least variation in the top predators
5126538 its noisy for trees less noisy for moose and even less noisy for wolves
5126539 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5126540 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5126541 sometimes guys just have off years hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5126542 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5126543 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5126544 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5126545 we attempted to do so by the non waiver trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5126546 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5126547 he attacked the hitters i kind of expect the same thing plus hes experienced thats important

5126553 they didnt look like they were going to attack me
5126554 but then i heard one of them say me could kill you mon they rushed toward me and stabbed me here in the neck
5126555 they used a machete to chop my arm then i felt an ice pick go in my back i fell back and my head hit a fire hydrant i was bleeding but no one wanted to help me because they didnt want to touch me

5126560 i can relax and stay as long as i can
5126561 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
5126562 in our post race inspection yesterday was the day we were going to chassis dyno cars our inspectors discovered some shims that were placed on the gas pedal stop
5126563 it was magnets that were about a quarter inch thick that prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open
5126564 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5126565 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5126566 we historically dont make our decisions within a 24 hour period it takes time to get everybody in a group and talk about it
5126567 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5126568 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5126569 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5126570 for us we kind of feel like in the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and chief engine builder mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5126571 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5126572 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5126573 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5126574 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5126575 i found out about it halfway through the day session last night when i went over there to see what was going on
5126576 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing
5126577 but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5126578 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5126579 you look at the no 32 car of brian vickers and red bull racing the 32 and the 18 and the 20 made about the same power the first run on the dyno when they took the magnet or whatever this device was out of the 18 and the 20 they both came up
5126580 what i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on because a lot of whats been done by nascar has been based on the chassis dyno results
5126581 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that

5126662 no way do we fall out of the rankings for losing to a pac 10 power
5126663 the reason pac 10 teams love to play us is because it helps their schedule strength in the computer ratings

5126680 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
5126681 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
5126682 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
5126683 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
5126684 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
5126685 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
5126686 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
5126687 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
5126688 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
5126689 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
5126690 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
5126691 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
5126692 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
5126693 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
5126694 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
5126695 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

5126706 obviously from the race he can go faster than the 9 69 he was having fun in the last 20m celebrating and breaking the world record thats awesome you can read into it he can probably go under 9 60 but i am not good at predictions i just love to see things unfold
5126707 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the line
5126708 hes a phenomenal athlete and i dont think theres any way anyone could have beaten him
5126709 a lot of people are of the belief that you have to be short strong and stocky to be a great sprinter and usain bolt has defied that he has shown that hes a 6ft 5in sprinter and can run well and break world records he has great starts and its the beginning of something else
5126710 i am definitely not going to say hes the epitome of the sprinter because theres too many different kinds of sprinters that ive admired over the years but the way he drives and his pattern the way it goes together his amazing first 40 metres i give it to him
5126711 i woke up around eleven i watched television and then i had some chicken nuggets for lunch i went back to my room i slept for two hours i went back for some more nuggets and came to the track

5126714 nosotros demostramos que se puede clonar una planta adulta lo hemos hecho con un ejemplar de 78 a os esto es muy bueno porque uno puede optar por los mejores ejemplares teniendo en cuenta su historia
5126715 en ello influye tanto la sombra que da a las hojas inferiores y no les permite hacer una buena fotos ntesis como el derroche de agua que hace la planta
5126716 en el plan de gobierno de cristina fern ndez de lula de lugo y de evo morales cuando plantean que los pa ses latinoamericanos deben ser libres y soberanos de la influencia de estados unidos o de europa

5126721 el conflicto del campo nos afect teniendo en cuenta que nuestro rubro es el que primero siente cualquier crisis y es el ltimo que se reactiva hubo ca das desde que empez la crisis hasta inclusive el mes de julio ahora en agosto reci n se est comenzando a ver movimientos
5126722 hemos sufrido una ca da entre un 50 y 60 por ciento en las ventas y en las consultas tambi n bajaron otros tipos de servicios
5126723 hubo un baj n en las compras pero hoy los bancos vuelven a dar los cr ditos con tasas medianamente aceptables y esto favoreci a que se vuelvan a concretar negocios
5126724 en este momento se est reactivando lentamente dado que la gente todav a especula un poco pero creemos que paulatinamente a un ritmo lento pero sostenido van a ir aumentando las consultas y por lo tanto las ventas

5126736 out of order out of time the state of the nations health workforce
5126737 we have had the different parts to the choir but weve never attempted to get them to sing together from the same hymnbook
5126738 its been estimated that by 2020 there will be a shortage of 1 500 physicians in virginia and 22 000 nurses
5126739 out of order out of time the state of the nations health workforce
5126740 with a permanent recovery audit contractor program people with medicare can be assured they are being charged correctly for their share of their health care services
5126741 while afghanistan was under the rule of the taliban they forbade any image of any part of the human body although they allowed some of the medical schools to remain open any text or literature with illustrations was confiscated and burned
5126742 its a great program because it is pretty effortless for the alumni to get involved yet they know they are doing something meaningful by providing the texts to a country in crisis they are thrilled to be a part of this
5126743 after a tour and discussion with chancellor obaidullah obaid we realized a great need for medical textbooks soon after i contacted many different organizations that specialize in donating medical textbooks to developing countries
5126744 by far the greatest response was from operation medical libraries
5126745 i thought they might cry uncle and say they had enough but the need is still great
5126746 there are bases all over both iraq and afghanistan and it is our mission to serve any country that is in conflict
5126747 ti sta bene sei stato cattivo e te lo meriti

5126753 mommies mommies dont be commies stay at home and make pajamis
5126754 what do we want nothing when do we want it now
5126755 and i dont know whether to hold him or beat the living shit out of him and can i possibly beat him while hugging him or would that send mixed messages
5126756 the medicare trigger was cooked up by republicans behind closed doors as a political ploy to foster an unfounded panic about the strength of medicares finances
5126757 we must turn off the trigger and reject republican attempts to arbitrarily limit medicare financing
5126758 this legislative rubber stamp of the entitlement crisis status quo is regrettable irresponsible and unfair to our children and theirs not to mention the seniors who rely on medicare today
5126759 they will bear the consequences of the democratic leaderships refusal to step up and do the right thing
5126760 comprehensive medical liability reforms have a proven track record of success at the state level of reducing health care costs and increasing patient access to quality medical care
5126761 controlling our nations medicare costs is one more reason america needs national medical liability reform
5126762 we are able to track that to make sure the veterans who are referred dont drop through the cracks
5126763 so they say im fine they believe they are tough theyve been normal all their lives and they want to get home
5126764 if you have insomnia and everyone else around you is asleep and you are watching infomercials late at night with anxiety and desperation creeping up on you being able to call someone can be lifesaving
5126765 this is right in line with previous years reports in that it reflects a continued steady improvement and policies that are continuing to become more balanced
5126766 weve seen a number of states where they form initiatives and bring together all the different regulatory groups law enforcement all the boards as well as patient groups and address these issues and look at it broadly
5126767 achieving balance in state pain policy a progress report card

5126770 a doctor would not order some of these tests and participants get the benefit of all of this information while helping everyone in the u s
5126771 we have had people call in quite grateful for what we found in the health exam
5126772 this is really about making hospitals and the health system just a safer place to be
5126773 to be reasonably preventable there should be solid evidence that by following guidelines the occurrence of an event can be reduced to zero or near zero
5126774 this is not the case for many of the now banned conditions
5126775 a more effective patient safety approach would be to encourage compliance with evidence based guidelines by health care professionals
5126776 we had a lot of robust discussion in the comments concerning the hospital acquired conditions we responded by removing some of those for reconsideration
5126777 we think these are very serious infections that are important to the health care system and to the patients of the united states so we will continue to look at these
5126778 you need to appropriately factor in the patient risk when determining whether a condition is reasonably avoidable
5126779 its like wishing you could cure cancer or heart disease it wont happen just because you change the payment system
5126780 its not always as clear cut as the rules appear to indicate
5126781 drug testing defrauding products are a dilemma not only for criminal justice and employment screening purposes but they also compound a larger public health issue such as drugged driving which is a primary concern for anti drug coalitions throughout the country
5126782 we want to make sure there are no doubts about the ability of anyone working in transportation to do their job as safely as possible
5126783 im going to have a stash of drugs squirreled away in the house
5126784 theres going to come a point where the quality of my life will become unbearable and at that stage it wont make sense to go on living
5126785 im not going to help you build your stash as you call it but when the time comes i promise i will not let you suffer
5126786 if things go well in the course of ones cancer treatment one has a long and intense relationship with ones oncologist if they dont one has a short and intense relationship with ones oncologist
5126787 the only reason im still alive is because the spirit wants to live
5126788 its not really me anymore not the real me anyway
5126789 because i always know how its going to end theres no uncertainty the bad guys get caught

5126791 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
5126792 no i think that was clearly a partisan statement at a rally
5126793 i respect everybody their opinions in a political campaign but thats all that was
5126794 human exploration beyond low earth orbit should be a long term goal and investment for all space faring countries with america in the lead
5126795 ive got news for john mccain my plans not going to bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster from john mccains president george w bush
5126796 represent foreign governments they represent special interests from every corner of industry so this notion that he is somehow fighting for the little guy is just nonsense
5126797 thats not who hes been fighting for hes been fighting for the same folks making out like bandits for years now
5126798 no es nada agradable ser parte de un cuerpo con tan poca aprobaci n es indudable que los esc ndalos ocasionados por algunos congresistas afectan a la popularidad del congreso y eso es preocupante porque se pone en riesgo el sistema democr tico la mesa directiva y quienes dirigen ahora los rganos del congreso tienen que tomar medidas para revertir esta situaci n
5126799 la ciudadan a vea que en efecto el congreso funciona y sirve para algo
5126800 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5126801 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5126802 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5126803 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5126804 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5126805 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5126806 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5126807 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5126808 you can make these up to one week in advance
5126809 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5126810 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5126811 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life

5126813 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5126814 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5126815 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5126816 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro

5126820 attention is an act of connection we look from where we are to what is all around us in doing so we discover where we are at the act of paying attention is what brings us peace
5126821 sometimes life is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords
5126822 if we think we have no stories it is because we have not paid enough attention to our lives most of us live lives that are far richer and more meaningful than we appreciate

5126839 this study provides the first indication that mindfulness meditation stress management training can have a direct impact on slowing hiv disease progression
5126840 the mindfulness program is a group based and low cost treatment and if this initial finding is replicated in larger samples its possible that such training can be used as a powerful complementary treatment for hiv disease alongside medications
5126841 the more mindfulness meditation classes people attended the higher the number of cd4 t cells at the studys conclusion
5126842 given the stress reduction benefits of mindfulness meditation training these findings indicate there can be health protective effects not just in people with hiv but in folks who suffer from daily stress

5126848 we calculated about 135 times hed been interrogated and about the first 120 the only interest they had was al jazeera
5126849 they told him that they thought al jazeera was an al qaeda front
5126850 they were trying to get him to finger a number of well known al jazeera journalists as being in the muslim brotherhood
5126851 they wanted me to betray the principles of my job and to turn me into a spy
5126852 if we were going to try to silence al jazeera it would be at a higher level of personnel than some cameraman trainee

5126857 im a big fan of the whole harry potter series and i am surprised daniel radcliffe suffers from dyspraxia
5126858 he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition
5126859 in the majority of children and young people with dyspraxia we cannot find the cause so the basic treatment is occupational therapy teaching them to make a plan for their actions and rehearse their movements
5126860 yes dan radcliffe does have dyspraxia this is something he has never hidden thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to ties his shoe laces and bad handwriting

5126874 the idea behind this is the person is sucking in a little bit of water and a lot of air so they feel like theyre drowning the real power of the interrogator is the fear of the unknown
5126875 but i think if youre for or against this technique the conversation about this needs to start we need to recognize what it truly is which is torture
5126876 we are reaching a group of people that dont know about the subject
5126877 thats real wrong to torture someone and i wouldnt have put a dollar in if i knew
5126878 i dont think theres a need for that i dont like it
5126879 its our chance to be silly and political and educational all at the same time
5126880 perhaps youve heard of the man eating chicken or lobster boy who was not born with hands like you and me but pinching claws hes the only magician to perform sleight of claw
5126881 the court of law and i use that term loosely in guantanamo is not recognized is not right the judge the jury the prosecutor theyre all on the same team
5126882 you cant have a real trial for omar in guantanamo
5126883 whats a student going to learn from someone who decided the best option in life was to become an instructor
5126884 well i make my students work harder than they ever thought they could
5126885 then when people try to judge me by the dollars i make and the position that i hold in life i can hold my head up and pay no attention because they are ignorant you want to know what i make

5126888 ik checkte mijn website friendfeed om te zien of er iets interessants gebeurd was ik zag tot mijn schrik dat de website elmaaltshift gebanned was
5126889 ik bezocht zijn website en zag de bekende grote rode letters
5126890 ik dacht dat ik droomde maar daarna realizeerde ik me dat ik momenteel in duitsland was en het verbod alleen turkse internet gebruikers betrof toen begreep ik ook de reden van deze bann f rat nam stelling tegen de turkse regering die vorig jaar een paar honderd websites heeft verboden
5126891 mensn raken er gewoon aan gewend als hun vrijheid wordt ingeperkt
5126892 deze vorm van protest nergens toe zal leiden omdat het turkse politici absoluut niet uitmaakt welke sites verboden zijn en wat de reden daarvoor is
5126893 hebben jullie gezocht naar madeleine bent u naar buiten gegaan om te kijken of ze daar misschien was het wiel uitgevonden
5126894 to crush your enemies see them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of the women

5126898 if they do they are prejudiced racialist a current situation and a future prospect which only a few years ago would have appeared to everyone not merely intolerable but frankly incredible has to be represented as if welcomed by all rational and right thinking people the public are literally made to say that black is white
5126899 it is because the whole power of the aggressor depends upon preventing people from seeing what is happening and from saying what they see

5126903 my favorite bum just got maracas ive been double tipping him
5126904 do you know that i have a wishlist on amazon

5126906 ken almost dropped out of the flip cup tournament because of the pressure death glare i told him to man up
5126907 i have put my penis in enough assholes that i know where its supposed to go
5126908 what i hoped for many years ago when i got to be no 1
5126909 was that if ever somebody were to take it away from me he would have to win the biggest tournaments basically dominate the game i didnt want that i would play completely bad and somebody would just pick up no 1 rafa totally deserves it
5126910 i am having an unbelievable year nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year so i want to enjoy these moments no
5126911 the reason probably that i won this title is because i had such a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village
5126912 and i think they feel the same like me no i did some photos i did some autographs but always was a pleasure because i did them with another sport man
5126913 its almost disbelief to some degree i really grew up being a team player i love team competition basketball soccer
5126914 in any case there can be few books rooted in a more profound ugliness than gregor von rezzoris memoirs of an anti semite which so vividly so feelingly so elegantly with such tender care anarchic humor and shocking honesty portrays the crucible of central europe during the first half of the twentieth century with its catastrophically toxic compound of cultural elements and historical impulses
5126915 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5126916 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5126917 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5126918 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5126919 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5126920 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5126921 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5126922 the surprise was the strength in the first quarter not the contraction in the second quarter
5126923 of course id be happy to get your pipe and slippers
5126924 what do you mean making out with strangers getting phone numbers having extended conversations with them going out for drinks is wrong
5126925 what the fuck is up with the brett favre situation
5126926 i thought i saw them giving those ugly things away at the store today
5126927 all the girls i want want nothing to do with me and all the girls who want me i want nothing to do with
5126928 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5126929 but the important points i played very good that was the difference
5126930 im pretty sad that maybe i couldnt give 100 today
5126931 its pretty sore too tight and i feel it when i move or serve or get ready for a return
5126932 i got a little lucky he moved to the other side
5126933 after that ace i felt very relaxed it was a very good sensation
5126934 it got better in the second set but it still wasnt great
5126935 i dont play against rafael nadal or roger federer or any top top players
5126936 i dont know what will happen when i play against them but it will be a good test for me
5126937 we thought we could win by improving our defense and that even if we had a reggie bush our offense would not be better than say indianapolis
5126938 and so the way for us to win in our division was to strengthen our defense and that was the decision that was made and mario is turning out to be a great defensive player for us
5126939 what i did before wasnt good enough i see it like that and i want my teammates to see it that way we all push each other
5126940 we have a lot of young guys and were getting a whole lot better year by year practice by practice snap by snap
5126941 theyve gotten a lot better theyve improved a lot over the last two years im seeing a lot more push
5126942 theyre making more plays in the backfield and we definitely need more of that out of our defensive line
5126943 we thought that role suited travis skills better amobi still has a ways to go and were working on it
5126944 he has really good speed ive been really pleased with him
5126945 every situation youre given good or bad you learn from it
5126946 i think in 2005 we assumed way too much i was taught you dont assume anything we won nine games in 2006 and then won 10 last season and hopefully we have laid the ground work to make a run again at the championship
5126947 if you go back and look at the era of the late 90s youre talking about some really great players i think were getting close to having that kind of athlete at tennessee again
5126948 i put the team first you dont want individual goals to get in the way of the team
5126949 i think i need to be more consistent as an all around player i would like to be solid in everything
5126950 if eric stays healthy and continues on the path hes on hell be one of the best players in the country

5126964 you may be confused about your own schedule today maybe you double booked yourself or perhaps you wrote down a time incorrectly but even if your calendar is in good shape you still might be late to work or for an appointment dont make feeble attempts to cover your mistake by telling a lie or even by stretching the truth be honest and deal with the consequences of your actions

5126986 i dont want to share what i will be talking about
5126987 i dont have it laid out in a concise way to share with you
5126988 we should be a nation of laws under the constitution we should have the rule of law not the rule of man
5126989 i dont know if anybody is going to be listening
5126990 all i know is they offered this free speech thing and i thought i would try
5126991 we will probably have an ecumenical church service and also have an advocate for the sanctity of life
5126992 just what its like to live in poverty and how we juggle things
5126993 the main point i want to make is that our government is not run constitutionally anymore

5127004 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million so but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is the point is the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5127005 the whole decoupling thesis has started to come apart at the seams
5127006 canada is frozen over we have arctic conditions in sweden and the uk is falling off the white cliffs of dover
5127007 the uk housing event is probably second only to the japanese 1990 land bubble in the real estate bubble hall of fame uk house prices could easily decline 50 percent from the peak and at that lower level they would still be higher than they were in 1997 as a multiple of income
5127008 if prices go all the way back to trend and history says that is extremely likely then the uk financial system will need some serious bailouts and the global ripples will be substantial

5127026 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
5127027 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
5127028 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
5127029 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
5127030 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
5127031 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
5127032 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
5127033 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
5127034 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
5127035 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
5127036 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
5127037 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
5127038 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
5127039 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
5127040 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
5127041 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans

5127045 so i jumped on his wheel and kayle followed when i felt him slowing down coming into the second to last corner i punched out and went for it
5127046 i had confidence i could hold my speed and hit out
5127047 i also knew kayle was right there and could win if i didnt
5127048 the win tonight was good for the morale but were staying hungry
5127049 this was by no means our goal winning the national title is our no 1 goal
5127050 in the japanese keirin we make a lot of money but now i have a bronze medal

5127064 there would have been no war propaganda without the war no atrocity stories without atrocities although the entente press wildly exagerrated what went on in belgium there is no question that the german army did commit atrocities there in 1914 according to evidence from the diaries of german soldiers and other reliable sources all the advancing german armies executed civilians including women and priests altogether about 5 500 belgian civilians were deliberately killed by the german army most of them in the eleven day period from 18 14th august 1914 and at least another 500 in france the germans also used civilians as human shields and razed numerous villages to the ground in one case an eighteen year old girl was bayonnetted to death there were also numerous rapes in occupied france

5127095 i think its important not only for the quarterbacks but for the receivers too
5127096 our conversations between me and dana were all about that were out there every day with four or five guys quarterbacks throwing nine or 10 different receivers balls
5127097 so today when we start narrowing our receivers down one quarterback getting more reps than the other three or four is going to speed up the progression of our passing game

5127223 isto para n s era intoler vel aprendemos com um mestre a verdade do core aprendemos que para que muitos vivessem em liberdade no futuro uns poucos deveriam se sacrificar no presente quando este mestre desapareceu os remanescentes de n s decidiram criar uma corp para manter este ideal vivo assim fundamos a death law

5127389 ainda n o hora de comemorar o core acabou com a antares mas um perigo maior esta vindo neste momento para c um grupo de naves da armada incluindo 3 cruzadores e 6 fragatas esta se deslocando da fronteira para o n cleo enquanto falamos
5127390 urge que elaboremos uma estrat gia para lidar com esta amea a eles formaram 2 grupos um com a belerofonte e a moscou e 3 fragatas e outro com a evententerprise e mais 3 fragatas ambos os grupos vem diretamente para n s e fecharam qualquer poss vel caminho para fora do n cleo estamos em uma armadilha e temos de achar um jeito de sair dela
5127391 ign cio katan um dos mais experientes comandantes da armada
5127392 eu e uss o conhecemos lutamos ao seu lado na fronteira ele um comandante r gido segue o manual a risca
5127393 voc pode nos fornecer informa es valiosas ou pode decidir n o lutar contra seu amigo
5127394 falo por mim e por uss quando digo que nossa lealdade esta com a dl at o fim lutaremos contra qualquer um que seja uma amea a contra nossa corpora o ou contra nossos ideais

5127397 a evententerprise uma nave extremamente bem armada e com escudos poderosos mas dentro da forma o defensiva ela n o pode atirar j que as fragatas formam um triangulo ao redor dela as fragatas ficam a distancia exata do alcance das armas anti ca as uma das outras assim se um ca a conseguir penetrar por entre elas vai se ver de cara com todo o poder de fogo da capit nea de katan em mat ria de ca as ela pode lan ar 50 ca as para a batalha em 5 minutos
5127398 j loco ruiz outro assunto nunca se sabe o que ele vai fazer ele tanto pode seguir uma manobra padr o quanto avan ar com seu cruzador para cima dos ca as ele tem uma tripula o t o doida quanto ele que se atira no combate sem medo

5127425 many believe that asbestos is a problem which was faced by shipyard workers and laggers decades ago
5127426 if we do not act now a whole new generation of people will develop mesothelioma in 30 years time
5127427 we whole heartedly support the health and safety executives campaign but we would call for it to go further and for it to be backed up by television advertising and a greater information led campaign to ensure the message hits home
5127428 asbestos is known to be a killer of building maintenance workers the main risk is from mesothelioma an entirely preventable disease controls to prevent exposure to asbestos fibres are well known they must be applied building workers lives depend on it
5127429 i like so many other tradesmen was exposed to asbestos in the past and many of us are now paying a terrible price it is unforgivable that young workers today continue to be exposed to asbestos no cost should be spared in preventing further exposure to this deadly dust
5127430 so yea how do i make the link and how do i put it on my site

5127435 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5127436 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5127437 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5127438 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5127448 todays great reason number 4 is extreme self care whats that you may ask and why do you need to practise it extreme self care is the art of investing in you going out of your way to invest in you first because you are the finest asset in your own business think for a moment how many people depend on you within your business and on the income you create what would your business be without you so thats why its vital for your business no ifs or buts or when i get times make time first end of no arguing please and no wimpering at the back invest in you feed and nourish your mind body spirit creativity energy do stuff that makes you sing and shine and excel do whats really important for you to keep you healthy and in the zone and do it first before the demands of the world and your work kick in do it in your best time prioritise it we will find out what this is and we will make sure you do it its such a simple formula and i see my clients getting great results from it when they do it the spirit is willing and the flesh is often very weak and i have tricks this is what i notice when my clients identify their routine for spiritual self care essential maintenance and the stuff that makes them feel really really good for no reason at all guess what their business works better too funny that we all know it and its yet another thing we dont prioritise because we are too busy because we are full of excuses because we are full of shit what do you love and do you do enough of it hmm what are you like
5127449 see 0246 thats usually the argument of australians when gb beats them at anything but i think if you look at countries like jamaica nz slovakia and a couple of others you will find than not even oz can claim that one this time around

5127459 the moral economy of the english crowd in the eighteenth century
5127460 actions on such a scale indicate an extraordinarily deep rooted pattern of behaviour and belief these popular actions were legitimised by the old paternalist moral economy
5127461 in considering only this one form of mob action we have come upon unsuspected complexities for behind every such form of popular direct action some legitimising notion of right is to be found
5127462 we have been examining a pattern of social protest which derives from a consensus as to the moral economy of the commonweal in times of dearth

5127473 in eukaryotes the process of messenger rna 3 end formation involves endonucleolytic cleavage of the transcript followed by synthesis of the poly a tail the complex machinery involved in this maturation process contains two proteins of the metallo beta lactamase mbl superfamily the 73 and 100 kda subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor cpsf by using an in vitro system to assess point mutations in these two mammalian proteins we found that conserved residues from the mbl motifs of both polypeptides are required for assembly of the endonuclease activity that cleaves histone pre mrnas this indicates that cpsf73 and cpsf100 act together in the process of maturation of eukaryotic pre messenger rnas similar to other members of the mbl family rnases z and j which function as homodimers

5127583 the central question that emerges is whether the white community in the south is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail politically and culturally in areas where it does not predominate numerically the sobering answer is yes the white community is so entitled because for the time being it is the advanced race

5127613 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
5127614 the interests behind the bush administration such as the cfr the trilateral commission founded by brzezinski for david rockefeller and the bilderberger group have prepared for and are now moving to implement open world dictatorship within the next five years
5127615 but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book p
5127616 the attitude of the american public toward the external projection of american power has been much more ambivalent the public supported americas engagement in world war ii largely because of the shock effect of the japanese attack on pearl harbor
5127617 for america the chief geopolitical prize is eurasia now a non eurasian power is preeminent in eurasia and americas global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the eurasian continent is sustained p
5127618 americas withdrawal from the world or because of the sudden emergence of a successful rival would produce massive international instability it would prompt global anarchy
5127619 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical eurasia is the globes largest continent and is geopolitically axial a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the worlds gnp and about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
5127620 two basic steps are thus required first to identify the geostrategically dynamic eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them second to formulate specific u s policies to offset co opt and or control the above
5127621 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together
5127622 henceforth the united states may have to determine how to cope with regional coalitions that seek to push america out of eurasia thereby threatening americas status as a global power
5127623 uzbekistan nationally the most vital and the most populous of the central asian states represents the major obstacle to any renewed russian control over the region its independence is critical to the survival of the other central asian states and it is the least vulnerable to russian pressures
5127624 moreover they the central asian republics are of importance from the standpoint of security and historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and more powerful neighbors namely russia turkey and iran with china also signaling an increasing political interest in the region but the eurasian balkans are infinitely more important as a potential economic prize an enormous concentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region in addition to important minerals including gold
5127625 the worlds energy consumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades estimates by the u s department of energy anticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015 with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the far east the momentum of asias economic development is already generating massive pressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy and the central asian region and the caspian sea basin are known to contain reserves of natural gas and oil that dwarf those of kuwait the gulf of mexico or the north sea
5127626 uzbekistan is in fact the prime candidate for regional leadership in central asia
5127627 once pipelines to the area have been developed turkmenistans truly vast natural gas reserves augur a prosperous future for the countrys people p
5127628 in fact an islamic revival already abetted from the outside not only by iran but also by saudi arabia is likely to become the mobilizing impulse for the increasingly pervasive new nationalisms determined to oppose any reintegration under russian and hence infidel control
5127629 for pakistan the primary interest is to gain geostrategic depth through political influence in afghanistan and to deny to iran the exercise of such influence in afghanistan and tajikistan and to benefit eventually from any pipeline construction linking central asia with the arabian sea
5127630 turkmenistan has been actively exploring the construction of a new pipeline through afghanistan and pakistan to the arabian sea
5127631 it follows that americas primary interest is to help ensure that no single power comes to control this geopolitical space and that the global community has unhindered financial and economic access to it
5127632 chinas growing economic presence in the region and its political stake in the areas independence are also congruent with americas interests
5127633 america is now the only global superpower and eurasia is the globes central arena hence what happens to the distribution of power on the eurasian continent will be of decisive importance to americas global primacy and to americas historical legacy
5127634 without sustained and directed american involvement before long the forces of global disorder could come to dominate the world scene and the possibility of such a fragmentation is inherent in the geopolitical tensions not only of todays eurasia but of the world more generally
5127635 with warning signs on the horizon across europe and asia any successful american policy must focus on eurasia as a whole and be guided by a geostrategic design
5127636 that puts a premium on maneuver and manipulation in order to prevent the emergence of a hostile coalition that could eventually seek to challenge americas primacy
5127637 the most immediate task is to make certain that no state or combination of states gains the capacity to expel the united states from eurasia or even to diminish significantly its decisive arbitration role
5127638 in the long run global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state hence america is not only the first as well as the only truly global superpower but it is also likely to be the very last
5127639 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multi cultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat
5127640 in 1983 4 i warned of a take over of world governments being orchestrated by these people
5127641 it was a criminal society that i was dealing with
5127642 the people of the western world have been trained to be good consumers to focus on money sports cars beauty consumer goods
5127643 we also need education for citizens to be more efficient in their democracies in addition to education for politicians that will create a new network of elites based upon character and social intelligence
5127644 rest is not idleness and to lie sometimes on the grass under the trees on a summers day listening to the murmur of water or watching the clouds float across the sky is by no means a waste of time
5127645 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution
5127646 at this point i think the international community has to step in otherwise we fear a growing extremism this kind of anger comes at the worst time
5127647 pakistan has to put its political house in order before we can say what it means for kashmir

5127655 everyones pretty calm at the moment but theres no doubt this is going to cause travel chaos around europe
5127656 we have a flight which is supposed to be leaving malaga airport for gatwick at 4 50pm local time but it will have to be delayed
5127657 even if the passengers were here on time which theyre not going to be there wouldnt be a flight crew

5127680 its an honor to be featured in this outstanding magazine
5127681 extraordinaire has a huge readership and will give us tremendous exposure as we continue to explode our business during 2008 and beyond the magazine did a fantastic job highlighting our company our business opportunity and our rising stars
5127682 every situation youre given good or bad you learn from it
5127683 i think in 2005 we assumed way too much i was taught you dont assume anything we won nine games in 2006 and then won 10 last season and hopefully we have laid the ground work to make a run again at the championship
5127684 if you go back and look at the era of the late 90s youre talking about some really great players i think were getting close to having that kind of athlete at tennessee again
5127685 i put the team first you dont want individual goals to get in the way of the team
5127686 i think i need to be more consistent as an all around player i would like to be solid in everything
5127687 if eric stays healthy and continues on the path hes on hell be one of the best players in the country
5127688 we thought we could win by improving our defense and that even if we had a reggie bush our offense would not be better than say indianapolis
5127689 and so the way for us to win in our division was to strengthen our defense and that was the decision that was made and mario is turning out to be a great defensive player for us
5127690 what i did before wasnt good enough i see it like that and i want my teammates to see it that way we all push each other
5127691 we have a lot of young guys and were getting a whole lot better year by year practice by practice snap by snap
5127692 theyve gotten a lot better theyve improved a lot over the last two years im seeing a lot more push
5127693 theyre making more plays in the backfield and we definitely need more of that out of our defensive line
5127694 we thought that role suited travis skills better amobi still has a ways to go and were working on it
5127695 he has really good speed ive been really pleased with him
5127696 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5127697 but the important points i played very good that was the difference
5127698 im pretty sad that maybe i couldnt give 100 today
5127699 its pretty sore too tight and i feel it when i move or serve or get ready for a return
5127700 i got a little lucky he moved to the other side
5127701 after that ace i felt very relaxed it was a very good sensation
5127702 it got better in the second set but it still wasnt great
5127703 i dont play against rafael nadal or roger federer or any top top players
5127704 i dont know what will happen when i play against them but it will be a good test for me
5127705 he may be the most dangerous guy in this tournament in transition
5127706 is that like a trick question or a prediction or something
5127707 i hope at the end of the season that i feel like i made the right decision i hope jets fans and people throughout the nfl feel i made the right decision id love to win the super bowl but im not going to make any guarantees all i can say is ill do my best and hopefully thats enough
5127708 id be foolish to think that on opening day i would know this offense like ive known the offense that ive been in the past the bottom line is its still football
5127709 im not talking about the physical side because brett can still throw the football with anyone out there im talking about the mental aspect learning the offense its not that easy
5127710 im very open to new ideas new thinking free spirits that type of thing
5127711 there are some things that as a coach you dont want to coach him out of a good play you dont want to out coach a guys instincts when its working you dont want to mess that up
5127712 you can have the best players possible but it doesnt guarantee you wins i want these guys to know what im about how i play what type of leadership i have im not going to call team meetings im not going to rah rah im going to do what i have to do pat guys on the back hug them pick them up off the ground and hope they do the same for me and hope thats enough to win
5127713 when you meet him you can tell hes a superstar but he doesnt tell you that hes got the aura and charisma but hes down to earth
5127714 but they were in green bay as well there werent nearly as many people but those people in wisconsin theyd come to expect winning

5127727 what about if i make you watch anime all day
5127728 ok then she should be at the officers club now wheres my yaoi
5127729 and one more thing clean up this place its smells like a city dump
5127730 is that guy wearing denim shorts for real or for 90s
5127731 is that girl semi goth mall metal for the 90s or did no one tell her it was themed
5127732 redefining abortion federal officials considering a rule allowing health care workers to refuse to provide contraceptives
5127733 the russians know that were bogged down in iraq even if we wanted to propose a military deterrent were not able to do that very easily now because of their iraq policies that senator mccain would continue the russians know that were more addicted to foreign oil now than we were on 9 11 we have to break that addiction to be strong they realize the budget deficits were running we have to go to the chinese the japanese even the mexicans to borrow money thats not what a great strong country does john mccain would continue those polices barack would change them thats the kind of commander in chief we need to make america strong
5127734 vegas is nice but what made this convention special was the experience honestly without the experience everybody is thinking of not going next year and saving money for comic con in san diego
5127735 over a thousand people are on a waiting list at this clinic currently
5127736 the list changes every day some people die while others enrol it is hard to say how many have died because our data collection system is not up to date
5127737 at times we utilise volunteers in conducting counselling sessions but we cannot rely on them we need permanent staff on board if we intend to run a proper art clinic
5127738 i am scared that i will die before accessing treatment
5127739 i know i have to attend three sessions before they can put me on treatment but it seems very long to me i feel weak and my weight keeps dropping but there is nothing i can do besides waiting and hoping my turn will come soon
5127740 its not just her there are hundreds of people who are still waiting to begin treatment
5127741 there is no way she can start with treatment before attending the third and last session it is south african policy
5127742 treatment is available prices have dropped and funding has increased but the number of people dying before they can access treatment continues to escalate nurses and doctors are dying of aids they are also overwhelmed by the hiv related workload and on top of it paid peanuts
5127743 for policymakers our message is that you will be held responsible if you are not reactive or flexible enough to find solutions to the staff shortages quickly
5127744 in many cases people present at the clinic when they are critically ill and their cd4 counts are very low this person cannot be treated immediately because the arv drugs can kill him he has to be nursed to health and then begin with treatment
5127745 as a woman i demand my national government and the g8 to make their efforts more sensitive and responsive to womens problems
5127746 the rostock scene was not different from a scene in ugandas kampala or zimbabwes harare
5127747 it is a mistake to consider the protesters as a leftist homogenous block as there are many differences in their ideologies and approaches to protest
5127748 environmentalists will always protect their side of the story but what uganda needs today is to protect the lives and health of their citizens
5127749 if you have lived and worked here in germany for any considerable time you would know that this is a typical view of afrika portrayed by the axel springer verlags newspapers for decades
5127750 whats the harm in reporting both sides the point is that there is a lot of good positive news in africa choosing to focus only on the bad just shows a hopeless continent
5127751 the question we have to ask geldof is after taking viewing the image how did you change the situation of the young kid
5127752 why do we continue to perpetuate the need to say africa when the differences across this vast continent are so large
5127753 malaria is not just a health problem it is an economic problem as well
5127754 i would have agreed with your comments about geldofs choice of photo if only things were that simple
5127755 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5127756 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5127757 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5127758 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5127759 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5127760 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5127761 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5127762 das unterschiedliche k rperliche niveau der spieler hing auch damit zusammen dass wir im vergleich zur wm 2006 eine woche weniger vorbereitung hatten wir m ssen jetzt mit der liga besprechen wie wir das im hinblick auf s dafrika verbessern k nnen
5127763 ob wir nicht wieder den einen oder anderen leistungstest einschieben k nnen die haben wir im vergangenen jahr aus zeitmangel gar nicht mehr durchgef hrt

5127780 we all know what adolescents are like the fact that they also have a package of hiv with them makes it a hard situation
5127781 as is natural they become experimental they have natural desires so one of the biggest challenges we have is handling sexuality in our adolescents
5127782 i am in a sexual relationship but i have not yet told my status to my partner whose sero status i am not aware of i am afraid to tell her what if she rejects me
5127783 as a woman i demand my national government and the g8 to make their efforts more sensitive and responsive to womens problems

5127792 i would have agreed with your comments about geldofs choice of photo if only things were that simple
5127793 they are only going to be part of the healthcare system by identifying expectant mothers and forwarding them to the appropriate healthcare facility
5127794 we cannot realise the millennium development goals if tbas are delivering mothers in the villages
5127795 i had been told by the nurses here at mulago that i would have to deliver from here but at the time the contractions came i had no money to hire a cab and it was in the middle of the night
5127796 usually they sit outside they move around my structure briefly sign in my visitors book i serve them something to drink and then they leave
5127797 the ministry has ignored the work done by tbas it says tbas should be supervised by district hospitals but this also is not being done
5127798 when i was delivering my firstborn she treated me like my own mother that is why i was not worried when i returned to her deep in the night with my second pregnancy
5127799 tbas are going to be referral points but will not deliver babies
5127800 as a woman i demand my national government and the g8 to make their efforts more sensitive and responsive to womens problems

5127810 there is no fear of a nuclear bomb coming out of this region but the bigger danger is that a small amount of uranium combined with conventional explosive terrorists could make a dirty bomb that would make an area the size of the citys square mile unusable for 30 or 40 years
5127811 the decision was made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our portfolio and enables us to maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
5127812 our company will turn 110 years old this week and while much has changed since 1898 our dedication to being the industry leader in the areas where we do business to serve our customers communities and employees has not we have always been an innovative company and we must continue to change and evolve to position us for success for another 100 years
5127813 we actually began to do it for ourselves and then we thought it would be much more dynamic if we included the rest of the caribbean it would be lovely if we could find other platforms where we can work together sports and news would be good if we can all commit we really appreciate the enthusiasm so far and i hope it will be the beginning of new ways to work together
5127814 the process has been quick the final settlement was negotiated less than 36 hours after the original complaint was made the apology has been prominent and proportionate and the pcc costs nothing to use
5127815 the voting used to be about the songs now its about national prejudices we the uk are on our own we had a very good song a very good singer we came joint last i dont want to be presiding over another debacle
5127816 i was considering giving up before this years contest and now i have to say im very doubtful about ever wanting to do eurovision again
5127817 its totally legitimate to vote for the song you liked best
5127818 the real news the real facts of the matter didnt conform to what they were trying to report and therefore they wouldnt let me report it
5127819 i felt that i had no choice but to resign
5127820 mass media hadnt suffered the losses of that extent even during the first war in chechnya
5127821 if ostensibly privileged defendants like us can be baselessly smeared wrongfully deprived falsely accused shamelessly persecuted innocently convicted and grotesquely punished it doesnt take much to figure out what happens to the vulnerable and the powerless
5127822 inability to generate sufficient advertising revenues to sustain its ongoing operations
5127823 he came in as a safety and became something we havent seen in years at syracuse sideline to sideline playmaking linebacker
5127824 he was the fattest man when he got off the plane he didnt want to talk about how he turned in all those names
5127825 respectfully i am going to disagree about senator mccains service
5127826 respectfully i am going to disagree about senator mccains service i think his policies are terrible i think his service was honorable

5127832 nossa equipe uma equipe jovem que est amadurecendo durante o campeonato acho que quando eles tiveram o jogador expulso faltou um pouco de malandragem para girar a bola ter calma para criar a oportunidade de fazer gol
5127833 a gente tinha quatro cinco jogadores para tr s deles na verdade foi uma desaten o nossa
5127834 a gente sai um pouco frustrado porque se preparou muito forte para vencer esta partida acho que fizemos uma atua o razo vel mas para vencer o palmeiras ficou provado que n o basta jogar razoavelmente
5127835 o campo de futebol est parecendo uma igreja voc pode conversar cobrar o rbitro como eu fiz mas n o xinguei
5127836 o campo de futebol est parecendo uma igreja voc pode conversar cobrar o rbitro como eu fiz mas n o xinguei o basquete o handebol o v lei todos os esportes permitem isso s o futebol que n o
5127837 eu gesticulei mas n o ofendi tem que acabar com isso que t cnico gesticula para jogar o rbitro contra a torcida j xinguei muitos rbitros sim mas hoje n o posso nem viver a partida os rbitros t m que entender que n o s o padres nem os senhores absolutos do jogo
5127838 nunca apoiei a indisciplina e n o vou aceitar que falem isso falo para meus jogadores n o ofenderem o rbitro n o darem cotovelada nem agredirem ningu m mas os meus jogadores podem sim conversar com o rbitro isso faz parte
5127839 quando o jogador caiu na expuls o do fabinho capixaba eu que j joguei bola vi que ele n o foi tocado e o pessoal que assisti o jogo para mim de l de cima tamb m confirmou perdi um jogador em um momento importante do jogo
5127840 temos o k ssio e o sidny n o acho que precisamos de outro lateral no elenco
5127841 hoje vi o palmeiras fazer o seu melhor jogo da competi o podem falar foi s 1 a 0 mas n s fomos para cima atacamos mesmo nas dificuldades esse o time que eu quero
5127842 fizemos um primeiro tempo bom n s criamos quatro cinco chances e o goleiro foi muito importante principalmente em um chute do kl ber que normalmente bate e entra no gol mas ele segurou
5127843 o dorival j nior t cnico dos paranaenses est de parab ns montou um time com muitos jogadores habilidosos e que sabem o que querem dentro de campo
5127844 o coritiba s amea ou em uma bobeada do sandro silva que deixou de marcar a segunda bola e o rapaz rodrigo mancha acertou o travess o
5127845 gostei do everton porque foi ele quem desafunilou o jogo no segundo tempo
5127846 gostei do everton porque foi ele quem desafunilou o jogo no segundo tempo o jogo estava muito por dentro e ele conseguiu colocar velocidade pelos lados amparado tamb m pelo maur cio e pelo conca pecamos no cruzamento no ltimo passe mas ele foi muito bem hoje
5127847 no segundo tempo conseguimos equilibrar o segundo tempo com a entrada do everton e por m ritos dele a defesa do galo acabou se confundido o everton se imp s em campo
5127848 fiquei muito feliz de estrear com essa bela vit ria com muita garra e ra a n s v nhamos trabalhando para que essa estr ia fosse boa e hoje consegui dar minha contribui o sa mos muito felizes com esses tr s pontos
5127849 foi tudo perfeito com exce o do sofrimento mas assim mesmo para sair dessa situa o n o vai ser natural tem que ter doa o que sair de campo morto de cansa o e hoje vencemos porque eles deram a vida tiveram muita ra a e determina o no segundo tempo principalmente
5127850 claro que essa troca de treinadores motiva e foi isso que aconteceu hoje n o foi um grande jogo mas n o faltou empenho e disposi o para mostrar para o treinador esse come o de segundo turno a gente est vendo que o cuca uma pessoa que gosta de montar a equipe e que quer sair dessa situa o e vai nos ajudar nesse segundo turno
5127851 antes do jogo ele pediu para que todos sa ssem de campo esgotados n s nos conscientizamos bem disso e todos procuraram dar o sangue demos o m ximo acho que essa determina o foi marcante para esse tr s pontos a nosso favor
5127852 os resultados positivos deixam a equipe emocionalmente bem conseguimos cinco vit rias consecutivas no brasileiro e agora teremos tr s jogos seguidos no rio para garantirmos a perman ncia no g 4 quem sabe podemos at brigar pelo t tulo brasileiro
5127853 today the commonwealth state and territory governments have placed the australian consumer front and centre as we took an important step on the road to achieving a single national consumer law
5127854 these reforms will bring australias consumer protection laws into the twenty first century and reflect the rudd governments commitment to a seamless national economy
5127855 business is also set to benefit from a reduction in compliance costs as nine sets of consumer laws are folded into a new single national consumer law
5127856 this agreement is another clear example of the fresh approach that the rudd government is taking to cooperative federalism
5127857 the ministerial council has agreed to propose to the business regulation and competition working group brcwg that all australian jurisdictions agree to adopt a national consumer law based on the consumer protection provisions of the trade practices act
5127858 todays agreement builds on mccas earlier agreement to introduce a new national product safety regulation and enforcement system as well as the agreement of the state and territories to transfer their responsibilities for the regulation of consumer credit to the commonwealth
5127859 the circumstances surrounding his resignation are disappointing but i am very pleased that des walsh has accepted an expanded role in the company
5127860 des and i worked together at disney in the successful expansion of the video business and for the last four years at herbalife he has been instrumental to our very strong relationship with our distributors
5127861 our distributors are the key to our success and des is known and respected worldwide for his leadership
5127862 you see killbots have a preset kill limit knowing their weakness i sent wave after wave of my own men at them until they reached their limit and shutdown kif show them the medal i won
5127863 and by the time i made the decision to transition my gender dissonance had gotten so bad that it completely consumed me it hurt more than any pain physical or emotional that i had ever experienced when i made the decision to transition i honestly had no idea what it would be like for me to live as female the only thing i knew for sure was that pretending to be male was slowly killing me
5127864 a la miss que casi se cae y pudo evitarlo sola
5127865 i think what were seeing is an overall reduction but there are certainly some categories of crime that are of concern to us
5127866 one of those would be robberies and weve seen an increase in robberies the other would be theft from motor vehicles
5127867 we just need to get a better idea of when theyre likely to start
5127868 now its likely many of the start dates will be staggered which will be a good thing but thats what we got to check out
5127869 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5127870 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5127871 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5127872 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5127873 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5127874 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5127875 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5127876 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5127877 they told me i had to cancel my current service before ordering installing u verse
5127878 i had comcast i had charter at same time as u verse
5127879 they are using our lines amp equipment to offer competing service at a lower price but they are not paying to maintain them
5127880 they ameritech sbc at amp t know who all of our customers are and if we dont have protection they could simply come in and take over all of those accounts
5127881 y esto que les he escrito podr a ser suficiente para satisfacer cualquier hombre razonable de que existen serpientes voladoras pterod ctilos y dragones dinosaurios en el mundo
5127882 it was made of snow white gleaming china on its top stood a wee gold coloured teapot and a gold coloured saucer
5127883 whatever religion romance and patriotism i have i owe largely to the violin and pa playing in the twilight
5127884 pas fiddle was so much a part of the little house books that it was almost a character in those stories like most fiddlers of his time pa ingalls was probably self taught as a musician no one in the family thought to ask him how he acquired his fiddle on the frontier on each move west the fiddle was carefully packed among the quilts for safe keeping
5127885 this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord
5127886 it would have much easier if i had only known such and such
5127887 the road to knowledge begins with the turn of the page
5127888 some books are to be tasted others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested
5127889 this is an outdoor cookbook not many supermarkets are as well stocked as a forest or a sand dune or a back yard the sea makes a nice sink and so does a puddle at the end of a hose recipes are included for such delicacies as tossed leaves bark sandwich daisy dip and honeysuckle wine very young homemakers are instructed to take pains in preparation and serve with a flourish all dolls who love the sweet feel of seaweed on the tongue and the crunch of pine needles will be welcome guests
5127890 this is a cookbook for dolls it is written for kind climates and summertime it is an outdoor cookbook because dolls dote on mud when properly prepared you can use a tree stump for a counter for a stove there is the sun or a flat stone and ovens are everywhere youll find them under bushes in sandboxes or behind trees doll cookery is not a very exacting art the time it takes to cook a casserole depends upon how long your dolls are able to sit at the table without falling over and if a recipe calls for something you can use a measuring cup or a tea cup or a buttercup it doesnt much matter what does matter is that you select the best ingredients available set a fine table and serve with style
5127891 well i guess we just missed them but next time well catch them
5127892 silly mice dont they know that paper fire is not real
5127893 mama they needed that little cradle for all those tiny babies or they would have to sleep on the cold hard floor
5127894 the secret garden is always open now open and awake and alive if you look the right way you can see that the whole world is a garden
5127895 on sunday september 7th 14 canadian cities will join in the only national fundraising event dedicated to overcoming ovarian cancer the winners walk of hope the annual walk has raised more than 3 million for ovarian cancer support and awareness programs across the country including resources for newly diagnosed women awareness campaigns targeted at well women education sessions for medical students and health professionals and research in ovarian cancer
5127896 on sunday september 7th 14 canadian cities will join in the only national fundraising event dedicated to overcoming ovarian cancer the winners walk of hope
5127897 dont change anything about your appearance although losing a bit of weight wouldnt go a miss
5127898 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5127899 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5127900 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5127901 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5127902 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5127903 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5127904 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5127905 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5127906 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5127907 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5127908 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5127909 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5127910 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5127911 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5127912 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5127913 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5127914 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5127915 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5127916 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5127917 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5127918 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5127919 we still have a controversey with the newton family about where he will go
5127920 one place i like one place his father likes and one place morgan likes i like clemson were down to clemson and one other thats all i can say right now i know clemson is my favorite we all have our favorites the favorites cross each other and over lap he doesnt really care he just wants to play
5127921 the real answer that accurately reflects his record at what point does this baby receive human rights according to barack obama never not at conception not in the first second or third trimester not when the babys three quarters of the way delivered not even at birth as he voted three times as an illinois state senator against the born alive infant protection act
5127922 l sense a lot of social conservatives pulling their hair out on obamas marriage answer of course he says he supports marriage between a man and a woman but of course he says he opposed the marriage amendment in california
5127923 you cannot square the circle as he is trying to do either you support marriage or you do not he says one thing by his actions he indicates another thing
5127924 i thought mccain was the winner but i thought that obama did well with people who are not critical thinkers
5127925 i also thought senator mccain did very well i was particularly impressed by his answer on people he admired he went right to general petraeus and i contrast that to senator obama who when asked who influences him the most he mentioned his wife his grandmother those are safe nominations
5127926 i think that senator mccain closed the deal i think he made a clear contract between himself and barack obama many evangelicals will vote for him
5127927 the first game is always a real big challenge because you never know exactly what a team is going to do
5127928 you could go into the game and they could be in an entirely different offense or defense than what you might have seen have different people in different places its very hard to prepare for a first game of the season
5127929 you just need to play at game speed to get your timing down and that doesnt happen in one week
5127930 when youre not as experienced a game like this against a team that is very skilled you have to be able to make plays at the right time you make a mistake against a team like orrville and they can make you pay by going the distance theyre very explosive and theyre a lot like dover in that regard
5127931 we were up 14 0 at halftime come out in the second half and threw two picks that get returned for scores and we get beat
5127932 that was because of the inexperience of our quarterback who was starting his first varsity game but that kid ended up throwing for 4 000 yards in his career so he turned out to be pretty good
5127933 experience is a huge factor in your first couple games of the season two years ago we started 1 4 and then we win out and win the league its just because we didnt have the experience we didnt have the timing and we just werent ready to make the key plays in the key situations that you have to do to win close games we didnt start to do that until we got more experience under our belts
5127934 you set the standard so high and you lose one series and ask whats wrong
5127935 thats what were saying weve been riding the wave so long we have to get another wave
5127936 jeremy would start and i would finish i told him during the anthem im going to come in and save it for you
5127937 but if he doesnt pitch like he did we dont have the chance to win he did a great job
5127938 he knows hes the guy in charge and he knows the system
5127939 hes more comfortable with the players that surround him and that allows him to be better hes been improving ever since camp started
5127940 we all came in and worked hard its nothing but a plus for us heading into the season
5127941 a week by week decision based on what were seeing
5127942 part of being successful as an offense is running the ball and being able to adapt on the run
5127943 ya syaikh ahmad aku malu kepada tuhanku dan para malaikat disebabkan dosa dosa umatku
5127944 engkau tidak mengetahui apa yang telah mereka orang orang yang terlempar dari telaga pent ada adakan sepeninggalmu sesungguhnya mereka telah murtad sepeninggalmu
5127945 dan aku menjadi saksi terhadap mereka selama aku berada di antara mereka maka setelah engkau wafatkan angkat aku engkaulah yang mengawasi mereka dan engkau adalah maha menyaksikan atas segala sesuatu
5127946 barangsiapa yang tiada diberi cahaya petunjuk oleh allah tiadalah ia mempunyai cahaya sedikitpun
5127947 alangkah jeleknya kata kata yang keluar dari mulut mereka mereka tidak mengatakan sesuatu kecuali dusta
5127948 sesungguhnya kami menolong rasul rasul kami dan orang orang yang beriman dalam kehidupan dunia dan pada hari berdirinya saksi saksi hari kiamat
5127949 barangsiapa yang bermimpi melihatku di dalam mimpinya maka sungguh ia telah melihat aku seperti waktu terjaga sebab syaithan tidak bisa menyerupaiku

5128004 esta sociedad lamentable que s lo vive para el consumo y la cirug a pl stica
5128005 no s por qu me incomoda tanto esa frase dice el amigo crees de verdad que vivimos s lo para el consumo y la cirug a pl stica pero a n siendo as este desprecio tuyo por la sociedad realmente existente no lo es tambi n por su gente me preocupan tus aires ut picos y milenaristas a veces pareciera que dices yo desde mi conexi n con el esp ritu tengo derecho a juzgar a la sociedad y no s lo la juzgo como una nueva sodoma o gomorra sino que adem s s por qu se ha degradado por su apego a la raz n
5128006 otras sociedades que no se sometieron a la raz n sino a la religi n son por ello mejores que la nuestra hoy sabemos que no se trata de religi n sino de religiosidad no de dioses personales que nos juzguen sino de amar al pr jimo pero esta nueva forma de concebir la espiritualidad no es producto del esfuerzo de la raz n para liberarnos de los dioses no es gracias a la civilizaci n occidental que se est n abriendo paso los derechos humanos no son la libertad la igualdad y la democracia productos tambi n de ese esfuerzo no son precisamente los pa ses de mayor bienestar material los que empiezan a pensar en el post materialismo y en todo caso qu nos impide aumentar el consumo y al mismo tiempo desarrollar el esp ritu

5128013 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5128014 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5128015 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5128016 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5128017 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5128018 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5128019 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5128020 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5128021 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5128022 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5128023 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5128024 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5128025 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5128042 i was so impressed i loved the stretching exercises these exercises are versatile for athletes of different sports i cant wait to use some of these ideas
5128043 when i showed my children the book and then did the exercises at the park they thought it was a blast my 8 year old started teaching his friends
5128044 awesome concept i really like this because all the exercises engage core muscles
5128045 there are great exercises in this book that you probably never would have thought of and its always great to try new and different exercises
5128046 great job karen i thought this was very clever many people think expensive gym equipment is needed for proper exercise

5128050 i think we are finished in the market the misfortune of the national team in china means the return of three important players to us it seems to me the team has been reinforced well
5128051 we now have access to the champions league we have a 65 per cent chance of doing well we cant underestimate the importance of europe both from the point of view of our image or economically to be in europe or win europe is not a simple thing to return to nor is being ranked among the top three sides in the league
5128052 im pleased about that now im not the only wee man at ibrox
5128053 seriously he looks sharp considering hes not had as much pre season training as the rest of the squad
5128054 hell be a good signing hes a young talent a youth international who has played for valencia and gained experience on loan at other clubs in europe and moving here can only help him further
5128055 there are a lot of players at clubs like valencia barcelona and real madrid who they hope can do well on loan before bringing them back
5128056 at real madrid for example its scary they have about half their squad out on loan at other clubs in spain
5128057 mas delaine dress was beautiful it was a dark green with a little pattern all over it that looked like ripe strawberries a dressmaker had made it in the east in the place where ma came from when she married pa and moved out west to the big woods in wisconsin ma had been very fashionable before she married pa and a dressmaker had made her clothes the delaine was kept wrapped in paper and laid away laura and mary had never seen ma wear it but she had shown it to them once she had let them touch the beautiful dark red buttons that buttoned the basque up the front and then had shown them how neatly the whalebones were put in the seams inside with hundreds of little criss cross stitches
5128058 why thank you for noticing them these belonged to my mother and i was missing her just now these buttons were on her favorite dress when she passed away i made myself a dress and placed them on it
5128059 ive had three different dresses with these buttons on them having them makes me feel near to her thank you so much for letting me share this memory with you it has made my day
5128060 pagcor expressly professes and repeatedly advertises that its many and different gambling activities are in support of social projects basically intended for the common welfare of poor the poor and less fortunate in particular if that is the case why will it refuse to pay e vat which is adamantly and repeatedly said as primarily intended to help the indigent and miserable in the country
5128061 such are the awesome and troublesome attributes of pagcor directly under malaca ang with but a staff function it becomes understandable though unacceptable that the government gambling corporation appears ultimately untouchable but for it to claim exemption from paying not only income tax but also value added taxes is not only interesting but also intriguing

5128069 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5128070 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5128071 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5128072 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

5128106 while environmental defense fund has done great work in cutting carbon dioxide emissions at the plant by as much as 50 percent its not enough to assure viability of our climate

5128297 the final documentation is being prepared by our legal team
5128298 were in the final process and we should have it resolved within 24 or 48 hours
5128299 once the settlement is resolved and we know its all done well be the first to come out with a statement
5128300 were going to go in with hopes of being offensively balanced but not overly predictable
5128301 defensively we hope to be able to force them to turn the ball over and put points on board weve been very lucky to beat them the last two years
5128302 they can run a typical wing t or they could come out with no backs and pass all over us it makes it a little bit harder to prepare because we dont know which of those offenses theyll feature defensively they have always given us a lot of multiple fronts they could run the 4 4 or 4 3 time to time weve just got to be able to figure out which one theyre giving us at the time it forces our offensive line to adjust their blocking
5128303 we looked at film from last year and most things last year arent a big part of the offense this year its the same with them watching us theyre going to try to pound the football at first and if were able to take that away then theyll get into the spread stuff
5128304 id much prefer to never start a sophomore but so far it hasnt been an issue
5128305 we have enough people to make things happen with the ball but it has to happen during the game talking about it on paper is one thing and doing it on the field is another
5128306 its a big step in the right direction if you can win the opener
5128307 if you cant then it doesnt completely ruin your season i dont want to put that much pressure on them
5128308 were fortunate to come through our scrimmages without any injuries and we were able to move the football in both of them we were able to prevent the opponent from doing the same in the game portion of that but one half is not a good judge of how game might turn out
5128309 there were areas in the inner cities where violence has forced individuals within a 30 square feet radius to remain there for years they cannot go up the lane down the lane or anywhere else because of violence the end result is this heart breaking situation
5128310 the males have never left it their communities to find a girl so they prey on each other it is an unending web and sometimes we read about this happening elsewhere and think it cannot happen here
5128311 there are cases where mothers have turned to their sons because their husbands or spouses are in prison and they go to her sons to fulfil her sexual needs
5128312 i am aware of it we have never had a case to deal with it at fathers inc but there are at least four communities where there are just too many instances of this happening
5128313 i have come across situations where during the investigation of a crime you find everybody with the same surname in one instance i interviewed 30 persons and they all have the same surnames
5128314 they were brothers sisters cousins and friends it got to a point where you say wait a minute what is happening here only to retrace your steps to find that they are all family in the sickest kind of ways
5128315 they are the product of the same lineage and this cannot be good for any country and any community can you just imagine the maladjustments of this generation of young people
5128316 this is well known we know this already i work in an inner city community and this is something i know very well
5128317 the police face a dilemma oftentimes we do not have a case there are no complainants to a crime there are those who will say the police have a responsibility to act yes we do but when you have unwilling relatives parents included who will deny it what do you do
5128318 that is so common there are so many stories and actual cases i had to insist to a don that i do not want to be in his company if he was going to be having sex with underaged girls

5128320 if the residents were not willing to report murders it was unlikely that they were going to report incest

5128334 lord there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty help us o lord for we rely on you

5128336 the holocaust was the murder of six million jews including two million children holocaust denial is a second murder of those same six million first their lives were extinguished then their deaths a person who denies the holocaust becomes part of the crime of the holocaust itself
5128337 the policy pursued by the german government resulted in the killing of six million jews of which four million were killed in the extermination institutions
5128338 in some instances attempts were made to utilize the fat from the bodies of the victims in the commercial manufacture of soap
5128339 historians have concluded that soap was not made from human fat when so many people deny the holocaust ever happened why give them something to use against the truth
5128340 the public still repeats time after time the silly story that at wannsee the extermination of the jews was arrived at
5128341 little of what was said there was executed in detail
5128342 in the new edition all references in the text to a hitler decision or hitler order for the final solution have been systematically excised buried at the bottom of a single footnote stands the solitary reference chronology and circumstances point to a hitler decision before the summer ended in the new edition decisions were not made and orders were not given
5128343 from 1942 to 1945 certainly at auschwitz but probably overall more jews were killed by so called natural causes than by unnatural ones
5128344 four million people suffered and died here at the hands of the nazi murderers between the years 1940 and 1945
5128345 many questions remain open all in all how many bodies were cremated in auschwitz how many died there all told what was the national religious and ethnic breakdown in this commonwealth of victims how many of them were condemned to die a natural death and how many were deliberately slaughtered and what was the proportion of jews among those murdered in cold blood among these gassed we have simply no answers to these questions at this time
5128346 sources for the study of the gas chambers are at once rare and unreliable
5128347 most of what is known is based on the depositions of nazi officials and executioners at postwar trials and on the memory of survivors and bystanders this testimony must be screened carefully since it can be influenced by subjective factors of great complexity
5128348 excavations at the killing sites and in their immediate environs
5128349 for chemical technical reasons the claimed mass gassings with hydrocyanic acid in the alleged gas chambers in auschwitz did not take place the supposed facilities for mass killing in auschwitz and birkenau were not suitable for this purpose

5128375 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest
5128376 whoever wants to become great among you must serve the rest of you like a servant whoever wants to become first among you must serve the rest of you like a slave in the same way the son of man did not come to be served he came to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many people

5128380 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5128381 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5128382 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5128383 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5128384 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5128385 the unsupported assumption catastrophic global warming follows burning fossil fuels requires immediate action
5128386 the unsupported assumption that the world is more than 6000 years old
5128387 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change
5128388 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5128389 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
5128390 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

5128393 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5128394 every time i use the iphone app store a little piece of my soul dies
5128395 is it on wow interesting stuff i wonder who and what really designed and pulled this off
5128396 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
5128397 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
5128398 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
5128399 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
5128400 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
5128401 something thats been on my mind for quite a long time
5128402 in some parts of the community there are some frustrations about the investigative process
5128403 turn st petersburg into an enclave for wealthy white people
5128404 people need to wait for the facts to come in and for the investigation
5128405 this particular one with dawson is still open and were asking people to remain calm
5128406 bernie mccabe you cant hide we charge you with homicide
5128407 have you been to detroit i pray the car doesnt break down i cringe when i drive down gratiot im worried for my life theres a lot of bad people in detroit
5128408 not only is it outrageous but i would challenge the fact that theyre causing citizens to become entrapped in committing federal crimes we now have a city that legislates to home depot or whatever home building company wants to build that they actually harbor and shelter illegal aliens aiding and abet them to stay here and to help find them employment
5128409 we can just see how outrageous the open borders side has gotten
5128410 the current draft ordinance leaves many unanswered questions that should be addressed
5128411 a mans own folly ruins his life yet his heart rages against the lord
5128412 selfishness which does make us unattractive never gets the blame or if it does we think of it as something that needs to be corrected rather than forgiven all this is nothing more than a hell inspired set up to depend on a works salvation heres something to do and if you do it well enough youll find life
5128413 charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting but a woman who fears the lord is to be praised
5128414 as water reflects a face a heart reflects a man
5128415 does not he who weighs the heart perceive it does not he who guards your life know it will he not repay each person according to what he has done
5128416 what you went to the bathroom where when what bathroom
5128417 big picture instructional technology models for planning piloting promoting and partnering
5128418 if its wrong to tie the baby to the dog then i dont wanna be right
5128419 all the findings are based in disassembling the binaries with the whole symbol table interpreting the results and trying out with the bits
5128420 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5128421 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5128422 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5128423 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5128424 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5128425 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5128426 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5128427 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5128428 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5128429 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5128430 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5128431 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5128432 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5128433 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5128434 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5128435 the turnout saturday gave the tournament the feel of a big league event after a decade of declining attendance at forest oaks country club the tournament left sedgefield for forest oaks in 1977 and stayed through last year
5128436 weve been doing this for four years handing out pairing guides said former greensboro jaycees president randy harris standing at the tournament entrance to greet arriving spectators
5128437 we have never seen crowds like this at one time it was shoulder to shoulder we have even worked up a sweat for the first time
5128438 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5128439 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5128440 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5128441 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5128442 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5128443 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5128444 porque me daba un error al crear la base de datos no se si seria un fallito pero con eso se me ha solucionado
5128445 we do not know what they were intended for we are merely stating a fact
5128446 no you people are too stupid youre just country hicks you dont know what youre doing
5128447 as a woman a mother a former teacher and an elected official i find this material completely unacceptable
5128448 i can tell you its not playing comfortably in st paul and i cant imagine this politically radioactive material is doing very well in suburban and rural districts
5128449 have a seat and tell me where you know me from please
5128450 so you know me yet i dont know or remember you who are you
5128451 my name is keely as if you didnt know jeez
5128452 well keely are you the one and same i knew fifteen years ago
5128453 for centuries russia has played a highly positive stabilizing role in the region being a guarantor of cooperation and progress things have always been and are going to remain that way nobody should have any doubts about this
5128454 why do you call me lord lord and do not the things which i say
5128455 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
5128456 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
5128457 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
5128458 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
5128459 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5128460 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5128461 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5128462 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5128463 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5128464 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5128465 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5128466 self maybe this is gods way of saying you need a change and that even though you have spent your life working toward the dream of being a teacher maybe you were wrong all along
5128467 why you have an opening in day treatment you want to hire me for
5128468 you know what mark in 7th and 8th grade day treatment just gave his notice because he decided to start a business you should call julie
5128469 somos bons em dizer que jesus veio para salvar a todos mas temos a l ngua afiada para julgar e apontar os erros dos outros dizendo
5128470 n s estamos muito mais interessados em estar certos do que mesmo no evangelho de jesus cristo
5128471 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5128472 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5128473 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5128474 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5128475 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5128476 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5128477 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5128478 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5128479 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5128480 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
5128481 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5128482 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5128483 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5128484 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5128485 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5128486 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5128487 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5128488 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5128489 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5128490 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5128491 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5128492 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5128493 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5128494 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5128495 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5128496 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5128497 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5128498 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5128499 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5128500 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5128501 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5128502 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5128503 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5128504 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5128505 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5128506 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5128507 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5128508 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5128509 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5128510 this is a planning took where all things are going
5128511 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5128512 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5128513 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5128514 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5128515 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5128516 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5128517 above all else guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life
5128518 we dont need jesus to know those three things we need to be broken over what is ungodly in our lives
5128519 the wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to their ways
5128520 youre right i need to do better mom ill try harder
5128521 people are so apt to drift along on the surface of their lives not really seeing or hearing or feeling very much because most of the time they are little more than half alive the rest of the time they are dazed dreaming or detached most of us escape so much by being less than fully alive but jesus seems to escape nothing the dead sparrow the woman touching the hem of his robe the disciples shooing away the children the sawed off little crook named zaccheus up in a tree
5128522 the right direction leads not only to peace but to knowledge
5128523 when a man is getting better he understands more and more the evil that is left within him
5128524 when a man is getting worse he understands his own badness less and less
5128525 people often think of christian morality as a kind of bargain in which god says if you keep a lot of rules ill reward you
5128526 los 4 acuerdos se impecable con tus palabras servicio en espa ol agosto 10 de 2008
5128527 im not sure that anybody can legitimately say that mccain is conservative
5128528 lippi knows me well but i want to be judged like all the others and deserve call ups there was a lot of disappointment after the euros but the will to continue was never lacking
5128529 the czech game is important because i hope to get the answers from the players i expect
5128530 papadopoulos is a player of similar stature to jan koller and that is why i decided to call him up
5128531 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5128532 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5128533 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5128534 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5128535 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5128536 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5128537 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5128538 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5128539 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5128540 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5128541 youll be in our thoughts and prayers i am very impressed by what youre doing and what youre prepared to do coming from a state that is not often hit by a hurricane im incredibly impressed
5128542 we have assumed that for the first 72 hours we should rely on no one but ourselves because thats how long it takes for help to come
5128543 we hope this storm does not turn into a hurricane but if it does the damage will be minimal
5128544 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5128545 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5128546 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5128547 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5128548 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5128549 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5128550 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5128551 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5128552 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5128553 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5128554 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5128555 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5128556 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5128557 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5128558 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5128559 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5128560 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5128561 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5128562 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5128563 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5128564 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5128565 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5128566 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5128567 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5128568 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight
5128569 im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie
5128570 you know what f dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5128571 angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies
5128572 they give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5128573 being married is not something thats even in our minds
5128574 whats important to me is to have a home that is peaceful and healthy
5128575 it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting
5128576 in 2001 j lo was the biggest of the big and is now the star likely to be found soon on trivial pursuit
5128577 and her album of 2007 called brave without a tinge of irony was dubbed worst of the year with one critic saying too shallow even by
5128578 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5128579 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5128580 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5128581 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5128582 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5128583 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5128584 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5128585 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5128586 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5128587 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5128588 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5128589 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5128590 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5128591 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5128592 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5128593 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5128594 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5128595 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5128596 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5128597 irreverent insightful surely one of the most ambitious documentaries on los angeles ever
5128598 just a handful of utilities doing something big changes the scale of the entire market
5128599 the cost has come down to a point where were comfortable doing it
5128600 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5128601 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about

5128608 obamas shifting stance on space exploration is indicative of his inexperience on issues important to voters
5128609 lets be honest obama is only embracing nasa now because of his political problems in florida
5128610 something that is elemental and a vital part of our space program
5128611 i think weve got to sort out our priorities better in other words we cant do everything
5128612 to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and continue our nations pre eminence in space
5128613 considering obamas shifting positions he cannot be trusted to fully support nasas mission to mars
5128614 the only thing barack obama knows about sending a man to the moon is that its a good applause line
5128615 in the next 10 years we will put a man on the moon
5128616 it is like trying to herd a bunch of damn cats

5128618 this is the most difficult issue we are going to face as an agency
5128619 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5128620 we will publish next year details of the work thats been done where we think the particular threats are where we think there is current defence in place we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option

5128622 jen will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship
5128623 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5128624 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5128625 he tips them off he loves the attention jen didnt want to believe it was happening but it was and she has no tolerance for that
5128626 cobwebs come flying out of mayers wallet when he opens it john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jen would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her
5128627 were talking about a guy who had a car waiting to take him home in new york but he chose to walk so he could talk to the press along the way hell drag this out until theres someone new
5128628 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5128629 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5128630 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5128631 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5128632 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5128633 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5128634 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5128635 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5128636 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5128637 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5128638 to sign any outstanding agreements as a matter of urgency to restore political stability in zimbabwe
5128639 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5128640 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5128641 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5128642 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5128643 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5128644 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5128645 we are waiting for them to come back with the law in english
5128646 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5128647 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5128648 china faces routine criticism for human rights violations and repression of religious freedom
5128649 your faith will be like gold that has been tested in a
5128650 well there is a cease fire and russia is currently not in compliance with that cease fire although they have just this morning announced that their troops will begin to withdraw and withdraw fully and completely back to the lines prior to this conflict tomorrow on monday
5128651 in fact the fact that russian troops are in georgian cities the fact that they are at the port of poti back and forth in that port along the east west highway is simply not acceptable and it has nothing to do obviously with the conflict that began in south ossetia thats why russian troops need to withdraw fully completely back to their aug 6 7 lines
5128652 thats what caused the dam to become overtopped and breached
5128653 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
5128654 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
5128655 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
5128656 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
5128657 they are very demanding as they are often bumpy and the street surface changes when you make a mistake you easily run into barriers anyway valencia will not be a complete street circuit there will be lots of run off areas for safety reasons the fia puts a lot of effort into safety which is good
5128658 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive
5128659 the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style also in terms of the racing line you have to approach this gradually it is very important to walk the track before driving it the first time to get a feeling for the surface and the layout
5128660 in the next 10 years we will put a man on the moon

5128687 you saw two of the best pitchers ever out there randy pitched a great game too he just made one mistake
5128688 they were hitting it pretty well but i got them to hit it right at someone
5128689 i think randy was more focused because he was facing roy randy was pretty dominant and roy was real dominant
5128690 i mean any time that guy puts wood on it its a base hit right now
5128691 you kind of knew after the first two games to see that kind of a performance three times wouldve been a lot to ask for

5128700 war against women the use of rape as a weapon in congos civil war
5128701 you know theyre in deep pain but its not just physical pain its psychological pain that you can see here at the hospital weve seen women whove stopped living
5128702 there are children i think the youngest was three years old
5128703 i think because of the widespread nature of the war because there has been so much violence rape is now on a daily basis rape is the norm
5128704 women get raped in wars all the time how is it different here
5128705 i think whats different in congo is the scale and the systematic nature of it indeed as well the brutality this is not rape because soldiers have got bored and have nothing to do it is a way to ensure that communities accept the power and authority of that particular armed group this is about showing terror this is about using it as a weapon of war
5128706 i was lying on the ground and they gave a flashlight to my younger brother so that he could see them raping me
5128707 they raped me like they were animals one after another when the first one finished they washed me out with water told me to stand up so the next man could rape me
5128708 they wanted him to rape me but he refused and told them i cannot do such a thing i cannot rape my sister so they took out their knives and stabbed him to death in front of me
5128709 i was thinking that they had killed i didnt think i would find them alive
5128710 when a woman is raped its not just her thats raped its the entire community thats destroyed
5128711 when they take a woman to rape her theyll line up the family theyll line up other members of the communities to actually witness that
5128712 they make them watch and so what that means for that particular woman when its all over is that total shame personally to have been witnessed by so many people as shes being violated
5128713 why would somebody do that why would somebody shoot a woman inside
5128714 in the beginning i was asking myself the same question this is a show of force of power its done to destroy the person
5128715 sex is being used to commit evil people flee they become refugees they cant get help they become malnourished and its disease which finishes them off
5128716 the most difficult thing is when there is nothing i can do when i see a 16 year old a pretty 16 year old whos had everything destroyed and i tell her that i have to give her a colostomy bag that is difficult
5128717 the fact is the justice system is on its knees in congo
5128718 i can count on one hand the number of cases that were aware of that have been brought to trial literally here people get away with rape they get away with murder the chances of being arrested are nil
5128719 i named her luck because i went through many hardships
5128720 i could have been killed in the forest but i got my life back i have hope
5128721 in some villages as many as 90 percent of the women have been raped men in the villages are usually unarmed and incapable of fighting back

5128760 having googles brand behind symbian could very well mean game over for mobile linux in the mobile phone market
5128761 barn owl we will nest in any natural or human made cavity that is big enough for our family you can build an animal estate for us on your property like the one above you we have an appetite for the animals that you dont like i was once spotted bringing sixteen mice three gophers a rat and a squirrel to my estate in the span of just 25 minutes
5128762 we see that the 1 3 answer is obtained by following the goal of minimizing expected total inaccuracy while the 1 2 answer is obtained by following the goal of minimizing expected average inaccuracy
5128763 before i was put under anesthesia i asked myself what is probability that i will ever wake up due to heads since it would happen if and only if the coin flipped heads i knew then the odds of that were 1 2 now i have woken just like i knew i would and i still know nothing about the coin toss result the odds of heads must still be 1 2
5128764 wait i know more than that i picked a door at random and walked in if you were cloned i would have found you for sure if you werent i would have had only a 50 chance of finding you since the event that i would find you was twice as likely if the coin landed tails the probability now that the coin did actually land tails is twice that of heads given that i actually did find you that is heads has probability 1 3
5128765 no look at it from my point of view when you randomly picked a room there were only two possibilities for me either you would find me or you wouldnt since you picked at random not only are these possibilities equally likely but the event that you would find me is completely independent of the coin toss hence the conditional probability of heads given that you found me must be the same as i would have assessed it before you came 1 2
5128766 there are three equiprobable cases 1 the coin was heads and i have an option of winning 5 2 the coin was tails this is my first awakening and i have an option of losing 4 3 the coin was tails this is my first awakening and i have an option of losing 4 therefore i reject the bet
5128767 the king decided to play a game he tossed a coin if it came up heads he put the gift of five manors in an envelope and had a representative of your baron summoned to be offered the envelope if it came up tails he put two separate documents each ordering the confiscation of two manors in two separate envelopes and had two representatives of your baron simultaneously and separately summoned each to be offered an envelope
5128768 you are such a representative here is an envelope do you want it
5128769 oh well im tired ill just see her in the morning
5128770 secretly toss a coin and if it comes up heads fly to the 1 daisy field if it is tails go to the 2 daisy field i will jump out and land on a random spot i will then look around me for a daisy pick me up again five minutes later and we will repeat the experiment until i land near a daisy
5128771 you will now be taken from this court and locked in a prison cell meanwhile the trial will continue and we will hear the evidence of the witnesses if we find you not guilty you will be released from prison at 10 p m tomorrow this short sentence will be for your failure to prevent or report the crime but if we find you guilty you will be visited at 10 p m tomorrow by someone who will administer a soporific and 24 hour memory wipe this treatment will repeated until you have passed 100 nights in prison and then you will be released at 10 p m psychologists advise us that this will have a reformatory effect on you
5128772 on the first evening at 10 p m they administer a soporific and a one hour memory wipe on subsequent evenings they administer a soporific and a 25 hour memory wipe
5128773 what is the probability that the coin now shows heads
5128774 what is the probability that tomorrows coin will show heads
5128775 what is the probability that tomorrows coin will say heads
5128776 well i dont remember being wakened so it must be monday this means that the probability of the coin being heads was 1 2
5128777 well i remember being awakened yesterday so today is tuesday and the probability of the coin being heads is 0
5128778 my memorys been erased so i dont know what today is for sure but by such and such an argument the probability is 1 2
5128779 my memorys been erased so i dont know what today is for sure but by such and such an argument the probability is 1 3
5128780 she also knows that each time she wakes within the experiment she will not know what day it is and will not have gained or lost any information
5128781 if i had been told the day i would give the answer 1 3 whatever i was told here i havent been told but should that bother me
5128782 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5128783 if its somewhere else its better i dont know why
5128784 the issue in australia is you can only go so far you have to look at how to sell your product on an international stage
5128785 we had a number of customers in australia all tier two
5128786 we looked at the united states but came to the conclusion that its still difficult to get into and not necessarily the most rewarding
5128787 dont necessarily assume its the pot of gold it appears from the outside the prices arent as good because there is more competition
5128788 theres only one word for the u s market and thats brutal
5128789 but a lot of your competition starts here and if a product is going to make it in the long run with a few exceptions youve got to make it in business here
5128790 im me so who you youre not me youre not me and i know that aint fair but i dont care

5128819 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5128820 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5128821 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5128822 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5128823 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5128824 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5128825 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5128826 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5128827 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5128828 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5128829 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5128830 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5128831 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5128832 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5128833 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5128834 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5128835 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5128836 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5128837 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5128838 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5128839 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5128840 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5128841 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5128842 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5128843 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5128844 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5128845 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5128846 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5128847 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5128848 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5128849 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5128850 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5128851 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5128852 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5128853 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5128854 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5128855 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5128856 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5128857 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5128858 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5128859 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5128860 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5128861 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5128862 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5128863 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5128864 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5128865 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5128866 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5128867 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5128868 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5128869 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5128870 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5128871 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5128872 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5128873 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5128874 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5128875 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5128876 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5128877 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5128878 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5128879 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5128880 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5128881 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5128882 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5128883 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5128884 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

5128889 our hope is that it will be available for the 10th anniversary and the port authority i think is making every attempt to do so
5128890 the plan was too unrealistic in the first place but we will get the memorial built we will get the buildings built but well have to do it safely
5128891 we are working with the port authority to help the agency evaluate the issues affecting projected completion dates for its infrastructure projects which have an impact on the entire schedule
5128892 we are hopeful this process will yield an aggressive yet reliable timetable for rebuilding

5128895 thats where you really hone your survival skills when you find yourself in a more serious situation than you had planned for and still manage to come through i think its very empowering to survive
5128896 i can identify with having to cope with snow that deep
5128897 i remember being in a similar situation with four of us and we could only make three or four metres before we were exhausted
5128898 i remember having three days on a mountain in india it just snowed and snowed
5128899 two of our tents got broken so we all squeezed into the other
5128900 obviously when you have huge amounts of snow its very scary
5128901 you get all that moist air coming across the tasman hitting the backbone of the southern alps
5128902 these situations can come in very quickly when you go into that environment you expect it to be a challenge
5128903 it makes a huge difference having people around because moods tend to swing between different people and you lean on each other so youre not just relying on yourself
5128904 four to six people is a good number theres always going to be a couple of people who are optimistic and that can raise the spirits of the others
5128905 if you have a leader of the expedition its their job to basically keep everyones morale going
5128906 the whole trip we were discussing the guys on everest but its not something we dwelled on
5128907 hypothermia is the biggest danger in that kind of situation you lose heat very quickly
5128908 six bodies together will generate quite a bit of heat
5128909 usually in a survival situation its better to have a mix of men and women because they tend to make a better balance of decisions
5128910 i think if it was all women they would make decisions from a certain viewpoint which is not necessarily good for survival
5128911 if it was all men they would make decisions based on ego
5128912 when you get a mix they tend to balance out the negative aspects of the single sex viewpoint
5128913 all the negative things would have gone through their brains but the most important thing is to choose to live to have a reason for coming back like their kids or ive never been parachuting im going to do that when i get back

5128921 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5128922 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5128923 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5128924 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5128925 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5128926 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5128927 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5128928 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5128929 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5128930 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5128931 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5128932 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5128953 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5128954 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5128955 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5128956 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that

5128966 free trade invites the product of cheaper labor to this market to destroy the domestic product representing our high and better paid labor it destroys our factories or reduces our labor to the level of his foreign markets it increases foreign production but diminishes home production open competition between high paid american labor and poorly paid labor will either drive out of existence american industry or lower american wages either of which is unwise

5129021 there was a substantial loss to the public purse of approximately 2 5 million
5129022 it was like winning the lottery without having to bother to buy a lottery ticket

5129024 i hook up with friends and that and they ask for money or something like that and i always say yes and always go out drinking with them and just waste all my money and stuff
5129025 i havent had a drink for about probably two and a half months and when i do have a small drink now i know when to stop
5129026 i think in the past what we weve tried to do is provide a one size fits all service and weve really realised at mission australia that that doesnt work
5129027 we need to actually look at the individual problems people face and have answers for each of those individual ones
5129028 we will measure all the small individual things which happen to people along the way and then continually measure that over a period of time
5129029 in the past i think probably he would have shied away from accessing some of the services he needed now hes starting to access them
5129030 he is starting to feel comfortable about accessing them and confident about it which means that a whole range of things are improving for him and over time what well see is that he himself will build more self confidence more self esteem from just taking some simple steps and making appointments and going and having appointments fulfilled
5129031 seeing changes in his own life and that confidence then will build to make bigger decisions over time
5129032 while our preferred approach is significantly cheaper than if we were to install desktop computers we have estimated that to implement the national secondary school computer fund in nsw an additional 245 million will be required over four years
5129033 there remains a small risk that the market will not be able to provide a suitable device at this price point which meets the specific warranty and functional requirements
5129034 the department cannot accurately predict the overall breakage and loss rates brought about by the mobility of students and their at times boisterous nature and therefore the department proposes that an allocation be made to cover a 10 per cent per annum replacement rate

5129050 obamas shifting stance on space exploration is indicative of his inexperience on issues important to voters
5129051 lets be honest obama is only embracing nasa now because of his political problems in florida
5129052 something that is elemental and a vital part of our space program
5129053 i think weve got to sort out our priorities better in other words we cant do everything
5129054 to maintain a robust program of human space exploration and continue our nations pre eminence in space
5129055 considering obamas shifting positions he cannot be trusted to fully support nasas mission to mars
5129056 the only thing barack obama knows about sending a man to the moon is that its a good applause line
5129057 handled a snow storm weekend with no problems at all
5129058 we were able to do this so quick because it didnt require any structural configuration changes we run a long wheelbase f 150 down the manufacturing line but instead of installing an 8 foot box we put a 5 5 foot box on instead leaving a space behind the cab for the tough box these trucks will be built at our kansas city missouri plant and shipped to second stage manufacturer decoma in auburn hills michigan decoma uses the existing frame holes to install the tough box where the end of the 8 foot bed would have been attached then they are shipped to dealers
5129059 ford will begin offering the tough box this spring as a 2007 model year option
5129060 its a very cool feature but also very functional in addition to storage on the inside you can also add sliding tool drawers that extend back into the bed you can also install a cap over it and the rest of the bed were trying to offer as much flexibility as possible
5129061 construction companies and professionals turn to ford trucks for rugged reliable and technically advanced vehicles

5129076 i use national cars and the prime minister uses national cars too
5129077 yesterday thursday najib and i in a meeting with the mb discussed the matter and we said that the important thing was that the cabinet had decided the state government should not use the cars for its excos
5129078 i said use the mercedes cars for guests who are visiting
5129079 we abdullah and najib reached a consensus on the matter during the meeting at putra world trade centre on thursday the matter has been solved
5129080 the bottom line is this is the only way to get all these guys in the lineup
5129081 i feel for hank hank is a team player hes been busting his tail the whole time but the shoulder is not allowing him to get out on the field
5129082 chris has been openly positive about the idea of going to third base
5129083 hes making this move for the team i dont think it will affect him negatively
5129084 well evaluate both guys and go from there we are committed to chris being a big part of our club going forward if he shows he can play third base it could be an option for us
5129085 i dont think its realistic for him to play third base again this year
5129086 it is fitting that at one of the most significant events of our generation we have witnessed one of the greatest performances in olympic history michaels record breaking performance during these games will inspire millions of people around the world to reach for their goals and aspire to greatness he is an example of the very best values of the olympic movement and our country

5129088 fords huge success in the 2008 businesscar awards illustrates the brands progress in producing attractive and desirable cars that still make good business sense crowning the mondeo as business car of the year shows how the new models quality and desirability has struck a chord with the business community its a very deserving winner of this prestigious award which is decided by the people using the products for business on a daily basis
5129089 new mondeo gathered a lot of attention when it was launched last year and were delighted with the sales figures fleet customers often put huge demands on their vehicles and as this recognition proves mondeo is more than up to the job
5129090 as well as being spacious refined affordable to buy lease and run the mondeo is also desirable this is a car people can choose with their heart and head and in todays market thats very important
5129091 of course our two mpvs also deserve recognition both s max and galaxy are flexible seven seaters that are great to drive factor in their five star euro ncap safety ratings and its not difficult to identify the reasons behind their popularity
5129092 having googles brand behind symbian could very well mean game over for mobile linux in the mobile phone market
5129093 with a society of career driven and goal oriented individuals it has become increasingly difficult to multi task between family and work many parents and their children find it challenging to incorporate family time into their busy lives and have thus forgotten the importance of togetherness and the strength that comes from family unity faith and spirituality are among the many critical components of strong family relationships and this production raises an awareness to their importance
5129094 hey man we have two extra tickets to the concert you need any

5129096 that really contributed to it being a very successful weekend everyone was very happy
5129097 my favorite directive is this one homework grades should be given only when the grades will raise a student s average not lower it hinojosa says our mission is not to fail kids the district s stance is that students who get bad grades fall behind lose hope of catching up and simply give up the district s solution in short don t give students bad grades this is worse than absurd
5129098 i appeal to you that after your armed forces leave georgian territory to start serious thinking and discussions about further negotiations a further search for ways to conduct relations in order not to sow discord between our countries for good
5129099 lets not sow discord for future generations i dont appeal to your mercy but i appeal to your pragmatism and simple common sense i think the time to make the right decisions has come
5129100 the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces or people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
5129101 for them the hardliners the strategic aim of the invasion was not achieved so it was a defeat this creates problems in moscow

5129108 these results show its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
5129109 its not often you see studies where they have managed to improve function in this way
5129110 what they seem to have managed is to maintain the mice at this young stage and both restore and maintain normal activity
5129111 as we age we have an increase in protein misfolding and general faults in protein processing so the ability to maintain an effective system to clear these would be beneficial
5129112 however a direct line to the clearance of defective proteins in the brain is not so clear from this research

5129130 hay una serie de convenios internacionales que son los que dan marco a este tipo de acuerdos y acuerdos bilaterales hoy d a de hecho tenemos algunos acuerdos bilaterales que la verdad como no tenemos nada que ofrecer somos un actor absolutamente pasivo en estas redes internacionales vamos a pasar de ser un actor pasivo a un actor muy activo un actor que puede firmar convenios y tener informaci n que ofrecer y obtener por lo tanto intercambios y esto se hace en mbitos reitero multilaterales o en mbitos bilaterales

5129132 if were talking about not paying their utility bills then the utilities will be cut off if theyre not taking their medications they can become very sick and end up in the e r
5129133 they know what thats like and they live through that so those kinds of fears could create other kinds of problems
5129134 they are not going to come out and say i need help so whats really important for our community is for family members neighbors friends people you go to church with just to heed changes in the loved one
5129135 we want to be ready to act once that happens we intend to formalise our ideas and conduct some pre feasibility studies to at least indicate whether the projects would be commercially and practically viable
5129136 you cant make decisions on viability without having the land sorted out in the first place its exciting as its the first step in what we hope will be a significantly beneficial project for our region
5129137 the company has a reasonable capacity to raise funds at present we have no debt and we believe if its a good viable scheme funding it wont be a problem there will be a number of people happy to partner with us
5129138 were owned by local consumers its fair to say we believe it is the right thing for locals
5129139 the government has been strongly stressing the need for renewable energy the last winter has shown us we have a problem
5129140 we sort of see solar energy to be a little bit like where we saw fibre optic cable and broadband in 1998
5129141 the big advantage with solar energy is youre not nearly so restricted location wise the main requirement is to be close to a substation or transmission lines
5129142 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5129143 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5129144 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5129145 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5129146 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5129147 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5129148 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5129150 since the institute refused to pay back his fees ateet approached the cdrf in 2007 asking for a refund along with an interest at 18 per annum rs 25 000 towards compensation and rs 7 500 as the cost of filing a complaint
5129151 we are once again overwhelmed by the reaction to homebake and do announce that homebake 08 peace in the park has completely sold out in record time organisers said today
5129152 once again we extend our sincerest gratitude to all who have shown their support
5129153 with such intense and surprising reaction we can at least proudly proclaim that the local music industry is well and truly in a healthy shape
5129154 i am not speaking for my party i am speaking for myself as an individual i do support anwar ibrahim in this by election i am not actually supporting him too much as an individual but more on the movement that he leads i feel if anwar is elected to parliament the voices of the opposition will be stronger and the chances of strengthening the democracy and widening the democratic space will be better for these reason i support him
5129155 some whose private lives have been under public scrutiny for a long time clearly told me to watch out for certain withdrawal signs
5129156 the government has squandered an opportunity to deal with cumulative impacts that were understood eight to ten years ago
5129157 the message that was coming from the alberta cabinet in particular was rapid development
5129158 it s no secret that the association had some problems but there s been a fair bit done in the last few months to improve on those problems
5129159 i m just disappointed that pembina would leave instead of helping from the inside
5129160 a lot of work has been done to explore different options and gather scientific input
5129161 there s really nothing stopping the government from doing that
5129162 there were four men and a large herd of cattle when the attack happened
5129163 he was not alone and he was in open space when the tiger attacked
5129164 we never thought that a tiger could attack in the open
5129165 he was in the open field plucking beans his mother was close by with just a bush between them when the attack happened
5129166 what i dont understand is why a woman would risk her life for rs 45 worth of firewood instead of getting work under nrega where she will be paid a better wage have better working hours cr che facilities and so on
5129167 this guard warned a woman who was entering a forest area that a tiger was around he even showed her a pugmark but she merely wiped the pugmark off with her foot and walked right in
5129168 i had to hold many meetings in the villages to warn people about the tiger threat but they simply do not take it seriously once a death happens people are cautious for a fortnight and then things are back to square one
5129169 we have lived in forests and coexisted with tigers for generations together
5129170 we have always gone into forests for firewood grazing and ntfp but tiger attacks have started only in the last few years
5129171 we had to bring all this home and we are now surviving on casual labour
5129172 every family used to earn around rs 3 000 to 4 000 annually from the sale of mahua but this year we do not have mahua even for consumption at home
5129173 we and our cattle cant survive at all if we stop grazing and collecting fuelwood the cost of kerosene and market fodder are beyond our reach
5129174 the forest department officials are always telling us not to go into forests
5129175 but if they take away our agricultural and grazing lands what option do we have but to go into forests
5129176 they are planting trees in straight rows so that you can see right down the entire length of a row tigers need dense and irregular natural forests they cant hide in beats
5129177 plantation work is routine and does not harm the forest cover irrigation projects do not damage the forest as much as insidious factors like growth in population and number of cattle heads causing grazing in forest areas to go up
5129178 screw it i dont want to buy two and the face is more important right
5129179 globalization cannot continue without regulations which govern it the international financial system cannot continue operating in an unregulated way and without adequate supervision free trade is insufficient if it is not at the same time fair trade
5129180 nevertheless on assuming office in january 1933 franklin delano roosevelt observed that to overcome the crisis the first thing required is courage and fortitude and therefore the only thing that should be feared is fear itself
5129181 will require the application of a set of measures which reorients the course of humanity for years to come
5129182 what cannot be comprehended or accepted is the manipulation by some media carried out on a planetary scale with deliberate intent and as an accomplice in hiding from the world the role of speculation in the abrupt rise in the price of fuels on international markets
5129183 speculation operates in a simple way on the futures markets someone sells oil which they do not have another buys oil that they do not expect to receive with the strange consequence that they both make money
5129184 because of this modality of casino capitalism stock markets which operate with futures contracts have become gigantic and uncontrollable betting saloons whose activities affect the prices of the products of the real economy
5129185 the world cannot continue this way it cannot continue to be based upon greed egoism avarice and fraud to amass great fortunes for the benefit of a few the world must change

5129190 theres a lot of potential for bulk wine because of the bulk harvest
5129191 we are a small producer of sauvignon blanc and our growers grow quality grapes we just hope that other people will make quality sauvignon blanc as well
5129192 there is some branding opportunities in it for marlborough as a region if the wine is branded as a marlborough label
5129193 it happens all over the world in places like champagne and other famous wine regions they have been selling wines on the bulk market for generations and it hasnt hurt their reputation
5129194 there was a lot of debate in the early 1990s that bulk would be bad for the industry but evidence to date is sales of those products has not damaged the reputation of the industry
5129195 we didnt have church yesterday and weve never not had church
5129196 much of the line in this area crosses hill country that is difficult to access and there are many poles to replace an iroquois helicopter from the north island is being brought down to fly poles in to the area
5129197 its a matter of being prepared we all looked after each other
5129198 be prepared for some of the most awesome conditions you will ever have experienced at rainbow when we re open it may pay to start planning your sickie now
5129199 its amazing walking around but its quite sad because you can hear all the beech trees cracking
5129200 we cant clear them until snow melt which wont be till the end of the week at least
5129201 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements
5129202 suppressing those movements means a lot to people with huntingtons disease
5129203 for the first time there is a treatment that can help patients with this disease gain some quality of life
5129204 now may the god of peace himself sanctify you completely and may your whole spirit soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ
5129205 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living being nephesh soul
5129206 and now it appears that people taking antidepressants who also have relatively higher depression scores fare significantly worse when attempting to perform a computerized simulation of driving
5129207 and i wouldnt want to instill fear in drivers but i think that perhaps individuals who are taking these medications should just be aware of the fact that they may cause concentration problems and impair reaction time
5129208 this issue is not just a question for drivers because the cognitive skills needed for driving are also needed for a lot of other skills
5129209 there is already a very deep literature about subtle impairments of higher cognitive function associated with clinical depression itself apart from medications
5129210 i would add that in any case medication package inserts routinely warn patients about a whole host of issues when starting a course of psychotropic drugs including warning against the handling of machinery driving or engaging in any occupation in which you can be injured so to that extent this concern isnt new
5129211 i have come on this pilgrimage for two days to say thank you for giving india its leader who led us to freedom
5129212 not in my best of dreams could i have imagined this
5129213 its very special just to compete here you get this chance only once in four years and ive had an incredible experience with all my countrymen i won here for my country i dont now if i can compare them the grand slams and the olympic games the grand slams are important for a tennis player but for a sportsman i think the olympics are important
5129214 the guy who has the record stuck 2 008 needles on his body
5129215 every human being on this earth is born with a tragedy and it isnt original sin hes born with the tragedy that he has to grow up a lot of people dont have the courage to do it
5129216 i did this for a living its what motivated me to go to college
5129217 why not the winner is exactly the age i will be then and there is no reason why i cant go on to london and maybe just maybe get that medal
5129218 my calf was just so bad i had to stretch it the pain felt like it was coming up from my foot early in the race i had this weird feeling that someone was kicking my foot away while i was running
5129219 i would have walked because it was something that was actually okay walking i havent made the injury worse
5129220 if i felt i was doing some serious damage i would have stopped its horrible when you have to drop out especially when its the olympic games so many people have worked so hard to get me here
5129221 in some ways its almost quicker to keep going because if you stop youre just left out there on your own
5129222 they couldnt have been better conditions when i started to struggle i got a lot of traffic and that was annoying i was getting lots of fumes as well as everything else
5129223 a pain came up into my calves it wasnt a sharp pain if it had been like when the stress fracture was bad i would just have stopped i felt like i was just running on one leg
5129224 man it would be nice if i had a quick easy unit testing environment to test stuff out as i write this
5129225 users are advised to observe closed and other warning signs it is important to proceed with care in other areas
5129226 there continues to be debris along the taylor river system there are sections of slumping and areas of loose edges that can give way at any time
5129227 ive been in politics for 20 years and for 20 years ive had barbra streisand trying to do my job so i decided to try my hand at her job
5129228 rick warren is taking a fling at my job so i thought id try my hand at his
5129229 in our materialism were losing the distinction between money power and celebrity as compared with knowledge and wisdom
5129230 thats when it becomes a struggle out there at the moment they are either not milking or getting to sheds where families have got generators working
5129231 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5129232 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5129233 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5129234 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5129235 sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5129236 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5129237 instead of all the high falutin exhortation about listening to the better angels mr obama has gotta come out here and time is short and emphasise social justice
5129238 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5129239 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5129240 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5129241 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts
5129242 but god loves them queers every bit that he loves the republicans
5129243 its their mouth they can use it to haul coal if they want to
5129244 the gallant kids from around here who lost their lives
5129245 it is the same exact people its the same f ing bunch of fight sing drink pray people who are over there who are over here in these mountains
5129246 youre damn right theyre on hadrians side of the wall is where they are and they want the scots irish vote well its true its f ing genes its who we are as a people well say f you to bush longshanks or maggie thatcher f any of em
5129247 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5129248 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5129249 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5129250 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5129251 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5129252 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5129253 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5129254 dinner pail was a communication of the time meaning lunch box when dinner was lunch time supper was the evening meal
5129255 many of us grew up when tv guide and the sunday newspaper tv book were king filled with listings stories photos puzzles and special features with televisions popularity who could have imagined their demise
5129256 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5129257 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5129258 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5129259 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5129260 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5129261 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5129262 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5129263 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5129264 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5129265 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5129266 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5129267 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5129268 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5129269 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5129270 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5129271 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5129272 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5129273 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5129274 a lot of companies turn to youtube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy climate change or poverty now socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved
5129275 its the companys opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers
5129276 they strengthen their brand by putting a face to things customers can hear and see them talk
5129277 the earthkeeper channel on youtube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change
5129278 the reason we chose to sponsor a contest on youtube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative stimulating methods of communicating their messages
5129279 companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible but they want to sell their products at the same time
5129280 youtube is a new vehicle and companies are offering these types of media therefore the spots are not completely altruistic theres an element of both selling and doing good
5129281 he not only indicated the problem of climate change but he also set a new form of demonstration short clips brief presentations
5129282 no company can ignore the whole climate problem i have no doubt that the pr department of every company is telling their bosses we have to have a presence because its part of being in business today
5129283 four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
5129284 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5129285 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue its immoral to keep kicking the can down the road for younger generations to grapple
5129286 if this helps anyone out there who is in their middle aged years and has put off what they wanted to do because they thought they were too old or because they have a child and that they cant balance what they want to do with being a parent then thats great what ive done is show them that they can do it
5129287 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long
5129288 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
5129289 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
5129290 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
5129291 on august 21 there will be a national premier of the film in 400 theaters across the nation the film purports to be an entertaining analysis of the serious financial situation facing america regarding its national debt and fiscal irresponsibility
5129292 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
5129293 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen
5129294 heres what we wont be hearing from these esteemed gentlemen
5129295 poor david rockefeller his grandfather senator nelson aldrich created this monstrosity the federal reserve thats responsible for all that we saw in the film and now the ignorant masses will be coming after him in a blind fit of revenge theyll be coming after all of us like they did the aristocrats in france were closing down the harold pratt house in new york and moving the cfr headquarters to a secure bunker in virginia
5129296 you know i should have earned less and listened more to my dad the heroic
5129297 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5129298 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5129299 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5129300 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
5129301 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
5129302 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
5129303 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
5129304 fail to act and whats been accomplished will be lost
5129305 there are incredible amounts of land on mission that are being unutilized
5129306 i ask people when its the busiest time of the year
5129307 you try to get them at the busiest time to make it parking numbers as accurate as possible
5129308 i see people with bikes and walking their dogs all the time in the cold
5129309 i give lectures sometimes in the iet building and i have to walk all the way to the bakery for coffee
5129310 we can have the best plans in the world but theyre no good if nobody wants to build them
5129311 in my last post i noted how for years children across africa have conspired to chant
5129312 i do not know of any braver act than to accept death
5129313 he sheean went back and strapped himself to his oerlikon gun and tried to keep japanese aircraft away from his mates in the sea and he knew he was going to die
5129314 i was very proud to be a part of the celebrations and to be onboard when the queens representative the governor general of australia michael jeffery visited the ship later in the week
5129315 i enjoy the diversity of work that the navy has to offer and i really enjoy the experience ive had at sea
5129316 ill try to use some of my powers of persuasion to sell lots of jewelery and giftware
5129317 ive had great fun with the program in recent years selling coffee and newspapers so i see this as another challenge
5129318 this is a terrific way to keep in touch with some of the issues facing small business owners in the community and i always enjoy the opportunity given to me by the armidale chamber of commerce and the nsw business chamber
5129319 hes been fantastic hes been serving tea and coffee welcoming customers and directing traffic
5129320 i think the concept of politicians out there meeting the public is a great idea its a good opportunity for locals to meet politicians and voice any concerns they might have
5129321 ive had a flood of people come in there were people waiting for me when i arrived and they werent all jewelery related questions
5129322 in doing this i wanted to acknowledge the wonderful service the henesseys give to their customers it reminds me of growing up with my mum and dad who told me the customer is always right
5129323 its great to help and get involved in the business community ive always supported the idea of politicians going in to businesses its a part of public life and its important to keep in touch with the community

5129334 t he nomination of the first african american presidential nominee after a bitter primary campaign and his efforts to unite a party afterward
5129335 worryingly lehman said that many of the british mortgage related assets on its books had become virtually impossible to value this is in marked contrast with its first quarter when the assets had been fairly easy to value according to erin callan lehmans then chief financial officer
5129336 sadly ians son tom was killed in an avalanche in the snowy mountains on sunday afternoon
5129337 the rooms will be closed for a few days but please keep in touch and think of ian
5129338 the snow and the ice slid out from underneath him
5129339 he was seen to attempt to ride the snow and stay above the surface however at some stage he has been engulfed by the large amount of snow and ice
5129340 we police were aware at that stage that a person had been engulfed by the snow and that a search had taken place by witnesses to no avail
5129341 people do need to be aware that the cornices in the high country can become unstable after a period of warmer weather
5129342 i didnt know the fellow personally but members of staff here did mr thew said
5129343 he has a young family and its devastating for the local community
5129344 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
5129345 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
5129346 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
5129347 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
5129348 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
5129349 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
5129350 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5129351 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5129352 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5129353 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5129354 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5129355 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5129356 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5129357 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5129358 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5129359 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5129360 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5129361 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5129362 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5129363 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5129364 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5129365 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5129366 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5129367 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5129368 if its a poor choice you spend the next 60 days worrying about the other plane
5129369 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5129370 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5129371 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5129372 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5129373 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5129374 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5129375 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him
5129376 you could put baracks head on johns body and say hes gained a little weight but you wouldnt notice he was in different clothes
5129377 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5129378 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5129379 people try to put us down just because we get around
5129380 the further down the street you went the badder it got
5129381 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5129382 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
5129383 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5129384 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5129385 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5129386 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5129387 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5129388 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
5129389 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
5129390 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
5129391 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
5129392 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
5129393 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
5129394 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
5129395 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
5129396 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
5129397 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
5129398 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
5129399 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
5129400 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
5129401 that weve got to fundamentally change not only our policies but how our politics works how business is done in washington
5129402 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5129403 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5129404 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5129405 ive taken the action because someone had to this government is trying to force this on the people and someone had to stand up and say that there is no evidence to support it
5129406 on the face of it this applicant would seem to face some insurmountable obstacles in bringing this action
5129407 i want to win if i lose what a tragedy to think about that 2 billion plus that our country will give for no return each year im not going to let that happen without attempting to stop it
5129408 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5129409 you have finally been blessed this is your time to shine
5129410 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5129411 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5129412 if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5129413 i hate to disappoint you but nothing to report today
5129414 i dont have anything for you on the vice presidential front
5129415 i would like to congratulate these dedicated and hard working executives on their well deserved promotions which reflect the achievements and contributions they have each made to the overall success of the company ed sandra zina kara and jennifer are all extremely qualified and respected executives and are poised to seamlessly step into the roles they are about to fill
5129416 with these appointments the board is recognizing the great depth of talent at the company and further advancing our strategic development process currently underway to capitalize on future growth opportunities and enhance shareholder value
5129417 with the influx of devices such as the iphone with gps entering the market nokia nyse

5129426 n o tenho essa confirma o e n o dei essa confirma o para ningu m acho imposs vel fazer isso
5129427 em poucas horas ou mesmo em alguns meses ele n o conseguiria quebrar a senha criptografada precisaria de um parque computacional com uma capacidade extremamente grande pra quebrar a senha criptografada e ter acesso ao sistema ent o eu considero praticamente imposs vel a fraude em uma elei o
5129428 sempre tem aqueles aproveitadores de plant o que quando ocorre alguma coisa deste tipo eles tentam vender servi os que s o imposs veis de serem realizados
5129429 stood in front of the train waiting for it to hit him johnson said

5129441 un choc entre le moyen ge et le 21e si cle
5129442 we threw a lot of fastballs that caught way too much of the plate today
5129443 it was just balls up and we were just missing
5129444 look at it when oki hideki okajima was out there he wasnt giving up shots they were hitting balls right next to the third base line and hitting the wall its not like it was overpowering
5129445 we were watching some guys and they were setting up hitters real good and theyd come back with a pretty decent pitch and theyd hit it its not like they crushed us
5129446 some balls went off the wall but its not like they were flying off that wall like it was going to kill somebody
5129447 when you get a double off that wall it means you hit it in the right spot and it stayed up in the air hit it too hard and its a single
5129448 its not that they were killing the ball they were hitting it in spots where we werent
5129449 you dont want to lose games the way we lost today basically youre losing before you ever get your first at bat its unfortunate all the blame should go to one person and the right person got the blame today
5129450 where are the new big ideas of the republican party that john mccain is is championing
5129451 there is no doubt that this has been an enormous fall from grace for a man that lived 61 years in an exemplary fashion judge sexton said
5129452 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5129453 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5129454 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5129455 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5129456 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5129457 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5129458 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5129459 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5129460 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5129461 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5129462 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5129463 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
5129464 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
5129465 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
5129466 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
5129467 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
5129468 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
5129469 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
5129470 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
5129471 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
5129472 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
5129473 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
5129474 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5129475 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5129476 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5129477 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5129478 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5129479 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5129480 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5129481 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5129482 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
5129483 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
5129484 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
5129485 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
5129486 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
5129487 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
5129488 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
5129489 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
5129490 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
5129491 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
5129492 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
5129493 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
5129494 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5129495 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
5129496 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
5129497 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
5129498 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
5129499 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
5129500 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
5129501 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5129502 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5129503 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5129504 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5129505 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5129506 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5129507 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5129508 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5129509 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5129510 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5129511 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5129512 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5129513 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5129514 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5129515 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5129516 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5129517 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5129518 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5129519 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
5129520 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
5129521 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
5129522 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
5129523 are you a friend of the world or a friend of god
5129524 stood in front of the train waiting for it to hit him johnson said
5129525 he did not make any attempt to get out of the way

5129531 what we used to call before the multicultural age facts
5129532 i carried my nephew in my arms to the hospital he was alive until we reached the hospital and his blood stained my clothes
5129533 what happened is what we feared would happen because this area was the stronghold of al qaeda in adhamiya we killed them we captured them we destroyed them and we expected they would seek revenge
5129534 it appears that on present form the iraqi government probably wont proceed with most of these or all of them
5129535 in our relationship with the north there always exists the possibility of localized conflict so we cannot afford to loosen our readiness
5129536 it is quite nonsensical for the u s to offer a handshake to its dialogue partner while holding a dagger in its other hand
5129537 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5129538 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5129539 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5129540 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5129541 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5129542 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5129543 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5129544 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5129545 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5129546 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5129547 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5129548 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5129549 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5129550 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5129551 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5129552 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5129553 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5129554 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5129555 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5129556 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5129557 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5129558 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5129559 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5129560 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5129561 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5129562 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5129563 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5129564 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5129565 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5129566 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5129567 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5129568 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
5129569 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
5129570 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
5129571 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
5129572 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
5129573 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
5129574 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
5129575 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
5129576 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
5129577 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5129578 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5129579 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5129580 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5129581 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5129582 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5129583 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5129584 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5129585 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5129586 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5129587 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5129588 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5129589 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5129590 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5129591 what specific events in the story of jamestown obviously show gods providence at work
5129592 its such a unique opportunity for the community to get together and each year you find you get to know more and more of your neighbors thats what is nice about the small town appeal of castle rock
5129593 a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
5129594 for many will come in my name claiming i am the christ or messiah and will deceive many
5129595 heavens gate cult who also believed himself to be jesus or some form of re incarnated jesus
5129596 you will hear of wars and rumors of wars but see to it that you are not alarmed such things must happen but the end is still to come
5129597 nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be famines and earthquakes in various places all these are the beginning of birth pains
5129598 then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations because of me
5129599 at that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people
5129600 and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come
5129601 the spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons
5129602 but mark this there will be terrible times in the last days

5129610 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
5129611 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care
5129612 the economic cost estimate to central new york for smoking is 763 million
5129613 individuals and society we can act on what we see in the mirror
5129614 you folks cant sustain that we cant as a community sustain that
5129615 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5129616 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair
5129617 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making

5129632 sesungguhnya orang alim itu kedudukannya seperti orang tua ayah maka apa yang engkau inginkan terhadap ayahmu sampaikanlah kepadaku
5129633 saya adalah seorang pemuda yang tidak mempunyai istri kadang kadang saya takut resiko terhadap diri saya kadang kadang saya melakukan onani mengeluarkan sperma dengan tangan maka apakah yang demikian itu termasuk maksiat pelanggaran
5129634 cis cis kawin dengan perempuan budak itu lebih baik daripada onani namun onani itu lebih baik daripada zina
5129635 onani itu hukumnya haram menurut kebanyakan ulama dan ini adalah salah satu dari dua riwayat imam ahmad bahkan dikatakan yang paling jelas sedangkan menurut satu riwayat dari beliau hukumnya adalah makruh akan tetapi apabila timbul goncangan dalam jiwa yang bersangkutan misalnya ia khawatir terjatuh ke dalam perbuatan zina jika tidak melakukan onani atau khwatir jatuh sakit maka dalam hal ini terdapat dua macam pendapat ulama dalam hal ini beberapa golongan ulama salaf dan khalaf memberikan kemurahan memperbolehkannya sedangkan sebagian lainnya melarangnya
5129636 jika seseorang sengaja melakukan onani yang meskipun keburukannya palng kecil dan mudharatnya paling ringan di antara tiga macam kejelekan tetapi kalau melampui batas maka ia dapat menimbulkan kesedihan dalam hati dan penyakit dalam tubuh dan menjadikan pelakunya yang masih muda tampak menjadi tua gundah dan beringas yang menyebabkan orang lain lari dan takut kepadanya dan dia sendiri takut menghadapi kehidupan dan beban bebannya
5129637 saya tidak menyerukan onani tetapi saya menetapkan hakikat yang ditetapkan oleh banyak dokter ahli dan secara garis besar pendapat ini disetujui oleh banyak dokter ahli dans ecara garis besar pendapat ini disetujui oleh fuqaha fuqaha golongan hanafiyah
5129638 wahai segenap kaum muda barang siapa di antara kalian sudah mempunyai kemampuan maka hendaklah dia menikah karena menikah lebih dapat menundukkan pandangan dan lebih dapat memelihara kemaluan dan barang siapa yang belum mampu maka hendaklah dia berpuasa karena puasa merupakan perisai baginya

5129640 ujar yusuf iman usai resmi mengucap dua kalimah syahadat kini yusuf iman mengisi hari demi hari dengan mendalami islam bersama seorang ustadz yang ditunjuk untuk membinanya
5129641 front pembela islam fpi sebenarnya sudah lama jadi incaran aliansi musuh allah swt yakni kelompok gabungan antara kelompok liberal kelompok maksiat prostitusi perjudian dan pornografi kelompok kuffar dan aparat serta pejabat yang selama ini mendulang uang haram dari perputaran bisnis haram tersebut
5129642 sudah banyak tokoh dan elemen islam yang menyampaikan amar maruf maka kami memang mengkhususkan diri pada nahyi munkar
5129643 media massa hanya mengekspos hal itu tapi tidak memuat apa yang kami lakukan sebelum itu
5129644 jika ada informasi yang menyebutkan di suatu tempat ada lokasi yang tidak beres maka kami biasanya mengirim intelijen kami yang terdiri dari beberapa orang untuk menggali informasi yang valid jika benar itu tempat yang tidak beres maka ada dua pengelompokkan yang fpi lihat jika tempat maksiat itu didukung warga sekitar dalam arti banyak warga sekitar yang mencari nafkah di sana dan menggantungkan hidupnya di sana maka kami kirim ustadz untuk memberi pencerahan ini sisi amar maruf fpi kami mendirikan pengajian dan sebagainya
5129645 namun jika tempat maksiat itu ternyata meresahkan warga sekitar dan banyak yang dilindungi oleh preman terorganisir atau malah ada oknum aparat yang ikut melindungi maka kami biasanya melayangkan surat pemberitahuan kepada pihak kepolisian agar polisi bisa bersifat pro aktif
5129646 kami membantu tugas kepolisian ini patut diberi tekanan karena polisi terlalu sibuk sehingga tempat maksiat tersebut tetap berjalan dengan aman dalam meracuni masyarakat maka laskar kami yang turun selain memberi surat kepada polisi kami pun melayangkan surat pemberitahuan berlapis lapis kepada pengeloal tempat kemaksiatan itu dan biasanya mereka membandel karena menganggap polisi saja tidak berani membereskannya apalagi fpi tapi sekali lagi saya tekankan fpi berjuang untuk menegakkan agama allah jadi kami tidak kenal takut terhadap segala kemaksiatan mereka yang berada di jalan setan saja berani masak kami yang berjaung di jalan allah harus takut
5129647 sisi inilah yang jarang diekspos media massa sehingga masyarakat banyak tahunya kami ini organisasi anarkis
5129648 give me a second i gotta go kill these guys first
5129649 when i saw phillips die i looked down and was bleeding pretty good thats probably the most scared i was at any point
5129650 then i kinda had to calm myself down and be like all right i gotta
5129651 when you ask for volunteers to run across an open field to a reinforced op that almost everybody is injured at and everybody volunteers it feels good there were a lot of guys that made me proud putting themselves and their lives on the line so their buddies could have a chance
5129652 its usually three rpgs some sporadic fire and then theyre gone i dont where they got all those rpgs that was crazy
5129653 it was some of the bravest stuff ive ever seen in my life and i will never see it again because those guys

5129656 perhaps the most important takeaway from that encounter though is the one that the mainstream media couldnt be bothered to pay attention long enough to learn that not for the first time a contingent of american soldiers that was outnumbered by up to a twenty to one ratio soundly and completely repulsed a complex pre planned assault by those dedicated enough to their cause to kill themselves in its pursuit that kind of heroism and against all odds success is and has been a hallmark of americas fighting men and women and it is one that is worthy of all attention we can possibly give it

5129689 following mahmood refats mort aux vaches cd here is another real middle eastern composer tarek atoui he was born in lebanon in 1980 moved to france in 1988 and studied at the conservatory of paris although his work is based in the field of the electro acoustics its all computer based using max msp much of his work is made for theatre there have not been many recordings available but surely this may change after releasing on the ever high profile label staalplaat much of this info i culled from the internet as staalplaat never gives much information so i was a bit surprised by what i heard many beats rolling over each other hardly in a way that would induce any form of dance music and from the rhythms more abstractions are made in the computer high pitched quickly moving some of these beats could pass on a extreme breakcore music hardcore gabber beats but in a non sequential way as to avoid any resemblance to dance music i n the pieces were the beats are down either in tempo or in presence atoui plays music that i think is much more interesting for instance in the final track he plays an interesting piece of music based on what could be middle eastern field recordings and remote electronics i think its the most interesting piece of the cd in other pieces such as the third the nerve and hectic is nice too one could argue that atoui plays some nice form of plunderphonics in a true original form

5129693 this new one comes with a sort of bathroom curtain plastic cover that is partly transparent but also makes a hallucinogenic thing the music is by andrey kiritchenko our man on the laptop and more from the ukraine around when this was recorded i also saw him play a concert and besides a laptop i believe he used an autoharp and a guitar the laptop contains the usual crackles hiss and processed field recordings but kiritchenko plays some rather nice warm ambient glitch music half way somewhere fennesz and microsound not yet really pop like and cut in to one long piece kiritchenko plays rather moody atmospheric music fortunately not too abstract with his ploinks on the guitars or his drones from the autoharp i remember back when attending the concert that kiritchenkos music is quite nice but perhaps better enjoyable at home then in a concert space with people standing around and talking like the one i saw now that it is o n cd i can only applaud the fact yes it works much better another great addition to the series
5129694 machinefabriek means machine factory you might expect a name like that for some einst rzende neubauten like industrial act but here thats not the case okay at some times machinefabrieks music might sound harsh and abrasive but industrial no my music is more about combining distorted raw sounds with subtle melodies and stillness references are tim hecker fennesz tarentel and stars of the lid despite the fact most other mort aux vaches releases are live documents this one is recorded at home before having it played by berry kamer from the vpro on dutch radio this time i decided to limit myself by using mainly the guitar and laptop and a record player on one track i roughly recorded some parts and chopped it up on the computer thats when the compositions came to life its a questioning of listening and the process itself will dictate the way to go i tried to make a pati ent record a record that slowly pulls you in ironically a big influence was the mort aux vaches cd by oren ambarchi for me thats the ultimate statement in guitar and electronics minimalism bathyale means the part of the sea between 200 and 1000 meters where no sunlight comes through i wanted to do something with water cause thats what i kept thinking of when making and listening to the music the pieces have a fluidity but at times they are pretty dark and crackly

5129697 mahmoud refat is from egypt who previously released on leerraum hes not a player of traditional instruments but is a normal artist with sound installations field recordings following a career in funk acid jazz experimental music i must say i had no expectations whatsoever i cant say im disappointed the whole notion that it should be ethnic inspired is of course bullshit it proves that whatever we call microsound for the lack of any better term is much more a global thing that we knew refat plays laptop music using sounds of whatever field nearby or far away but he adds low humming beats think ikeda or noto but on a much more subdued level which work well as a creepy undercurrent for the music the rhythmical notion he puts on makes this perhaps more clicks n cuts for the lack of any better term than plain microsound but the addition of field recordings is certainly a refreshing look on the subject matter meelkop meets noto chartier mee t pan sonic if you catch my fantasy running wild on the subject for me an entirely new artist but certainly someone to watch for the future

5129701 one amp 1 2 years ago meriel barham from leeds released her debut album kids with sticks as kuchen on karaoke kalk with kuchen meets mapstation now follows the second release by meriel former member of the british pale saints though this time as the title reveals its a joint project with stefan schneider from dusseldorf the person behind mapstation and also part of to rococo rot to those who are already familiar with the music of mapstation and kuchen the title will also give away something about what we are about to hear two people two musicians meet each of them bringing with them their very own idea of music and together trying to merge these into a unified whole rather by chance their paths crossed last year there was a liking for each other and for each others music ed martin from leeds had the idea that kuchen and mapstation should do a record together more a kind of remix album at the first step and finally the result is the album at hand which to ok two years to realize it in between this time sometimes they both did work together on the realization and sometimes for themselves until they finished it together in berlin this year its ten tracks reminds one of a long intense and also very personal dialogue a dialogue between two individuals who nevertheless harmonize in their ideas and who seem to like each other even when at variance kuchens sometimes more playful music connects seamlessly with mapstations perhaps more serial sound and yet each ones distinctive qualities remain in the foreground without challenging or levelling the others rarely has the attempt to bring together two different projects been so successful

5129778 if my career were to end now or if my season were to end now id be happy
5129779 its a lot of luck too i have some skills luckily the other two guys had skill it was three skilled guys going into the last corner
5129780 i was to the right of him and i couldnt figure out what had happened and then i saw him looking down trying to catch the pedal back in
5129781 then i swung in on the inside and by that time bahati had momentum on all of us
5129782 i was bouncing from wheel to wheel we would lose each other and meet up again but it wasnt fast enough to just have three guys lined up we all had to fight for position
5129783 when guys chop me and fight for wheels it makes me more excited and i get even more crazy i just do what i have to do to win i try to keep it all fair keep my hands on the handlebars and i go for the win
5129784 hes been one of our strongest fastest guys all year
5129785 there were four teams that had a full team colavita us jelly belly and rock
5129786 were the only guys who raced we attacked everyone else was chasing and riding negatively because they all wanted a sprint the small teams were attacking but when you get three of the four big teams not doing anything but riding negatively it just turns into a goofy race
5129787 with the guys who could set a good tempo on the last lap gone it just made it a lot more chaotic
5129788 it was just battling bars left and right through every turn and getting swarmed and trying to come back it was crazy
5129789 there were a lot of people out there to see me and the race was pretty boring and negative i tried to mix it up im glad i did it it hurt man
5129790 it made other teams react and we could sit back and wait
5129791 i was pretty tentative coming out in all honestly but it was fun it was good training
5129792 a lot of these were like whoo hoo christian vande velde tour de france big deal and then when he hit it you hear some guys talking trash then two laps later were strung out and nobodys talking and christian is gaining ground
5129793 it actually really pisses me off there are a lot of disrespectful guys they need to go to europe and see what its like before they talk
5129794 i went up the left so i could take the inside of the final corner and so pic would have to take the longer line and couldnt take it as well
5129795 she slowed into the corner and i barreled into it i felt pretty confident when i was first out of the corner that i would be first to the line
5129796 im always completely relaxed when im on her wheel because she knows exactly where to go she just weaves in and out of riders i feel like im on a little trailer dragged behind her

5129825 only if the victim did not deserve death based on the sharia and if the victim deserved death the murderer must prove that in court according to set criteria

5129827 they want to frighten her to abandon all human rights related activities or even leave the country

5129875 but i tell girls that i do a lot of things in pearls and pumps you can be a part of this used to be male dominated thing but you can still be feminine you can still be who you are
5129876 i think all of us have kind of an altruist bent for the greater good because we could probably be doing research chemistry or medical and making more money but everybody seems to have a passion for the science and work and wanting to help people
5129877 looking at women actually doing what i thought i wanted to do they seemed to have to make a really difficult choice as to making sure that their career was successful and also being successful moms and they did it and they did it well but it was just a choice that i did not want to make

5129920 the controversy seems to stem from re create 68s refusal to disallow the right to self defense to its members re create 68s explanation of this refusal is clear there will be people protesting with re create 68 arm in arm with their children and elders in large part these will be representatives of communities which have most suffered from the never ending betrayal of the democrats to attempt to deny them the right to defend themselves is to deny a fundamental human right
