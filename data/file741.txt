7410007 north carolina is a big state and its important that kay talk to voters from one end to the other
7410008 the closer you get to november the more the local democratic candidates are going to want to distance themselves
7410009 its indicative of what the conventions have become which is a place where not a lot of substantive business gets done but a place where party activists get to network
7410010 and people of that stature are already plugged into that
7410011 looking forward to campaigning with obama again this fall thats for sure
7410012 and she wants to spend her time getting her message out to as many voters as she can
7410013 it just so happens she had several events scheduled during the week of convention
7410014 i hope the delegates to the convention from north carolina have already made up their mind who theyre voting for governor
7410015 we have this pattern now of finding temples close to the water or under the water in this most recent case

7410018 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters

7410029 neal and i talked about it over and over last winter
7410030 we knew we had to get better in the minor leagues we need talent we need guys who can play baseball
7410031 and unlike minnesota initially weve got some young pieces in place in the major leagues
7410032 and weve influxed some younger talent quicker than with minnesota
7410033 the trying part is we know how close we are
7410034 you want to continue to take those steps some days you wish you could take them quicker but its a great thing to see that extra hungriness in your players to take the next step
7410035 all in all its been a very satisfying season to see the growth in our players to see
7410036 if our starting pitching would have been what we thought it would be but you can flip side that what if our offense hadnt been what its been
7410037 theres frustration that goes into it knowing were a pretty good ball club every once in a while we have trouble getting over the hump its a frustrating time but again its also an exciting time
7410038 we need to continue to work his footwork so hes in a better position to throw its going to take some work he still has a lot of development to go through but the mistakes are correctable you see the pluses and the projections are all good

7410059 alam kong hindi ako madedehado i must be aware that their team up is so popular pero alam kong hindi naman ako basta lalabas lang na kontrabida sa kanila
7410060 sinabihan na ako ng gma 7 na may follow up na ang exposure ko sa joaquin bordado natutuwa sila sa resulta ng telserye at itong susunod na lalabasan ko it will be something different hindi pa puwedeng magsabi ng detalye hanggat wala pang go signal
7410061 marami ngang magagandang nangyayari sa career ko isa na ang project na pagsasamahan namin nina dingdong dantes at marian rivera its going to be a movie na ididirek ni mac alejandre for gma films
7410062 naku hindi naman siguro pero alam kong hindi ako madedehado i must be aware that their team up is so popular pero alam kong hindi naman ako basta lalabas lang na kontrabida sa kanila hindi rin ako basta binibigyan sa ngayon ng contravida role eventually perhaps pero kahit kontrabida wala akong mairereklamo basta may impact at hindi yung magiging kawawa lang ako
7410063 thats not true on that day lang kasi kailangang mag work ako nag taping ako ng
7410064 okey lang sa akin yun hindi naman ako naghahangad na parang isasali pa ako sa birthday concert nina marian at dingdong sa araneta coliseum ano naman ang gagawin ko doon marian and dingdong deserve that and lets give that to them since they are the hottest love team now
7410065 exaggerated ang reaction sa aswang issue pokwang mas grabeng manlait
7410066 well its just a real pain in the butt and i am tired of having to deal with it
7410067 its great that you recognize that bob but more importantly are preparing to do something about it
7410068 i didnt even know it was a tear there was a lot of pain in bangkok and i didnt know what it was i thought it was a problem related to my flat feet but after i returned to mumbai and finished with johns abraham brothers wedding reception i got an mri done it showed a tear
7410069 its a very common occurrence in the legs of active people like dancers and athletes that tear just stays theres no cure for it if you lead a routine life it doesnt bother you at all otherwise theres arthroscopy but my orthopaedic surgeons have not advised it i can walk work out dance do everything
7410070 i didnt want to inconvenience anyone during the shooting so as a precautionary measure i kept a therapist around because during a dance movement there was some swelling none of the dance steps changed dancing is a routine activity so the therapist was just a precautionary measure
7410071 its part of our job its no big deal you just have to understand your body and be careful four years back i ran with the wrong shoes it caused a knee problem i immediately corrected that i believe in long term health and when i work out i listen to my body if any part of my body gives me any pain i stop immediately and no trainer can push me
7410072 whats the point of being nervous its done and gone its not like a stage performance where i can improve on the performance mumbai meri jaan and maan gaye mughal e azam are very different films am i proud of both films im happy with both films i was even proud of a few of my three scenes in shaurya
7410073 i got to do comedy again in maan gaye mughal e azam this is an entirely new genre for me the director sanjay chhel comes from gujarati theatre i play a ghazal singer haldi hassan with a roving eye slightly sleazy and though i sing quite well i left it to the professional playback singers to sing for me im only an actor
7410074 but genres are not relevant i leave it to the pundits to segregate by genre i go by what the script requires from me for me acting is cathartic it gives me a chance to be and do what i wouldnt in real life we actors are a blessed lot acting gives me a chance to recognise myself
7410075 i play an unemployed guy he can apply himself to work but chooses not to and hangs around with younger boys in an irani caf its all very interestingly done
7410076 i used to joke about me being a garlanded photograph in sarkar raj
7410077 i feel this is amitabhs best performance he was the obvious choice for the role
7410078 amitabh suited the role of the ageing theatre actor perfectly i dont think anyone would have fitted the bill so well he is so eccentric performs so brilliantly and the way he speaks english is so impeccable and clear i feel he is the crowning glory of the film
7410079 rituparno ghosh creates magic out of relationship based cinema i dont think anyone would have treated the script the way he has done it
7410080 this film is in english and anyone who understands the language can enjoy it it imparts undertones of various messages and talks in particular of the conflict between theatre and cinema
7410081 i love watching a film like om shanti om but i know there are better people who are making such masala and romantic films now more intelligent and meaningful stories need to be told even mithya was such a film
7410082 the last lear is a niche film and so it was required to be shown internationally before being brought it to india it has already travelled to film festivals in toronto rome and london
7410083 when we thought of releasing the film around the summer vacations this year the ipl indian premier league matches were on and there were also a lot of big films packed till now we wanted to release it at a decent time when there wont be many commercial films to compete with
7410084 i dont hold a grudge against blockbuster filmmakers i only want all kinds of cinema to coexist
7410085 the industry needs a blockbuster like om shanti om to fund my kind of movies
7410086 were still not sure of the impact morality is a serious thing to the malays and saiful did swear on the quran and he did it in a mosque
7410087 saiful also made a mistake on when anwar ibrahim had allegedly inserted his penis into his rectum instead of june 26 saiful said he was sodomised on aug 26 before correcting himself

7410097 as i see it this team is going to get better they are a year older and that little experience will count
7410098 they already have quality and their enthusiasm is undimmed so i have every right to feel confident
7410099 after all this squad came close to winning the treble last season in my view they are the boys the others will have to beat
7410100 football is about winning it doesnt matter how well you play so long as you come off the pitch having picked up the points
7410101 when you dont play as well as you know you can but you are still getting results then that is a sign of a good team
7410102 when we do start playing well were confident well keep getting the points on the board to make sure we are in the mix at the top of the table
7410103 it was nice to play my first competitive game at anfield but at the end of the day the most important thing was to win
7410104 it doesnt matter whether its my first game here or not its about winning and ive settled in well now so the match was all about getting three points on the board and we managed to do that
7410105 it was a frustrating game but they made it hard for us and you have to give credit to middlesbrough a lot of teams are going to come to anfield and make it hard for us and get people behind the ball and thats what they did
7410106 they caught us on the break and it was a good strike from mido but i thought we showed a lot of character to get back into the game thats what top teams do and we showed that desire with the two late goals
7410107 weve got two wins out of two in the league and thats all you can ask for
7410108 now we will look ahead to wednesday game against liege and we know how important it is to make sure we get into the group stages
7410109 i often stare at the people passing by but they cant see me through my window shades its like im not even there

7410130 the newcastle result was disappointing but that has gone were looking at portsmouth and then the super cup
7410131 i think we worked well today and i really enjoyed the game
7410132 seluruh tim bermain dengan baik dan kami mendominasi jalannya pertandingan selama 70 menit namun mereka kemudian mencetak gol dan mendapatkan semangatnya kembali dari itu
7410133 bermain selama 120 menit di awal musim memang tak pernah mudah
7410134 bagaimana saya di bawah kepelatihan mourinho well saya menikmatinya tetapi yang lebih penting lagi adalah untuk memenangi pertandingan
7410135 deco sekali lagi tampil dengan sedikit daya magis saya pikir itulah yang akan membantu kami memenangi liga tahun ini
7410136 laat hen maar want ze weten niet wat ze doen

7410140 keikusertaan saya di piala super italia adalah karena mancini yang membawa inter meraih scudetto jadi ia pantas menerima bagian dari penghargaan ini karena kerja keras yang sudah dilakukannya untuk tim ini

7410142 anyone else think danny ainge is employing some strategy here or working with another nba team to try and sabotage the blazers salary cap flexibility yeah me too
7410143 could boston be angling for a free agent handled by miles agent could another western conference team be encouraging ainge to make this happen to keep the blazers down
7410144 siapapun yang di luar negeri sana menyebut sepakbola italia membosankan well laga ini sudah bisa menjawab kritik tersebut
7410145 di pertandingan ini tercipta empat gol peluang encetak gol yang muncul berkali kali dan juga adu penalti jadi pastinya sepakbola di sini menyajikan banyak drama jika semua tim bemain seperti inter dan roma maka bakal tersaji olahraga yang menarik
7410146 tentu saja kami ingin mendedikasikan kemenangan ini untuknya tapi saya yakin ia akan melihat ke bawah dan bangga dengan cara bermain anak anak malam ini
7410147 performa yang tampak benar benar luar biasa terutama di babak kedua namun bila sudah sampai pada tahap penalti jadinya semua adalah lotere
7410148 we are proud to have aamir working on the ad and happy with the outcome of the final product no other actor could have done the same so effectively

7410224 lucy amp ethel take amandas new bike out for the first time
7410225 we have not had one second of problem as a coaching staff with our team
7410226 weve been joined at the hip for the last three years
7410227 i never expected to be kissed by coach k but that was a great moment
7410228 i want to thank coach k for believing in me and ive told him that
7410229 he was the one who believed in me coming back to this team
7410230 we dont run too many plays we just spread the floor break guys down and share the ball
7410231 because hes like a younger brother i dont know if this was possible
7410232 although there might be a little problem in future after that bobo scene but the feeling was great
7410233 i can see an image of a singer from eun hye
7410234 is eun hye going to come back as a singer
7410235 i hope that she is not going to be the backup vocals for someone but singing her own songs
7410236 they have claimed that taliban were there they must prove it so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7410237 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7410238 i n the tragic air strike and irresponsible and imprecise military operation in azizabad village in shindand district more than 89 of our innocent countrymen including women and children were martyred
7410239 once again the enemies of islam have stained their hands with the blood of innocent people we the muslim nation will not accept their apologies this time
7410240 squarespace is a hosted web service we do not have plans to make a downloadable version partially because our unique hosting architecture is such a strong point of our service to put squarespace on a shared web host would be to ruin it
7410241 why dont you offer 10 000tb of bandwidth for 2 99 because our service is reliable with a shared web host theyre able to offer massive amounts of storage and bandwidth because its literally impossible to use it your site would crash on a shared host if you sent that much data from your site seriously go try it
7410242 the world learned about china and china learned about the world
7410243 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the xxix olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the xxx olympiad
7410244 i will commit to this team until i cant walk no more
7410245 to win another one lisa leslie got four and she wore all four to the game tonight i want to catch lisa i want to catch michael phelps
7410246 im just so excited about how many want to go forward
7410247 i know we have a lot of great young talent in the nba that will probably be on the 2012 team im more than committed to being on this team again
7410248 i look back at 2004 and im so proud right now
7410249 that person will have a structure that jerry and all these people have built
7410250 i think the greatest part of the continuity should be jerry and the players the ones who still feel like they can give that type of commitment
7410251 the young guys coming up that want to be a part of this make sure you have the right mind set
7410252 thats be unselfish with everything its not about you shining its about the team shining
7410253 they had a bad start before they left for athens in 2004 but with lebron and those guys coming back for this and telling everyone how cool it is its going to be a hot ticket theres going to be a lot of competition to play for this team
7410254 its his moves his ankles its his whole lower half its everything about him he just wiggles free
7410255 hes got long legs and a long arm span hes kind of built like a spider that helps him to change direction real well hes very shifty hes got real good flexibility
7410256 if he lost he was going to cry hed sit inside and cry
7410257 but winning hed just put that big smile on and thats it
7410258 he wasnt real muscular but he could certainly throw the football and take a hit
7410259 wed scrimmage a little bit and hed make a play and we were like dang
7410260 once we watch the film i get amazed sometimes at how i get away i dont know
7410261 they have given their very best in a fair play environment and achieved amazing results by breaking 38 world records and earning 85 olympic records
7410262 the chinese people have honored their commitments they solemnly made
7410263 he was just making everything we all have those days and he just got his on the right one
7410264 anytime you see somebody play that well you can say his strength is hitting the fairway hitting the green and then making a putt
7410265 my mother is an angry woman shes not even happy when i get up and down from 350 yards
7410266 i feel like i was extremely justified to do what i did
7410267 i needed to do it and thats the way it went
7410268 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it and thats it i feel like the score is even and it just cost him more than it cost me at the time and thats the way it is
7410269 kyle had the fastest car on the long runs all night
7410270 my only chance to get him was on the restarts
7410271 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
7410272 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me
7410273 just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the race track
7410274 afterward he said sorry man my car was just faster
7410275 so in my mind i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens thats the way it went and thats the decision i made
7410276 he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7410277 its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7410278 but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7410279 he just explained to me that you reap what you sow which i believe
7410280 i explained to him that thats why it happened that way
7410281 its the type of hit that occurs once or twice a year around the world
7410282 i have guys i have to take care of right now
7410283 we have to take care of the gfeller family and their wishes too but we have a football team i have to take care of and seven other coaches and we have to get ourselves back together and be able to get through this
7410284 its a form more common among younger women and african american women
7410285 we wanted to find out what puts women at risk for this
7410286 thats why we cant use hormonal treatments on these tumors
7410287 weve known for a long time that breast feeding reduces your risk of breast cancer and that it was probably related to hormones
7410288 one possible explanation is that while women are breast feeding they arent menstruating and so their hormones arent cycling
7410289 it helps explain why some women are at higher risk and also why certain therapies are not effective against these more aggressive forms of breast cancer
7410290 i think we can try to win several silver and bronze medals
7410291 when boxers like teofilo stevenson used to fight for cuba it was completely different because they had a lot of experience in international competitions
7410292 they knew how to handle every situation without losing control these guys came here with a huge responsibility a lot of pressure and they couldnt win gold medals but theyve never given up they gave their best until the end
7410293 we could not be more proud of our athletes for everything they accomplished here in beijing both on and off the field of play
7410294 our first priority going into these games was to compete clean and we are extremely proud that our athletes are sharing our commitment to this principle they represented our country with pride and honor and with one of the best u s olympic performances in history
7410295 in kenya we have many medals but im glad i have this one
7410296 its the most glorious day for rhythmic gymnastics in china
7410297 its just a coincidence that its bobble day for me that it happened but its nice to have that many fans out there and win a ball game like that
7410298 i was planning on swinging at that fastball but i saw rickie take off so i figured id take it let him get to second scoring position
7410299 i think he hung it a little bit and it found a hole for me
7410300 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7410301 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7410302 winning bronze is not the same as going home empty handed
7410303 i like my spotter hes a good guy but man that was ridiculous
7410304 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i was just running along heard clear clear and went up there and there was someone waltrip still there
7410305 im pretty upset about it there were a lot of people that got involved in that who shouldnt have been involved because it shouldnt have happened
7410306 we were just listening to each other on the phone
7410307 weve all gone through triumph and tragedy in the past four years and we saw one at the beginning of this tournament here
7410308 who knows why this guy did what he did if i spend time getting angry thats not really going to help me heal or help me support my wife or my family
7410309 twenty seven is an age when your body starts talking back to you
7410310 federer doesnt need fame and money but hes got to get better hes got to go to a whole new level thats the only way he stays in the game
7410311 i let him know during the at bat that it was a bad call and i told him to go look at it
7410312 the thing i liked most was the next series deangelo came back and hit one of his own
7410313 all youve got to do is help get them through a hole and make a guy miss
7410314 theyve both got the speed the power that was evident tonight theyre ready to have success
7410315 i think their style fits our offense jonathan is more physical but deangelo as small as he might seem hes a very physical runner in the open field
7410316 whether im out there or hes in there the other team cant really tell
7410317 the only thing that changes is the numbers 28 stewart and 34 williams that keeps the defense on its heels if were running the ball effectively like coach fox always says its that much easier to pass the ball
7410318 if i got it i got it but its supposed to be fair play theyre supposed to go by the rules
7410319 shes a good 6 feet 2 and she was that tall going into her senior year in high school all arms and legs
7410320 she was phenomenal then gifted and shes such a team player as well its exciting to see someone like that bloom and still be playing now you knew she was special
7410321 ill probably catch up on a lot of sleep the next few days
7410322 it felt really good to be the world champions especially since i made the last out
7410323 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7410324 we didnt have a great exhibition game last saturday at unc wilmington
7410325 so i think the girls were very very anxious to get out and kind of play better and take it to a different level than we did last saturday we did that but it comes down to finishing we did a great job of finishing
7410326 it fired me up making the u s team is a great priviledge
7410327 but i definately give an extra bit with her in a heat
7410328 do not follow where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and blaze a new trail

7410331 barack obama has viciously attacked john mccain and his family for being successful and living the american dream
7410332 this even after mccain has given so much for his country
7410333 but ask yourself this if obama cares so much about your family why doesnt he doesnt take care of his own family first
7410334 may this house stand until an ant drains the flowing sea and a tortoise walks around the whole world
7410335 we think the logistics of getting such a deal done are very challenging particularly with amds equity value and cash position falling everyday after all why would a firm want to do a deal with amd today when it can just wait a little longer and do the deal even cheaper
7410336 we are assuming that amd does not reach operating profitability in 2009 and will not successfully transition to an asset light strategy by the end of the year
7410337 the allegation is that he went around to a property there was an argument i understand there were alleged threats mr balmer said
7410338 if it had occurred they would have plucked him straight away he said
7410339 o amor do papai do c u maior do que eu possa imaginar
7410340 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god
7410341 thats why people stand strong with christianity because it teaches people to lead a good life and not do wrong
7410342 ill watch the discovery channel and say ooh thats interesting
7410343 but theres a difference between thinking something is interesting and believing it
7410344 the kids who swallows too many marbles doesnt get to grow up and have kids of his own
7410345 mr roberts continued i honestly dont think he meant to hang himself i think he was mad about the computer game and just did something stupid mrs roberts added that the family had watched an episode of the bbc drama casualty together weeks before which had featured a young person hanging themselves she said it did occur to us a few weeks after this happened that we had seen a casualty programme on a saturday night at about 8pm this had shown a hanging i know i was really shocked they had shown it at that time but i dont think anything he had seen influenced him when he was younger he had a bit of a temper and hed had tantrums with us before recording a verdict of accidental death at the inquest in scarborough coroner michael oakley said there is no evidence whatsoever that he took things he had seen into account

7410351 bitterness is the poison we drink hoping the other person gets sick
7410352 im impressed with our whole rookie group jacob is a good football player the best thing that happened for us is jacob played mike tolbert played at fullback and both of them had mental errors where they did not block the guy they were supposed to block and we took sacks on back to back plays one of them was a walk in touchdown where we missed a block they other one was going to be a real competitive chance for a touchdown pass and mike tolbert took his eyes off his guy and missed it thats what im talking about the fact that theyre getting the snaps theyre getting right now theyre going to be playing in our games the fact that theyre getting those snaps right now hopefully will eliminate a couple of those errors because when they know what to do and they do the right thing theyre both very good football players

7410355 antonious was thirsty so he asked for a drink of water and then for another and the prison guard was probably nervous and said youll get a pain in your belly from the water and he said the last thing im worried about is a pain in my belly im going to be dead in a few minutes
7410356 he had a handkerchief and a 100 000 rupiah note and he asked me to take those out of his pocket and give them to his wife
7410357 then he said father are you still there would you come forward and take off my shoes so i went forward and took off the shoes and he wanted his wife to get the shoes
7410358 after they were shot they were hurting they were moaning and it takes seven minutes to die the blood was coming out so then i tried singing a few hymns when they were dying so you could say its torture shooting people its torture
7410359 its torture its seven minutes to die so the heart is trying to pump the blood to the brain the brain is still alive and as long as theres blood getting to the brain the brain is not going to die

7410478 according to very preliminary information a train carrying fuel exploded on the railway which we think was mined

7410484 these laws will give the commonwealth government power to suspend welfare payments if people dont have their children enrolled and regularly attending school
7410485 but theres no excuse for not having children regularly attending school
7410486 if children are to benefit from education if they are to get the best start in life then they must be enrolled in and regularly attending school

7410493 you cant celebrate pittsburgh without celebrating its spirit and soul and for me that means african american gospel music
7410494 we have about 100 singers from various churches various faiths various races that have come together to sing the gospel
7410495 when you brought in a national gospel artist they stayed at your house and you brought them to your church
7410496 its just as substantial as jazz and ballet and the symphony
7410497 for me this is really substantial that were doing it on this level at this time
7410498 so we are trying to celebrate and acknowledge the accomplishments of young people
7410499 a woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter of a billion dollar campaign operation and then blames sexism in society will dampen the dreams of our daughters

7410515 the stuff that we like is the stuff that i guess holds a mirror up to the world that we live in and the world that we care about and so ultimately we just wanted to tell a truthful romantic love story which hopefully was really funny
7410516 one of the funniest things that ive found on tour is when i look out in the audience i see people with a home depot apron hat or a shirt and theyre pointing to it like hey check this out

7410518 i feel ive always used acting in my life as a survival technique
7410519 thats why i dont really feel at times that im a real actor who does his homework and all that stuff i got into acting when i was pretty young it was a response to when i was younger and was thinking about something and my mother would say to me get that miserable look off your face id say oh im not miserable now somebody pays me to do it i constantly question it and i constantly question the value of it and see that it sort of perpetuates those insecurities

7410525 i think its very interesting that were looking at new information regarding oil exploration and extraction
7410526 were not trying to solve the national problem or the problem of energy but this is to examine the natural resource of oil as it effects the county
7410527 it looks like theyre looking for revenue streams in royalties and fees but they need to weigh the cost versus the benefit
7410528 the difference with the tranquillon ridge project is that there would be minimal impacts to the environment whereas brand new facilities are a completely different story
7410529 this is the point in time where we should really explore options for other energy sources and look to the future

7410536 this is our first year in the show and its funny because we drove this car to solvang on our honeymoon almost 40 years ago
7410537 this is a fantastic place and just a great setting for a car show all the cars are beautiful and you can tell people really put in time and effort into their vehicles

7410672 in my seagoing career i saw the worst of enemies become the best of friends as a result of making that ship run on time safely and in the commercial world cost effectively
7410673 i truly believe we wouldnt have terrorism if we employed people if we had job opportunities for people
7410674 one of the palestinean girls had never had an opportunity ever to be on a boat we couldnt get her away from the steering wheel
7410675 we might be able to apply it in other countries not just for conflict resolution but for economic development
7410676 i want six young men and women to perform as one
7410677 it was really great that we and israelis got to be friends really fast
7410678 i thought it would be hard but it did well and we got very easy communicating
7410679 we had to stay awake from 4 a m to 6 a m to 8 a m to watch that the boat is not moving away
7410680 so it was nice to sit and talk with her and to laugh with her with all the rest also to sit and laugh and to make crazy things
7410681 i will soon be in the army in this nice quiet and relaxed place its possible to get to know each other in a way that wouldnt be possible in israel or palestine
7410682 i think that to return a little bit of the land of israel
7410683 i think that now its starting a generation of people who are going with their own ways our age they have their own thoughts and start going sometimes against their parents and against their parents thoughts doing what they want to bring the peace back
7410684 when youre an adult its much more complicated with all the politics and stuff
7410685 they are going to have six or seven different teachers in the same day for example
7410686 for the seventh graders we are going to have a light schedule at first so they can get used to their homerooms there will be icebreakers and a cookout in the afternoon of the first day but after a couple of weeks they will be fine and they are going to get to know the students on their team very well
7410687 we had to eliminate the late bus on thursday unfortunately so it will just run on tuesdays this year
7410688 one teaching position was made part time also its too bad but we tried to make cuts where it would least impact the kids
7410689 the building is in good shape but looking ahead i would love to be able to widen the fields because we could certainly use the space
7410690 a lot of faculty have volunteered to assist with this and the primary goal is to promote mutual respect and kindness we foresee members doing some community service projects and fundraisers along with that we are also going to periodically mix students in the cafeteria so that everyone feels welcome here and nobody gets isolated
7410691 but i love the junior high age and good teaching is really important in the middle schools we are a junior high in name but the philosophy is more like a middle school its not just about grades we need to teach the whole person so i am interested in connecting the kids with the community and with local history for example we are trying to bring in authors and we also encourage people in the community to share with the kids
7410692 i want to remind students to do their reading because were going to be doing interdisciplinary lessons based on this book throughout the school year
7410693 this whole business of whether to vote hillary is just an example of when theres nothing important to discuss
7410694 they feel this is an important movement in history to cast a vote for her but whatever the reason is it will give people an opportunity to express themselves then go on either unanimously or by acclamation to endorse barack for president
7410695 i think sen clinton on tuesday night will be magnificent she will demonstrate the grace and dignity to not only put her candidacy in perspective but to help transition help people understand that this election is not about personalities its about issues
7410696 with hillary you had 18 million enthused dedicated supporters who were really committed to her candidacy
7410697 theres no intention to do anything else but make sure theres a historical record of her tremendous campaign effort as the first woman who has actually gone through the gauntlet of challenges throughout all the states and has actually won more of the popular vote
7410698 i know one thing i know i dont want to see john mccain be president of the united states
7410699 i think what we need to do as democrats is remind people we have an opponent in john mccain who is certainly out of touch with the average american i think weve got to be telling people what were for thats the challenge that barack obama has before him in the next few months and thats where hillary clinton is going to be very very instrumental
7410700 hell have the largest audience of this entire campaign when he addresses the american people
7410701 bush has made a mess of things and i think people are ready to have someone tell them the truth and theyre looking for answers
7410702 we were constrained you cant talk about economic disparities you cant talk about class warfare now the intellectual climate is much better for a democratic attack
7410703 one thing to watch with obama is that hes a very focused and disciplined guy who has a strategic plan that he is implementing
7410704 when push comes to shove he will be very tough theres the academic side versus the chicago street side
7410705 i can tell you that internally there has been a lot thats been happening in terms of moving organizations into place not just in the battleground states but newly in play potentially dispositive swing states the nevadas of the world the colorados of the world new mexico even minnesota iowa wisconsin missouri theres a tremendous amount of good old fashioned organizing thats going on
7410706 we are very pleased with what the artists created for us it was a lot of work
7410707 we received more than 3 000 after all expenses and it will go a long way in reducing the loan
7410708 part of the host agreement with the town is that they will be picking up the recyclables for rochester
7410709 they come and they pick it up and they keep track of how much recyclables are picked up by household
7410710 i think this is a great program because not only does it make it easier to do recycling but it also provides an incentive for residents to recycle
7410711 at this point i dont know why were there but its not my job im told to go there and i go
7410712 i dont really think about it much you learn not to think about it
7410713 but i have to put food on the table and im too lazy to work and too afraid to steal
7410714 they need people i just feel like its my job to do
7410715 if i can ever stay in the states long enough it will be finished
7410716 this is what he loves to do and what kind of wife would i be if i didnt support him
7410717 i send him the cake and he puts the frosting on and the jimmies and candles on
7410718 there were 52 red white and blue ribbons on telephone poles on tucker road when he came home
7410719 the miniature can only be entered through an act of imaginative projection looking at small objects viewers will get very close and the object will fill their field of vision theres no scale in the imagination and very small things can become psychologically large
7410720 i am not having my period on a normal cycle when i do have it its really long or spotting for months
7410721 this magic world is not unreal or fanciful but a world of imagination and eternity visible to all who do not refuse to see with the transfiguring eyes of love
7410722 some day you will go to india where you will get your greatest inspiration
7410723 relax man its not like it was when you were in prison the last time
7410724 hey what are you doing tomorrow oh yeah you need to wake up take a shower put on some clean clothes and go see jesus

7410727 w hy should i be responsible for paying for joe bidens brain aneurysms
7410728 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7410729 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7410730 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7410731 we should have had a boston tea party over this
7410732 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7410733 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7410734 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7410735 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7410736 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7410737 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7410738 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7410739 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7410740 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7410741 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7410742 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7410743 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7410744 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7410745 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7410746 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7410747 about what it means to be a good or bad catholic as a politician
7410748 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7410749 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7410750 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7410751 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up

7410784 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university my ancestors who worked in the coal mines in northeast pennsylvania and who would come up after twelve hours and play football for four hours its not because they werent as smart its not because they didnt work as hard it was because there was no platform on which they could stand

7410788 left realizing that it was more than an exhibit there was also a story to be told on the silver screen
7410789 in the documentary she was very observant about sports and reflective about how the culture changed

7410836 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7410837 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7410838 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7410839 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7410840 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7410841 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved

7410851 for example for industrial arts studies home economics science classes and computer classes these areas of studies need equipment and proper facilities

7410883 a striking example of the presence in american indians of genotypes not from haplogroups a d is haplogroup x this haplogroup represents a minor founding lineage that is restricted in distribution to northern amerindian groups including the ojibwa the nuu chah nulth the sioux and the yakima as well as the na dene speaking navajo brown et al 1998 unlike haplogroups a d haplogroup x is also found at low frequencies of 4 in western eurasian populations despite a shared consensus rflp haplotype substantial genetic differences exist between the american indian and european haplogroup x mtdnas phylogenetic analysis and coalescence estimates for american indian and european haplogroup x mtdnas exclude the possibility that the occurrence of haplogroup x in american indians is due to recent european admixture they also clearly indicate that the two branches subgroups are distantly related to each other and that considerable genetic substructure exists within both groups brown et al 1998 haplogroup x is remarkable in that it has not been found in asians including siberians suggesting that it may have come to the americas via a eurasian migration the virtual absence of haplogroup x in eastern and northern asia raises the possibility that some american indian founders were of european ancestry in that case as it has been proposed haplogroup x was brought to america by the eastward migration of an ancestral white population of which no trace has so far been found in the mtdna gene pool of modern siberian eastern asian populations brown et al 1998

7410887 an eou refinery will face a double tax component on the specific excise duty which in all likelihood it would like to pass on to the buyer of the product thus if the price of imported diesel is at rs 45 a litre the product sourced from an eou refinery will cost rs 48 a litre this would lead to mounting pressure on the already cash strained omcs

7410897 we might see some pressure in the q1 and q2 numbers but markets are looking beyond that the commodity cool off is proffering some positive triggers for the market
7410898 this is now said to extend beyond subprime and includes some prime assets such as commercial loans credit cards etc only a third of these have been written off meaning there is two thirds to go until this unwinds we wont see any meaningful reversal in the flows situation

7410900 the problem would come under some control and banks would not need fresh capitalisation then that liquidity will be available for investment in emerging markets
7410901 despite the potential demand from developing regions the lack of decoupling means that nearer term global cyclical forces will be stronger than long term secular ones in our opinion

7410913 the pe segment gives opportunities that are not usually found in the equity space and therefore it fits into the banks growth strategy it also helps to take advantage of the banks high capital base

7410919 i get up at 5 a m every morning and so i take my medications about 5 30 a m with my breakfast and i usually have fruit juice
7410920 some medications arent absorbing well in the gut when theyre taken around certain fruit juices
7410921 if you were taking an allergy medication allegra and you took it with your fruit juice in the morning it wouldnt work as well
7410922 if you still wanted to have your fruit juice it would be best to try and separate it from your medications
7410923 my ankles would swell up and then also my blood pressure would go up
7410924 my ankles i can see but your blood pressure you cant usually tell that its rising

7410946 there are a couple of precursors to us making the offer
7410947 one is we want to make the offer in the native language of the build that youre running and were having text localized and translated now
7410948 were refocusing efforts on delivering a firefox 2 gt 3 major update within the next week
7410949 weve got a lot of interest going on right now which is great for business
7410950 top gear has a massive audience across the globe so we thought it was time it had its own place on youtube
7410951 will serve notice on 25 000 people across the uk requiring each one to pay 300 immediately to settle out of court those who refuse risk being taken to court the companies will target their initial legal actions on 500 people who ignore the letters
7410952 be part of the audience as national geographic films these two monumental house moves to be featured on the hit show monster moves this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness a part of raleighs history in the re making
7410953 green bay has not looked as good as they were a year ago in the preseason they have taken a step back on the defensive line i think its a smart move playing cullen jenkins at three technique he can still play outside but they will get a lot out of him inside they have to play him there because they dont have a lot else they traded corey williams the 2007 first round rookie justin harrell is still missing with injuries johnny jolly might be in jail soon
7410954 the way mike mccarthy uses his talent makes his talent look better than it truly is thats why he is a good coach he puts his players in position to be successful
7410955 losing rookie olt chris williams is a major setback for the bears you dont overcome it its a multimillion dollar mistake that is not easy to fix where do you find left tackles they dont grow them on trees im just surprised john tait has not moved back to left tackle yet he played there the last three years it is not that difficult to figure out
7410956 broncos rookie rb ryan torain looked real impressive before he got hurt but the surprise has been on the offensive line rookie olt ryan clady has played well and ort ryan harris has stood out hes tough he has been burying defenders the broncos got him at a great price 07 third round
7410957 rookie de alex hall has looked good in cleveland he is standing up and putting his hand in the dirt in four man fronts he has athletic ability and bend to come around the corner he has upside he will get more chances in this league if the browns do not keep him
7410958 vikings s madieu williams might be out for the year they already lost their ace special teamer heath farwell he is done their third defensive end brian robison has a more serious injury varicose vein than people realize you cant ever take that lightly it seems like everyone media predicted them to win the super bowl this year but they might actually have to show up to play their games they are getting hit hard by injuries
7410959 i dont know if detroit has regressed but i dont think they have improved any they swapped a lot of players got rid of a bunch of guys and brought in a lot of tampa guys that im not sure made them any better their issues are the same issues the offensive line the running game the quarterback they got two receivers and thats about it on offense they will be better on defense they dont have the big guy shaun rogers inside anymore but cory redding should be all right hes a year into his money when guys get a huge payday mentally they tend to slip theres always that upswing the year before they get paid and then they dip like they made it its like shangri la hits home they do have speed at linebacker
7410960 when you talk about teams that always find a way to field good linebackers despite personnel losses you have to mention seattle and the giants
7410961 everywhere chargers lb coach ron rivera has been linebackers have played at the top of their game the bears fell apart defensively when he left i dont know how he is not a coordinator somewhere eagles defensive coordinator jim johnson s disciples are doing well everywhere they have gone steve spagnuolo just won the super bowl leslie frazier was with the colts the year before hell rivera got fired the year he went to the super bowl explain that
7410962 the giants are very vanilla on offense but they still have one of the best offensive lines in football they have not been sweating the loss of jeremy shockey at all it does not even look like they even blinked since he left second year te kevin boss is good hes a better blocker than shockey he just does not bring the same speed
7410963 brett favre can get it done with the receivers he has the group is not great but they are functional brad smith is getting better laveranues coles can play jerricho cotchery is effective inside 15 yards in the short passing game they picked up a tight end in the first round dustin keller who can run and brett loves his tight ends if thomas jones stays healthy their offense will be in great shape they will be running all the screens you could ever ask for it could be a dangerous offense i dont know that the defense could stop anyone but they will be able to score they are not that bad defensively but they are just not good
7410964 i saw reports about vikings olt bryant mckinnie getting suspended that was news to me i would be surprised if anything comes out of it
7410965 when you look at the nfc north lately its like they are playing hot potato trying to give the division away to each other first the vikings trade the best receiver in football
7410966 trust me i know what im talking about im a panda
7410967 a friend gave me a two dollar bill to carry through my mission
7410968 and i gave that same bill to another missionary after i came home
7410969 stick it in a corner of your wallet and keep it with you
7410970 dont use it for just anything keep it safe when youre really stuck somewhere and you need help youll have it
7410971 victory is reserved for those who are willing to pay its price
7410972 you know willie wonka said it best we are the makers of dreams the dreamers of dreams we should be dreaming we grew up as kids having dreams but now were too sophisticated as adults as a nation we stopped dreaming we should always have dreams im a dreamer
7410973 start by doing whats necessary then whats possible and suddenly you are doing the impossible
7410974 oh at least they did something original making a internet journal
7410975 the bus service across the line of control loc has been suspended as of today monday but is likely to be operational on its next scheduled date after a fortnight
7410976 the prime minister will lay the foundation stone of the bodoland university a planetarium and a science museum cum children park in kokrajhar
7410977 i am losing my sight and have developed multiple diseases since my son was arrested in india i want to see my son i want to hug him before i am gone
7410978 his friends told us that they went for hunting and sohail got separated from them and they couldnt find him
7410979 since then i have been waiting for my son in the hope that well be able sit together again
7410980 if they want to detain him they should have used special provisions in the law this is a clear case of illegal detention
7410981 raj has done a lot for my uncles release and says he would soon be sent to pakistan
7410982 if kashmir singh who was jailed in pakistan on spying charges can be released why cant my son
7410983 he has done nothing wrong and i wish to meet him before my death
7410984 if he cant be released please send me to india so that i can spend my last days with my son
7410985 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7410986 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7410987 obviously the ultimate goal is for labs to avoid having to use animals altogether eventually
7410988 it is showing the model we use explaining how we go about making it and how these skin equivalents are used to guide and minimise the use of animals when we develop new wound healing therapies
7410989 we collect skin donated by consenting patients who have had surgery resulting in a surgical off cut and the skin is then processed in our laboratory to isolate the cells once they are growing healthily again we can bring them back together and create the multi component skin equivalent in the lab
7410990 so we deconstruct the skin and its cells and then reconstruct them we cannot use the skin off cuts themselves as those cells are dying and we need to get the cells back to a state where are growing healthily again
7410991 i also sold a bronze sculpture politician by krishna murari to a collector in gurgaon for rs 150 000 i thought the canvases and the textile art would go first but i am so glad that the sculptures have been sold
7410992 vermas untitled work a steel and iron cast installation showing the impact of mega industries on rural lifestyles in bastar has been booked several times over
7410993 i never thought i would be able to show my work in india
7410994 i have had bookings for almost everything from a wide cross section of people including a senior politician who is also an art collector
7410995 as art is becoming more collector based awareness about sculptures is growing indian taste for sculptures is changing from the old british concept of decorative sculptures to contemporary installation art and solid figures
7410996 finding artefacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
7410997 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away
7410998 till 2003 only a small percentage around three fourth of one percent of indian papers were written in collaboration with chinese authors
7410999 there has been a slow but perceptible rise in collaboration
7411000 south south cooperation the case of indo chinese collaboration in scientific research
7411001 the number of indo chinese papers has steadily increased over these eight years from 124 in 2000 to 361 in 2007
7411002 multidisciplinary physics physics of particles and fields astronomy and astrophysics nuclear physics and applied physics top the list with 468 189 181 83 and 59 papers respectively
7411003 considered collaboration with china to a much larger extent than with india
7411004 has had no impact whatsoever on the workers or the environment
7411005 it occurred in the conventional part of the plant far from the nuclear reactor and it was controlled with appropriate measures in some 10 minutes
7411006 moral responsibility to do the right thing and the right thing we would expect in most cases will be to look at returning them to their rightful families
7411007 collectors in india are very much trying to find ways into western art
7411008 in many ways this is the most important exhibition by a non indian artist hirst to be held in india
7411009 it was a reiteration of the governments policy to continue its brutal war on muslims
7411010 the indian state too has targeted muslims branding them terrorist after 9 11 and the indian parliament attack muslims were targeted once again our party is willing to unite in a broad front with all the genuine democratic forces which would be willing to fight back the hindu fascist offensive
7411011 weve created a buzz in this market weve started to sell more and more tickets more sponsorships and we decided wed try to make an impact to continue the momentum plus we had to send a message to our young players that were committed
7411012 that s one thing we ve lacked our power play has been really subpar the last three or four years and we needed to upgrade that
7411013 he can log a lot of minutes and is similar to duncan keith with his feet probably a little more offensive minded than dunc but those two guys can play a lot of minutes
7411014 now both of our defensive tandems have excellent speed and can get the puck out of trouble and up ice in a hurry
7411015 if it doesnt work out with the number of games each goalie plays or someone not wanting to be here then well have a look at it
7411016 the timing could not be any better than it is today to see the enthusiasm this team has generated is awesome
7411017 i m really looking forward to getting this thing to where it should be
7411018 i think the big difference for us is were not built around older players any more
7411019 the leadership group of this team and the core of this team has changed in the past couple of years were a younger team now
7411020 the stars captain is the perfect combination of goals and grit and the right man to be leading a team on the rise
7411021 hes the second best power forward in the league behind jarome iginla
7411022 the playoff monkey is off his back and the stars goalie is one of the best and most dependable stoppers in the game
7411023 any time somebody walks away from 50 million 60 million 70 million i dont know exactly what the number is hes coming here because we give him the best chance to compete and get his name on the stanley cup
7411024 do we split up pavel datsyuk and henrik zetterberg and play hossa with one of them and mule johan franzen with the other i dont know that yet but i am thrilled
7411025 we thought our team was so much better after he arrived just with the fact that we didnt have to play nicklas lidstrom as much
7411026 lidstroms a great player but we dont need him playing 30 minutes a night twenty five is just fine
7411027 ericsson is going to be a big part of next years team
7411028 hes a 6 5 stud that weve had in the program and hell get a chance to show
7411029 pittsburgh might not have made the playoffs without him its great to have him aboard but ozzies obviously got the ball we dont plan on wearing him out fifty games is good so its a good opportunity for conklin or howard
7411030 that doesnt mean well win more games or the cup but we got great kids coming up and our core guys are young and are going to be better
7411031 well we usually find a way to keep our guys i don t anticipate a problem
7411032 i want to talk to the agent and i like to sit down and make sure that the player hears from me what i m trying to get them and my reasons for what we re offering because usually what we re offering is a little bit below what they can get on the open market
7411033 as long as marty turco keeps stopping pucks and the balanced attack continues to produce the stars will be contenders in the west
7411034 however its the potential impact that sean avery and or fabian brunnstrom can provide that may be the difference between winning and losing versus detroit this time around it appears as though the two teams are once again on a collision course
7411035 highly athletic and ultra confident turco resides among a handful of elite goalies goaltenders in the game
7411036 the highly anticipated late blooming swede should see a regular shift for dallas and could pile up a bunch of assists
7411037 last years rookie sensation has just scratched the surface of his all around potential
7411038 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7411039 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7411040 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7300 a year
7411041 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7411042 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7411043 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement
7411044 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement
7411045 for the first time many employees may have the opportunity to earn extra money through good performance
7411046 we have promised we will preserve entitlements that are important to our current employees including redundancy pay grandfathering parental annual and long service leave penalties and hours of work
7411047 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7411048 antonious was thirsty so he asked for a drink of water and then for another and the prison guard was probably nervous and said youll get a pain in your belly from the water and he said the last thing im worried about is a pain in my belly im going to be dead in a few minutes
7411049 he had a handkerchief and a 100 000 rupiah note and he asked me to take those out of his pocket and give them to his wife
7411050 then he said father are you still there would you come forward and take off my shoes so i went forward and took off the shoes and he wanted his wife to get the shoes
7411051 after they were shot they were hurting they were moaning and it takes seven minutes to die the blood was coming out so then i tried singing a few hymns when they were dying so you could say its torture shooting people its torture
7411052 its torture its seven minutes to die so the heart is trying to pump the blood to the brain the brain is still alive and as long as theres blood getting to the brain the brain is not going to die
7411053 margaret told me she was very concerned for kens safety
7411054 when other people drink my drink that means im not drinking my drink and thats f cking bullshit
7411055 what you call the routine drill of keeping these gentlemen under house arrest where they freely received guests and visitors who would be shown in by armed guards provided to them by the government has been broken now
7411056 this is just symbolic to add to the deterrence of the prohibitory orders
7411057 we wont allow any such thing to happen and they know it now
7411058 it s an honor to be inducted into the u s hockey hall of fame its a big thrill
7411059 i appreciated everything usa hockey ever did because i am not sure i would ever been an nhl player without the opportunity they gave me i am honored and thrilled to be a part of this class
7411060 they gave me an opportunity to play and to find out who brett hull was as a player having them show the faith in me wanting me to be a part of the program was all i needed ive never forgot that and i never will
7411061 one of my greatest moments in the game because i had never been a champion and never had any team success
7411062 you know what the greatest part of that was they never once said anything they never booed until we became that team that was able to beat canada
7411063 when they got scared of us as a group playing against them thats when they started
7411064 that was a great feeling because we knew we were a great team and the guys realized they were booing because they were afraid of us it really made me feel good and deep down i think it made the other guys good as well
7411065 after we won i remember standing next to chris chelios and i asked him what i should
7411066 i had never won before he said just go with it it was a great feeling and it really brought to light what it was like to win as a team and be part of a championship team knowing that is a feeling that i wanted to have with my nhl team
7411067 watching the playoffs last year and watching the series against detroit i think if you throw me in the lineup in that series it is definitely going to make a difference
7411068 i think the last two years have proved how i play in the playoffs and thats the time of the year thats the most fun to play and the most exciting time
7411069 detroits a great team and there are a lot of great teams in the west but certainly the physical presence and just that extra kick start there are a lot of things that i am going to bring to the table that are going to help our chances against a team like detroit or san jose or anaheim or whoever the team we are going to be playing in the semifinals
7411070 the team im coming to is certainly a better team that i formerly i played on i think this is going to be a better opportunity as far as winning goes so thats obviously a big attraction
7411071 secondly the relationship ive had with brett since i played with him in detroit and now his move to management putting the faith in me that i am going to be able to come in and help this team win i think those were the two biggest things
7411072 its going to be tough to play against mike ribeiro brad richards myself morrow mike modano
7411073 thats a lot of speed and a lot of firepower coming at you
7411074 with hockey players we can have our battles and as soon as we come teammates that is all forgotten
7411075 if anything its going to be exciting to get a chance to maybe play with him on the same line or just play with him on the same team its going to be great you almost have more respect for guys youve battled whether it is playing or actual fights or even in the heat of the moment with a guy like steve ott its certainly going to be a lot of fun playing with them it will probably bring my fighting majors down a little
7411076 one of the better things about hockey players in general is that we leave it on the ice we dont hold grudges
7411077 you get a new team and guys are always welcoming and you are brought into the family quickly it should be fine i hope so anyways
7411078 im coming to a team that s happy to have me and expects a lot out of me
7411079 i think i m ready to take it to the next level i think i showed a little of bit that in new york now i ve got four years to really try to showcase that
7411080 it is my number one goal right now to participate in the stanley cup playoffs and go on from there
7411081 it was disappointing to get close a few times in florida and just miss but this game is bigger than just one player and we need 23 guys all focused on the same goal
7411082 any time to get a good player you have to give up and obviously we have a hole to fill with keith ballard and nick boynton being gone but we really feel that we got a big horse in the middle a guy that can play a lot of minutes can score big goals for us and can give us a physical presence
7411083 just as important it takes pressure off kyle turris and marty hanzal so we dont have to lean on those guys theyre only 18 and 20 years old
7411084 last year we didn t have too many guys who would fight so i took it upon myself
7411085 they expressed to me they want me on the ice more and hopefully i can chip in more offensively
7411086 what s interesting is that at the end of the year when i talked to shane doan and ed jovanovski and derek morris i asked them if they thought we needed more toughness
7411087 he s a big player that can eat up some minutes and move the puck
7411088 have to figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit
7411089 i think that unless the republicans get out some really good scare tactics and trick people on what obama really stands for obama will win because i think hes bringing something different that nobody else has
7411090 i am objecting to the way obama was chosen as the nominee
7411091 he didnt win because he didnt have enough delegates the superdelegates chose to select him through pressure from the dnc and democratic party leaders like pelosi dean and donna brazile
7411092 he added further salt into the wound by not picking her as vp
7411093 i think that is a slap in the face to hillary supporters and all women should realize what he just did he ran on change and to get rid of old washington and he chooses someone who voted exactly like hillary on the iraq war his big issue
7411094 hes an old white man from washington with years and years and years of washington experience how is that change how is that going to win hillary supporters it just made me even more mad
7411095 to be honest i dont think its just a hillary clinton problem i think you have a race problem and thats what were going to have to overcome in addition
7411096 if you talk to people in idaho and indiana and parts of pennsylvania i dont think they totally understand that when they get obama they get a whole package of people trying to make a better country for all of us and race shouldnt matter
7411097 obama has the best political organization ive ever seen in 40 years of democratic politics and i have confidence that in the end theyre going to squeak through
7411098 and if our european tour had played better here at home she might have been the pick
7411099 we needed the foreign policy on the bottom of the ticket more than we want to admit
7411100 we have enough problems with them as it is putting sebelius on the bottom of the ticket would have been another stick in the eye
7411101 biden is very well aware that his sons deployment is going to be a big part of what we do in october its part of our narrative and were going to milk it for all its worth
7411102 im talking about putting another name in nomination and sending senator mccain and conservatives across the country a message were not going to sit back and surrender our party just for a political victory senator mccain says hed rather lose an election than lose the war in iraq i feel the same way about my party and i know other conservatives think that way too
7411103 right now there are only two ways to send mccain a message the convention or the ballot box in november id rather send the message sooner rather than later because we cant afford to allow obama and biden to win
7411104 this little girl she grew up and moved away and she she lived her life full of risk and full of play she lived her life with so much to say
7411105 as for the game itself shaun must complete a series of fetch quests and mini games while ensuring he stays well out of the way of the farmers keen eye for example his first objective is to round up 15 sheep whove escaped from the pen before the farmer returns from market
7411106 i think theres real power in people reflecting upon a very real moment in history and seeing what that has to do with where we are now
7411107 he told us that nonviolence was a steady loving confrontation
7411108 shes finding as she looks back there were things to say about their past she didnt say the first time
7411109 at this time in my life i thought i would be on a cruise ship to panama or the mediterranean
7411110 but im a single lady now and i want to keep working
7411111 because i dont have to work 365 days of new material into a year i can still take some time off to paint and travel
7411112 some editors are skeptical id say most are taking a wait and see approach fan reaction has been positive its never been done before so well just have to see what happens
7411113 were doing away with our op ed page on some days to save costs so we need the space for doonesbury which is all fresh strips
7411114 the same thing happened when we killed peanuts after charles schulz died its going to be a long day but for us its the right decision
7411115 our executive editor decided to keep it because we had so many phone calls when we stopped running it earlier this summer
7411116 were going to keep running it for now and see how it goes
7411117 dat zijn we ook even van plan geweest maar vooral ik heb veel te doen in nederland zegt postman die als zoon van een nederlandse moeder en een surinaamse vader in suriname is geboren en is opgroeid in rotterdam
7411118 ik heb hier optredens en ook muziekstukken klaar voor een nieuw album waar ik in nederland mee aan de slag wil
7411119 d jate que te consuma este fuego no apagues ya m s esta hoguera donde no hay fuego no habr luz cr eme que estoy clavado porque te amo no encontrar s en otro lado no tengas miedo no te dejar las veces que t me reclames yo gozo al ver que quieres regresar d jame que yo te levante
7411120 no te preocupes te rescatar mi vida cambio por la tuya
7411121 you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today
7411122 try to compare a stale looking computer to something that has a flowing glow of light just beaming from the case ultraviolet liquid pumping through tubes theres the excitement of seeing all the circuit boards lit up and viewable
7411123 sick of looking at those stale old beige or dull coloured towers
7411124 i think people enjoy seeing if it the mod can be done
7411125 and when it is done it reminds them of their favourite old consoles from back in the day and has a nostalgia factor
7411126 several years ago i wanted to get into a new hobby since the old one independent filmmaking was tiring me i decided to see what i could hack up using an old atari 2600 gaming system i managed to make a portable version of it and did a web page describing the process requests came pouring in and ive been doing mods ever since
7411127 most people want their technology to look like technology but there are always those who are drawn to a more nostalgic sense of style
7411128 people want to have things worth keeping there isnt much manufactured today that will stand the test of time
7411129 theres the problem of last weeks technology looking embarrassingly out of date and the pointless expense of upgrading things that dont need upgrading
7411130 on the other hand make a keyboard look a century out of date at the get go and in 10 years that steampunk keyboard is just going to look better for some authentic wear
7411131 i was fascinated by the retro futuristic computers and other technology in the movie brazil by terry gilliam and when i bought myself a new computer i decided to convert my old one into a brazilian machine
7411132 never continue in a job you dont enjoy if youre happy in what youre doing youll like yourself youll have inner peace and if you have that along with physical health you will have had more success than you could possibly have imagined
7411133 unfortunately due to absurd unnatural feminist inspired north american laws which run contrary to our natural biological urges men are restricted from groping women at will therefore it is imperative that the touching be consensual the key is getting women to feel both comfortable and aroused at the thought of being treated like a piece of meat at a slave auction
7411134 cost per meeting is 29 gst paid on line 24h in advance or 40 dimitrified cash at the door if you prefer annual membership is just 269 gst which includes admittance to all toronto real men meetings works out to about 22 meeting regular meet amp greets with sluts from the community 10 off dimitri the lovers products amp courses and a subscription to the prophets controversial monthly newsletter toronto slut alert
7411135 of course to describe bobby kennedy as a great speaker betrays his legacy it would be like saying that beethoven was a piano player or that michelangelo painted ceilings
7411136 most americans would be glad to pay 10 percent more for their hamburgers if it meant knowing that their fellow americans could work their way out of poverty feed their families pay their rent and have enough time left at the end of the day to show their children how much they truly loved them
7411137 it has to be unjust that campaign contributions dominate our elections because it violates the theory of one man one vote
7411138 has dedicated itself to a vain attempt to turn this years democratic national convention in denver into a simulacrum of the notorious 1968 chicago convention when mayor richard daleys cops busted the heads of anti war protesters in the streets
7411139 and with george mcgovern as president of the united states we wouldnt have to have gestapo tactics in the streets of chicago
7411140 the police want so badly to crack some skulls its so obvious
7411141 as primaries have proliferated the nominees are obvious before they get there so conventions have lost a lot of their meaning what they really have become is cheerleading sessions theres no contest any more i liked it more with the fight
7411142 at least three of the following five colors red green yellow blue purple and white
7411143 sure the conventions were there to choose the nominee for the respective parties but it was also a very elitist institution it used to be real party elites almost all men party platforms were being crafted and deals were being made in arguably a very un democratic way this wasnt people power this was elite political party power
7411144 now everything is ironed out before hand because they know the media will be covering it they dont want to highlight the differences everything is vanilla now conventions have become the political version of reality tv
7411145 the convention catches the attention of the decided and undecided voter it affirms it confirms and it firms
7411146 so its there for everybody if youre already a big democrat or republican you want to see what your people are up to can they articulate the message how do they do it
7411147 you get party business done celebrate together you raise the enthusiasm and the excitement and you establish a marker in the mindset of the american people to capture their imagination that will thrust you forward and that will launch you into the general convention
7411148 devout robert kennedy fan as a youth who keep s a jamie wyeth portrait of john kennedy in his office at the reagan white house
7411149 the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials it measures neither our wit nor our courage neither our wisdom nor our devotion to our country it measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile and it can tell us everything about america except why we are proud that we are americans
7411150 few will have the greatness to bend history but each of us can work to change a small portion of those events and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation
7411151 the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play
7411152 for us the list is formal recognition of our success in growing our business its also great for us to have a benchmark allowing us to compare our growth to others by rankings and to have an objective organization that canvases the marketplace and shows us what other growing private companies are up to in general were proud to be officially recognized as one of the countrys fastest growing private companies by such a credible source
7411153 a listing on the inc 500 showcases how more companies are realizing that our products help with their broad it challenges
7411154 this growth is the result of a strong team solid technology and listening and responding to customer needs
7411155 were excited to be recognized on the inc 500 list as it is a tremendous validation of the innovation and commitment to customer service of the passageways team we would like to share this spotlight with our employees customers and partners
7411156 weve experienced significant growth over the past few years and are on track to continue that trend moving forward of course making this list is an honor yet the most impressive aspect about passageways is the strong profitable growth we have achieved
7411157 although i have no plans to buy a gaming console in near future i we dont watch a lot of movies let alone downloading or buying a lot of 1080p hd content but who knows
7411158 the teams are so evenly matched i wouldnt doubt if it went five games again this year
7411159 theyve been such close series the last few years i think it can go either way again this year
7411160 weve been a guy short here a guy short there but for the most part weve had all of our guys out for every game
7411161 we were watching game 3 between the grays and the royals and i was pretty impressed with the way the royals were hitting the ball around the baseball park
7411162 were hitting the ball hard our pitchers are throwing better and were playing as a team
7411163 this win was a good start for our team but we know we can play much better defensively
7411164 we showed some nerves early in the game but our players responded positively and we finished strong
7411165 ive been brought in and i have to listen to what the boss says
7411166 sometimes youre not the boss at work and youve got to listen if you dont do your job then youre not going to be around im not even looking at it as going from head coach to assistant coach im just looking at it as a great opportunity to come and help the organization and the staff there do the best we can head guy in the pijhl or assistant coach in the bchl i know where i want to be and i know where a lot of guys would want to be in my position
7411167 whatever has happened has happened right im coming in as a new guy thats the way im looking at it i dont know the details and im not getting into it its not my business
7411168 he actually worked for me for a couple of summers i always kept kind of an eye on the kings and talked to royel and stuff he gave me a call about two weeks ago and said hey throw your resume in there and see what happens obviously i threw it in and i was lucky
7411169 the year before we were in transition from moving from poco to port moody
7411170 we didnt really get settled in our rink until december
7411171 i think he was a bit faster back in the day but i think ive got it on him now
7411172 not a chance i am faster and he knows it
7411173 hes really quick so if he can adjust when to go and stuff hell be good good offensively
7411174 we love joe joes a great player for us and geoffs a kid weve been working on for a number of years to get him out of kitimat to come in and play
7411175 hes going to be given every opportunity to make the team despite the fact hes not overly big hes technically a very good d man and plays his position very well hes a really fast guy really strong for his size and hes not a liability out there in any way shape or form
7411176 he has told us that he has elected to go to school this year in vancouver and isnt sure if hes going to play hockey
7411177 i would not anticipate him being a spruce king this year
7411178 marcus didnt really know what was going on until about a week ago and he thought it was just shin splints
7411179 i wasnt having a good time playing there i needed to take some time off to figure out what i really wanted to do and get my head back into it now im back and ready to make a big jump this year
7411180 they have some similarities to mike comrie at the same age and we all know how that turned out
7411181 i dont think hes the kind of player were looking for up front no
7411182 were looking for defencemen i think well be ok up front and in goal
7411183 we spent lots of family holidays together and christmases he was just a great guy to be around its just kind of unbelievable you know theres a risk of him being in the line of fire but you dont think its going to happen to him
7411184 its never been my favourite thing to do in the world
7411185 everyones telling me they hope i change my mind but i havent been on the ice since march and i havent missed it at all
7411186 im just a kid my mind can change at any moment im not going to promise im never going to play hockey again but for now i really dont want to right now i dont think ill regret it people who make it to the nhl want to be there at the rink every second of the day
7411187 la principal es la persistencia el hecho de que puede estar ah todo el tiempo

7411194 the persistently gloomy outlook for the us economy and oil demand and spread of the economic downturn from the us to europe is weighing on prices
7411195 also as the us dollar gains strength the oil pricing comes down so the movement in the us dollar is also driving oil in the short term
7411196 this week i expect oil will move depending on the us dollar movement
7411197 jessica walked in with her girlfriends and her group was singing
7411198 en las afueras de una peque a escuelita insignificante se ve an los ni os
7411199 this can help in some ways by adding a little drama to days that otherwise would not have much drama to them and it might attract more viewers to watch the convention
7411200 of course if viewers are attracted and then theres a catastrophe of some sort that would not be good news for obama
7411201 shes likely to play her part but its her die hard supporters on the floor thatll be hard to control if it all breaks down then they might as well kiss the election goodbye
7411202 i have no problem with the decision to do this
7411203 they deserve a lot of respect theres no reason to squelch other peoples opinions and then everyone should feel that theyve been treated fairly
7411204 i think that a lot of clinton activists including women are going to move to obama i find it hard to believe theyre going to vote for mccain
7411205 we need to come together and show a strong unified face at this convention
7411206 there is a difference there but it is not personal though
7411207 as a corporate sponsor you will be invited to exclusive forums and special events where you will interact with our local and national government as well as business leaders from around the country
7411208 at amp ts role as a good corporate citizen is to showcase the elective process in the best possible light the presidential conventions give at amp t a unique opportunity to present and display the many leading edge technologies and products that we offer to tens of thousands of consumers
7411209 do i buy it theres no doubt in my mind and theres no doubt in the minds of these corporations that this is good marketing it shows an interest and an investment in the process
7411210 you dont do huge outlays of cash if youre not looking to establish relationships
7411211 we cannot be more pleased with the chinese peoples presentation of the games and their hosting of the games
7411212 they did an absolutely amazing job running the meet if we needed water they had water if we needed ice they had ice if we needed a towel somebody got us a towel i cant explain to you how well run the meet was
7411213 we pledged a clean team it appears weve done that
7411214 these games are significantly more competitive than those in athens
7411215 coming in we said that china was going to be a strong country and as the host expected a bump
7411216 you see that more in their gold medal count right now than maybe their total medal count for the increase theyve had from previous games
7411217 we dont gauge our performance strictly on the number of medals
7411218 weve been clean and drug free we could not be more proud of how this team has behaved and exhibited olympic ideals
7411219 if we dont take that into consideration you can really get bashed
7411220 five minutes extra sleep means my family can tolerate me in the morning
7411221 the idea is to give students something to look forward to in this case a two year degree that can lead to a good paying job
7411222 sometimes you have to take a half loaf and love it
7411223 community colleges remain a very good bargain where only a small fraction of the cost of comes with a tuition payment
7411224 so it remains a very inexpensive way to get an education here in our state
7411225 i would love to come back around to that subject before i leave office
7411226 right now theyre running on the right lane well switch them to the left side
7411227 the pond serves to slow down the flow of water so it doesnt overwhelm the drainage system
7411228 basically our goal is to have it down to the topping in the spring
7411229 the pungent odor of asphalt wafts through the air around hall of fame drive evidence that
7411230 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7411231 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7411232 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7411233 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit
7411234 may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7411235 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7411236 obama joked he was running for president to have secret service protection for his daughters 10 year old malia and 7 year old sasha when they start dating

7411240 society has no right to be unjust to a single one of its members the whole society minus one is not authorised to obstruct the latter in his opinions nor in those actions which are not harmful in the use of his property or the exercise of his labour save in those cases where that use or that exercise would obstruct another individual possessing the same rights
7411241 when you want to blather away into the ether collecting the accolades and shunning the negative response youre not advocating for speech to be free youre advocating for talk to be cheap
7411242 a leftist idea can be recognized by three earmarks it will be
7411243 and threaten use of the coercive power of the state to extract compliance
7411244 i could tolerate leftists if they had any coherent ideas for a better way to do things but they dont they cling stubbornly to failed brain fart dreams that have been attempted over and over again with disastrous results but they never learn when better ideas come along they simply screech and holler at them then fling feces like the monkeys they are
7411245 extremism in defense of liberty is no vice moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
7411246 i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
7411247 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
7411248 how a politician stands on the second amendment tells you how he or she views you as an individual as a trustworthy and productive citizen or as part of an unruly crowd that needs to be lorded over controlled supervised and taken care of
7411249 i think we have exactly the same problem of other central banks
7411250 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7411251 i would say what has been done until now has been pretty well done under very difficult circumstances

7411266 dengan suku bunga yang tinggi kita harus cari pola pembiayaan yang lain untuk membiayai ukm saya cenderung menggunakan modal ventura kita gerakkan lagi
7411267 sekarang kita pikirkan dimana modal ventura ini dimasukkan dalam apbn karena infrastruktur yang mengelola modal ventura ini dimana mana sudah ada misalnya jabar ventura jateng ventura
7411268 ini juga menunjukkan ada deal tersembunyi yang membuat qtel tidak mengganti direksi indosat yang berasal dari stt maupun temasek
7411269 pencairan tahap i sudah dilaksanakan oleh karena itu diperlukan persetujuan dpr atas sebagian atau seluruh sisa pencairan blt tahap kedua
7411270 perlu konsep dan tata kelola yang baik 2009 suasananya tidak mudah apalagi masih ada evolusi dari tahun 2007 hingga 2008 dimana harga komoditas naik tajam dan pemerintah menggunakan sebagian besar resource untuk subsidi
7411271 karena anggaran tersebut harus dikembalikan untuk kemakmuran masyarakat di daerah dan harus bisa dipertanggungjawabkan secara akuntansi atau politis
7411272 karena itu dana ini harus digunakan dengan tata kelola yang baik dan disalurkan degan sebaiknya kemakmuran masyarakat di daerah
7411273 untuk permasalahan ketenagakerjaan antara lain karena masalah lapangan pekerjaan formal yang masih terbatas yakni hanya 36 9 dari total lapangan kerja
7411274 jadi kalau kita bicara kesuksesan daerah pembangunan daerah efektifitas dalam national economic policy tergantung pada kemampuan provinsi keinginan dan kompetensi mereka dalam mengimplementasi peraturan
7411275 karena besaran inflasi non moneter itu lebih banyak datang dari daerah harus ada supply side management untuk menangani inflasi lokal dan demand side management untuk mempromosikan pertumbuhan ekonomi lokal

7411279 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of human rights violations with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
7411280 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
7411281 it is high time for the ioc to put its core values of human dignity and universal fundamental ethical principles into practice by making human rights a new pillar of the olympic games

7411288 the only position for which i was properly trained was eliminated
7411289 but i am not closing the door on future sports reporting positions i will not leave pittsburgh
7411290 you cant celebrate pittsburgh without celebrating its spirit and soul and for me that means african american gospel music
7411291 we have about 100 singers from various churches various faiths various races that have come together to sing the gospel
7411292 when you brought in a national gospel artist they stayed at your house and you brought them to your church
7411293 its just as substantial as jazz and ballet and the symphony
7411294 for me this is really substantial that were doing it on this level at this time
7411295 so we are trying to celebrate and acknowledge the accomplishments of young people
7411296 no one will want to hire me if i come from a community college or a calstate

7411298 world economic growth in 2009 is likely to be the slowest since 2003
7411299 every world regions growth is expected to slow next year and the list of countries in or near recession is expanding
7411300 the us in my view will now have to come to grips with a much slower growth trajectory

7411543 we are really happy that the population of this area will benefit from modern facilities complete with adequate water and electricity supplies
7411544 this is expected to be an excellent addition to an area and a population which suffered greatly because of the tsunami and it will make a sizeable difference to the pregnant women and newborns of pottuvil
7411545 prior to the tsunami we did not have a separate dedicated store for the region and now thanks to the generosity of our donors we have a store closer to us with all modern facilities to maintain a regular supply of drugs and basic medical equipment
7411546 yeah its kind of hectic i woke up early this morning and packed up all my stuff
7411547 depending on how the traffic is going in and out of the dorms it might take us all day
7411548 this is the third trip back to the dorm weve been to walmart three times and were thinking there may be more trips
7411549 pretty busy getting all the supplies making sure we get everything checking our list twice

7411552 im gonna ride my bike its more convenient and i dont have to worry about gas or parking
7411553 yeah catching a bus or carpooling together that would be good
7411554 so we dont have unneccesary stalls on the roads that everyone experieinces and we all know what happens to traffic when theres a stall on the road

7411577 the dollars strength is pushing the dollar rupee up but there is always fears of central bank intervention in the market
7411578 bigger companies like bharat forge have the expertise to diversify into the non auto segment large auto ancillary companies are looking to diversify into non auto segments now as they have reached higher levels of consolidation in their manufacturing segments
7411579 we are de risking our model by not just depending on one market alone but building in different portfolios
7411580 we are enlarging this part of our business as part of our overall objective to grow substantially
7411581 we are looking at increasing automotive sales overseas and increasing industrial sales in india
7411582 diversification is becoming a motto for amtek auto too though its is still focusing on its core auto components market
7411583 we are expected to open up with a gap largely on overseas cues
7411584 but i reckon any gains would be capped around 2 per cent at the end of the day as concerns about our markets have not changed
7411585 the combination of incremental weakness in the european economy and the lower oil prices should keep the pressure on euro dollar in our view
7411586 the easing of tropical storm fay and the pullout of russian troops from georgia has taken some risk premium out of the market
7411587 but there will be some degree of geopolitical tensions as long as russia still has troops stationed in georgia
7411588 even with oil prices down the global liquidity crunch remains very much with us
7411589 u s and european portfolio managers continue to reduce risk in their portfolios emerging markets are the higher risk asset class hence we are suffering disproportionately
7411590 we are expected to open up with a gap largely on overseas cues
7411591 but i reckon any gains would be capped around 2 percent at the end of the day as concerns about our markets have not changed
7411592 investors remain hesitant to take risks as fundamentals have yet to improve
7411593 i dont think investors will come back to the market anytime soon
7411594 the stock market has been at mercy of oil prices and if sentiment for stocks was really bullish then the market should still have been able to hold firm even when oil prices rebounded
7411595 the easing of tropical storm fay and the pullout of russian troops from georgia has taken some risk premium out of the market
7411596 but there will be some degree of geopolitical tensions as long as russia still has troops stationed in georgia
7411597 i guess the 800 psychological level support will come into play again i believe physical demand for gold is likely to remain good and perhaps the shortage may support the market a bit
7411598 if we start moving below 810 we will probably move to 800 very soon and perhaps gold could retest to the 770s again
7411599 oil fluctuates every day but 110 is the bottom price
7411600 jewellery demand from italy and india will gradually improve 800 will be maintained
7411601 near term support for platinum should come in around the 1 350 level and if we do move below those levels we could see another bout of selling towards 1 250 to 1 300
7411602 theres not a lot of history as far as guys playing in the league besides javon and ronald
7411603 none of those guys has really played before so it would be tough to only go with two guys who have played before
7411604 we have some guys we can count on so well just look to the next guy
7411605 the last cuts some good people are getting let go on some of the good teams
7411606 its as bad as it can get as far as issues with the knee
7411607 i have to remind you guys that its preseason and you guys can figure out what that means
7411608 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7411609 angelina has been screaming at brad over the tiniest things
7411610 i cant shes just too good a dancer for me
7411611 there is concern at the very highest level that kate middleton still does not have a job
7411612 the queen is keen that the monarchy should lead by example and that the princes and their girlfriends should all be seen to be hard workers
7411613 the queen has made it known that she feels kate should get involved with a charity possibly an animal charity where she can be seen to be doing something proactive and something entirely safe
7411614 it is important that kate isnt seen to be doing anything controversial and she needs to do something completely different from any of the charity work that diana did
7411615 she has quite a bad reputation for being rude when it comes to responding to letters
7411616 she often fails to rsvp when she is asked to attend events she once failed to reply to a wedding invitation from one of williams friends and it didnt go down very well
7411617 this is an extremely difficult time for me and my family
7411618 i would like to thank all those who have offered their love and support my main concern at the moment is the welfare of our family
7411619 i will be making no further comment at this time and would request that the privacy of our family is respected
7411620 i realised that i needed something to do that was going to feed my soul
7411621 but it was the beginning of what i recognised to be a great opportunity to play with somebody who was really serious about music
7411622 nothing comes between them and their art and i find that really inspiring probably because i dont see myself as being quite that
7411623 but the next beautiful blonde girl in the front row and it would all be on again
7411624 taste is the thing playing things for musical reasons and not because you can or not because youre dying to do a certain thing to be inspired by the music thats the big thing then having the chops and the sounds to be able to play what you want to play
7411625 if i were to sit down for an ian moss gig with the drums i use for saxophonist andrew robson
7411626 it would be a very different ian moss gig because the sound would dictate to me a lot of how it got played

7411637 i wait on him hand foot and finger to be fair and thats the way i like it his mother spoiled him and now i spoil him he is the most spoiled spoilt boy
7411638 i like to be able to cook for him and have a nice clean house when he comes home and clean clothes and stuff im a pisces quite a dreamer very lazy but im not lazy when it comes to the baby and my house im quite obsessive compulsive about cleaning i want it to look like a show home
7411639 if im out in the garden with ruby it really pisses me off i hate thinking they can print photos of her she has a right to anonymity i dont want those f ers getting money from her so i might start picking them off only joking i promise mr policeman it wasnt me
7411640 i dont smoke any more but when i go out im dreadful like i have no idea of my limits so i drink way too much which is binge drinking and we all know how bad that is
7411641 they are strangers to me i dont know if they are moral im soft as shit really ignorance is bliss im staying in my own ignorant bubble right or wrong
7411642 i am quite shocked myself at how sane i am i think my family

7411669 hey i just took a look at your old dish its not gonna work properly with your new dvr and i cant do much about it since i was only supposed to install the receiver you need to call directv and clear this up in the mean time ill set it so it receives a signal but you wont be getting any hd channels until the new dish gets here
7411670 i do apologize for all what happened like you said it was very unacceptable but what ben said is true getting a new dish wont be happening today i see we have you down for getting a new dish on the 15th
7411671 please tell me that the term the 15th is some sort of code for within the next 15 hours and not september 15th
7411672 mrs lancaster i notice that you have canceled your nfl season pass service
7411673 are you kidding me youre bringing up the nfl season pass this has nothing to do with the season pass and everything to do with crappy service i dont even want your service anymore and you want to talk about the season pass what the hell
7411674 im seeing that we can offer you something called an on time guarantee credit basically what it is is 100 off your account for your trouble
7411675 you know what im not sure thats enough im going to have to think about it and call my husband
7411676 well it would basically take care of your bill for over a month its the best we can offer right now
7411677 its the best you can offer but we still dont have service and wont have service until september 15th i dont see how thats acceptable
7411678 no ben rigged the dvr to get a signal but in the series of calls to the techs at directv we lost it the techs had me reset the receiver at least seven or eight times which erased the settings
7411679 okay i am so sorry that happened i will definitely pass this information on to our colorado headquarters because theyll want to know the situation unfortunately we cant get anyone out there any sooner than the 15th
7411680 fine go ahead and credit our account im still going to need to call my husband and figure out what we want to do
7411681 um i hope to be drinking my 3rd beer at the state fair by 6 30pm

7411687 people will get to inhabit that world before they see the film
7411688 weaving a product into the entertainment as opposed to breaking up the entertainment which is what ads tend to do is a smart strategy
7411689 it is getting easier to avoid watching traditional tv advertising
7411690 the consumer increasingly has the power to change the way they consume content and that has really driven the whole trend towards product placement
7411691 those placements are not designed to jump out at you as an ad would but its still very very powerful its not explicit advertising but we do know that while youre watching a program all of the content that you see as a whole goes in
7411692 i believe people will tolerate you talking about yourself in a 30 second commercial or even a 60 second commercial but when it gets to 30 minutes youre pushing the limit when youre conscious it is a product placement it becomes distracting
7411693 i think they stopped it at 60 to 70 brands represented in that movie if you have too much product placement it just becomes an ad and people are not that interested in watching a two hour ad
7411694 in the national party we are in the business of reducing peoples costs not increasing them

7411699 hill rom is pleased to celebrate the opening of this important addition to our global r amp d footprint
7411700 our innovation center in singapore represents an acceleration of our efforts to embed increasingly sophisticated and differentiated micro electronics and software in our products we also see the opening of this center as an important step in globalizing our products and presence
7411701 we congratulate hill rom on the opening of its asia pacific innovation center asia presents new growth opportunities for the medical technology industry with its growing ageing population and rising affluence against this backdrop singapore presents a strategic location for companies to tap on asias growth by forging strategic partnerships with our base of global industry partners research institutes and hospitals these partnerships will position singapore as a one stop location for companies to test bed and develop cost effective efficient healthcare systems and solutions for the regional and global markets
7411702 innovation and partnering are key levers for a successful medical technology company like hill rom
7411703 thats why we saw singapore as a perfect location not only does singapore offer great technical talent but also it provides an environment with sophisticated health care institutions and a strong government supportive of growth as our r amp d center ramps up we are looking to collaborate with our asian partners to advance and test new bed technologies and business models with the intent of raising the standard of care offered to patients and caregivers worldwide
7411704 some 3 4 million medicare beneficiaries hit the so called doughnut hole in drug news last assemblage and a large minority depart taking their medicine kinda than clear full toll discover of pocket a newborn inform says
7411705 there have been no publicised clinical trials in customary medical journals display the effectiveness of essiac in the treatment of cancer some of the specific herbs contained in the mixture have shown some anti cancer effects in laboratory experiments however acquirable technological evidence does not support its use for the treatment of cancer in humans
7411706 in the united states herbal and another dietary supplements are thermostated by the u s food and drug administration fda as foods this means that they do not have to meet the aforementioned standards as drugs and over the counter medication s for grounds of safety effectiveness and what the fda calls good manufacturing practices
7411707 we today have a meliorate understanding of how the treatment entireness by increasing the ratio of tumor killing to immune system suppressing cells
7411708 this suggests techniques for further focusing the immune system to move the cancer with less fallout for connatural tissue
7411709 using a vaccine to make a stronger immune salutation to cancer may enable us to use lower levels of ctla 4 blockers which could turn the rigor of their lateral effects
7411710 mommy why do the bad men want to kill mario
7411711 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7411712 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7411713 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7411714 if he cannot reverse that slide starting this week hes toast
7411715 for the first time in my life im proud to be
7411716 a pattern of misleading and questionable practices has emerged from our investigation into home loans
7411717 these unfair lending practices may have harmed thousands of people and in turn negatively affected our communities and neighborhoods throughout the state
7411718 before more people face the prospect of foreclosure or actually lose their homes we need to determine whether individual loans may have been originated through methods that violated indiana law

7411724 it is a little more quiet during the summer yeah
7411725 the most important thing is hand washing soap and water and washing your hands that is a hard thing to do in school because there are not lots of sinks so people do use the antibacterial lotions also
7411726 most of the teacher i talk to really try to spend time with kids washing their hands especially when there is a youngster with a runny nose even at home it is important to get kids to wash their hands and a very hard thing to try to get done
7411727 oh i think it is worse in a day care where kids arent able to handle things for themselves one two and three year olds when they get sick it seems to spread to the entire staff and it seems like entire little communities get sick
7411728 its really hard being a mountaineer fan living in pittsburgh so we want our boys to grow up having the mountaineer spirit so we thought wed bring them down for fun and festivities

7411732 neen op zon moment reageer ik niet als politie inspecteur ieder zijn verantwoordelijkheid
7411733 ik zat al zes keer in de ploeg van de tourwinnaar
7411734 e n keer jan ullrich vijf keer lance armstrong maar de tofste tour die ik meemaakte was toch deze mijn dertiende het hele team was super de ambiance ook voor het eerst had deze belgische ploeg een tour favoriet in de rangen ze wisten niet wat hen te wachten stond een gele trui dat is superhectisch en ja daar had ik ervaring mee
7411735 ik heb twee halfbroers die nog wat gekoerst hebben bij de amateurs ik bracht hen regelmatig naar een masseur en moest dan telkens een uurtje wachten tot die man willy loverie lachend vroeg waarom ik er niet zelf aan begon en dus ben ik in september 1987 naar de avondschool gestapt anderhalf jaar naar kermt drie keer per week 93 kilometer heen en 93 kilometer terug ik ben nu dus een gediplomeerd sportverzorger massages maar ook ehbo tapes leggen en noem maar op
7411736 mijn eerste ervaring deed ik op in 1989 bij histor in de midi libre vanaf 1992 zat ik bij motorola tot armstrong kanker kreeg in 1997 verhuisde ik naar telekom als masseur krijg je telkens een tweetal vaste renners toegewezen maar in 2000 belde armstrong me persoonlijk op met de vraag of ik niet wilde terugkomen maar in een andere functie ploegleider johan bruyneel zocht iemand die specifiek voor de veiligheid en de rust van lance kon zorgen hij had toen al tweemaal de tour gewonnen en de drukte om hem heen werd te groot
7411737 het was toen dat ik door een journalist het etiket bodyguard opgeplakt kreeg een term waar ik niet zo van hou beschermengel klinkt beter het was wel totaal nieuw in het peloton dat eerste jaar gaven journalisten lance en mij de prix citron te afgeschermd en dus te zuur maar twee jaar later waren ze bijgedraaid en kregen we de prix orange voor de uitstekende organisatie
7411738 vergeet niet dat het toen golfoorlog was armstrong werd als amerikaan geviseerd het is je misschien niet opgevallen maar naast mij figureerde toen ook altijd een aziaat erwin ballarta is eigenlijk een texaan hij was de bodyguard van bush toen die nog gouverneur was en we stonden ook alle dagen in contact met de amerikaanse ambassade en de franse staatsveiligheid de enige terrorist die we hebben gezien was die befaamde taartengooier en we hebben hem w l uit de massa gehaald nog voor hij kon gooien h
7411739 dat was ook de sfeer die daar toen heerste iedereen was aangeslagen maar iemand moest toch het initiatief nemen en vino hebben ze toch maar lekker niet in beeld kunnen brengen nee ik wist echt niet wat vino had uitgespookt zoiets door de ploeg georganiseerd in elk geval niet door mij als masseur kom je een halfuur op de kamer en tijdens dat halfuur weet je wat er gebeurt maar niet erna spuiten of infusen heb ik nooit gezet ik ben geen dokter met doping laat ik me niet in
7411740 of ik op zon moment niet als politie inspecteur reageer neen alleen als verzorger niet mijn gezondheid staat op het spel ieder zijn verantwoordelijkheid af en toe heb ik nog contact met vino hij is echt een fijne mens
7411741 de dood van fabio casartelli in 1995 heeft ook mij flink aangegrepen toen hij daar zwaar ten val kwam op de col daspet was ik zijn persoonlijke verzorger bij motorola verschrikkelijk
7411742 het heizeldrama daar was ik bij ook een dieptepunt maar we maken ook positieve dingen mee wanneer elke keer als we een misdadiger kunnen snappen of een mistoestand uit de wereld helpen in 1977 al ging ik bij de politie het eerste wat je hier als jonge agent doet is patrouilleren op en rond de grote markt memorabel want dit is mijn stad ik ben geboren in de hoogstraat en ben fier brusselaar te zijn hier voel ik me het best brussel is voor mij thuiskomen
7411743 waarom hebben ze ex hoofdcommissaris roland vanreusel en politiewoordvoerder christian de coninck brusselaar van het jaar gemaakt ok een boek geschreven maar wat dan nog serge de backer en ik wij zijn echte ketten
7411744 onze burgemeester is ook zon echte ket wat ik zo fijn vind aan die man is da ge geen stokken in uw gat moet steken om ertegen te klappen ik zou heel graag met hem alleen een pint gaan pakken niet voor de gezelligheid maar gewoon om eens te zeggen wat ik te zeggen heb onder vier ogen
7411745 if you can just get your mind together then come on across to me
7411746 pharma generally have done well and nectar lifesciences has had good last three days so i think if it can stay above rs 340 i think levels of rs 440 445 are possible
7411747 abg shipyard has the capability to build a wide variety of vessels and is in the process of gaining a foothold in the lucrative rig business the company has robust growth plans to capitalise on the strong demand for shipbuilding the companys order book of 8 1x fy2008 revenue gives high revenue and profit visibility at rs 365 the stock is trading at 10 1x and 6 8x its fy2009e and fy2010e earnings respectively we see value in the stock on account of its strong order book and robust prospects of the global shipbuilding industry we maintain a buy on the stock with a 12 month target price of rs 445 per share
7411748 one could probably look at gail and rolta gail with a stoploss of rs 370 and target of about rs 425 one could buy rolta with a stoploss around rs 290 and target could be around rs 390
7411749 subex had that sharp move its now consolidating between this rs 92 120 sort of zone these moves are often not followed up if it can go pass rs 120 i think next target here could be about rs 141

7411777 bpcl the strong support now is at rs 270 so till oil remains rangebound it will keep doing this rs 270 to about rs 340 kind of levels
7411778 unitech reported q1 fy09 revenue of rs 10 3 billion significantly below expectations revenue in its real estate business declined 8 qoq while ebit margin expanded on favourable product mix and lower contribution from the low margin contractual business pat came in at rs 4 23 billion which was also below our estimate we recommend a sell on the company with a target price of rs 135 implying 15 downside from current levels

7411864 appear to be starting from the axiom that smart algorithms software designs which cost a lot of work to develop by smart people are by definition intellectual property and that patents on them therefore by definition are valid im incorrect however because intellectual property only pops into existence when the law defines that a particular immaterial creation can be associated with certain exclusion rights the default situation is that creations of the mind are free for use by everyone and therefore patents are the exception to the rule default situation there is no good reason to deviate from this default situation because a plenty of innovation also happens without giving companies people access to broad 17 year exclusion rights b given the complexity of software a single patent no matter how smart you thought you were thinking it up virtually always affects an immense number of independently developed programs during the course of its lifetime c network effects the more people use a particular product technology file format the more valuable it becomes for developers and consumers so erecting artificial barriers is counterproductive for both

7411931 sometimes you sit next to him on the bench and say sheesh take it easy on him especially the cubs fans they think theyre going to the world series and he cost them the home field advantage to report corrections and clarifications contact reader editor
7411932 that definitely put pressure on them and changed the inning
7411933 when hes swinging good he hits the ball as hard as anybody
7411934 we need all the wins we can get because were in a real battle right now weve got a day to regroup and we probably need to
7411935 it was a big win because the blue jays have been playing great and they are one of the teams trying to catch us
7411936 they have played us very well too so to be able to finally win a few games here is huge for us

7411957 today was the most solid performance weve had since ive been here
7411958 it showed in every aspect of the game and it was against the best team in the league im very pleased with the way we played today
7411959 were extremely pleased and proud of the effort by the whole team today
7411960 we had three important players missing and the guys who got the chance to play took it with both hands and made the most of it
7411961 three days after i get back all my closest friends are coming into town all the way from sweden denver everywhere
7411962 were going to go camping for three days at the gorge in washington state go to a couple of shows and concerts and just enjoy ourselves enjoy life for a while
7411963 thats going to be an exciting date for all of us
7411964 and the thing is were all going to be together
7411965 it would be my first preference but well see what happens
7411966 team president peter wilt actually lives like four blocks away from me ive stayed away because i dont want it to be weird
7411967 i really like it there but well see what happens
7411968 i havent really thought about it in the last couple of weeks but obviously los angeles
7411969 its a great time for this to happen because there isnt a lot going on with the national team next year so its a great time to try to transition to that
7411970 itll be less time with the national team but its a great environment with your club training every day with your club a lot more games in its opportunity for pia to see more players so i think its going to help the national team in the end
7411971 for me i need to read the game often practice just doesnt do justice you can be the best shot stopper you can be so good at making saves but if you cant make those decisions in the games youre not going to be a great goalkeeper
7411972 we are not going to cut salaries staff or any other assets that are important to the company sometimes we compensate by raising prices but mostly were just eating the additional costs
7411973 in this economy we are in no position to ask the customer to pay more
7411974 though my company continues to grow chinas shift has made me closely monitor other expenses such as how many hours my team works and how much our office supplies cost
7411975 the sars outbreak in 2003 along with the songhua river spill in 2005 were catalysts for a great national movement to improve the health system and to clean up the environment
7411976 pollution was a major source of discontent among the population but u s retailers were pushing for low costs local officials were bribed to turn a blind eye
7411977 but now beijing has its eye on local authorities manufacturers are being more careful about obeying rules that were previously ignored
7411978 its the responsibility of the importer to ensure that the product is safe and hence the manufacturing facility has to be up to u s standards
7411979 weve had to implement improved processes for dying the fabric and disposing of the water that is emitted from the machines we also have to carefully control the lead content in the dye solutions
7411980 we get certificates of compliance which make the retailer and consumer feel comfortable about the product
7411981 we were running two 12 hour shifts every day but the new labor law restricted how long the temp workers could be on the job
7411982 it was difficult to find enough workers to cover six four hour shifts as an alternative i replaced 20 workers who cut excess metal off the components after casting with an 85 000 machine which has increased my capital expenditure
7411983 theres a feeling that this law might be too much too soon
7411984 hr is a recent discipline and the courts are starting to get overwhelmed

7412032 every day after work it was such a tranquil and elegant environment
7412033 we were childhood friends and saw each other every day
7412034 but this is good for them they re making a lot of money now
7412035 most of the people now living in the hutongs are actually newcomers from outside beijing
7412036 of course it s a good business move but if you think about how it harms the ambiance the whole thing doesn t feel right
7412037 all these people come to see beijing s hutongs because it shows you the common people s lives and their culture if everyone buys the homes and live there the irony is it s not representative anymore
7412038 ive promised myself that i wouldnt fall in love again because its easier because its safer to never feel it again
7412039 at least for the time being it feels like the right choice to make so whatever i have to lose is fine by me
7412040 i lost myself some time ago it sound melodramatic i know but thats how i feel ive compromised too much and sacrificed too much to even know who i am anymore its ironic i set out trying to find myself and i end up farther than where i began
7412041 im not maybe im tired of keeping up a fight of being different of not fitting in but to throw away my dreams and hopes along with my beliefs and faith i dont know if im ready yet
7412042 i know i did after all even when times got hard and i felt like i was left with nothing and no one they were still there to keep me company
7412043 ive been called delusional in the past people said im only living a fantasy but so what if i am to varying degrees arent we all still people tried to put me down thinking that i needed to be brought down a peg or two or that i need to be straightened out
7412044 i dont know for sure i guess on some level my existence bothers them because i dont fit into their ideas of how things
7412045 and your whole idea about never falling in love again how does that fit into everything youve just explained
7412046 it doesnt really i guess i just got hit by a sudden wave of pessimism after all the world hasnt exactly been very encouraging lately
7412047 does it matter youre the one who said that even though the odds are against you you always believe that everything will be alright
7412048 yes yes i did yet everything thats happened lately has affected me more than i thought and for a moment i just let it get to me
7412049 still insist that you wont ever fall in love again
7412050 not anymore i wont hold my breath until i do though
7412051 i dont expect you to just promise you would at least consider the possibility when one comes

7412058 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7412059 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7412060 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up

7412070 a prophet often is without honor in his hometown and that has been true for charlie

7412075 for years we would come out here and people didnt know who parker was

7412082 have written in areas that seem particularly disfavoured by the canadian legal establishment
7412083 we are uncertain of the extent of the legal jeopardy that apsa members might place themselves in should they make public arguments in canada or post those arguments online concerning hot button issues like homosexuality same sex marriage or the nature of the islamist threat to western civilization
7412084 the nature of radical islamism and the relationship of public morality and homosexual conduct are issues of vital public importance

7412087 i am the infamous anglerfish and you must be a dumb mermaid
7412088 dumb not quite i am brighter than your brilliant lure and what you perceive as stupidity is merely lack of consequence and my own mischeviousness
7412089 i apologize isnt it common knowledge that mermaids do not exist
7412090 why obviously they do since you are speaking to one we are a much rarer species especially compared to you and your kind that just makes our value priceless i heard you were going for 150 usd at fisheries arent you afraid that your cover has been blown you live here to get away yet they have found you and like to eat you a human would never eat a mermaid we offer something more than a feast
7412091 well it is quite true that we are being hunted but humans are selfish species if they caught even one mermaid dont you think they would find a way to eat you up even if that meant exploiting you for their own desires it just so happens that most humans desire to eat fish i happen to be a fish but i like you was once a mermaid too
7412092 how is that so you are ugly and reclusive and i am beautiful and social you do not fool me anglerfish give me proof that you used to be what i am
7412093 i once went to a sea witch who offered an antidote to the lack of bioluminescent visions that mermaids have i took it as soon as i could only see darkness there i met an anglerfish it is now that i realize that i should have stayed within my mermial perceptions the six hours that i had down here have been extended to the rest of my existence and i thought i was happy as a mermaid but it turns out that i am much happier in the darkness

7412095 were happy now to see the final demolition started and progressing
7412096 it was an issue we were trying to deal with as the building was dilapidated an eyesore and safety concerns existed because of broken out windows
7412097 he who does not travel has only read the cover of the book not the book
7412098 we went to vancouver one year and we toured vancouver island tip to tip up side down and inside out at the time we had only seen a part of newfoundland and i thought it was a sin here we were out in vancouver spending money so why not visit and travel and see our own province we made the goal then to see newfoundland
7412099 you think about people with their big super campers and they laugh at ours
7412100 they have running water and two big master bedrooms but they cant do what we did
7412101 i like churches and gravestones gravestones are the forefathers of this province the foundation stuff like little post offices or something out of the ordinary if it strikes my eye well go see it
7412102 i have met people from all over the world and never had a boring night its one night in one community and another night in another community
7412103 this man he threw out his casting net and hauled in caplin and gave us some right now we cant go to our beaches the caplin dont even role here anymore because the sailors have them caught in their nets before they even reach shore
7412104 i want to remember him in his days of just undiluted glory
7412105 you listen to the ones who were concerned with what lyndon johnson did on the domestic side and you say there never was a surer touch
7412106 then you turn to vietnam reading the minutes of the meetings talking to people you have a sense of a man who didnt know what to do if i write this book correctly that contrast will emerge
7412107 i said to him if you really want to do this you have to go back and get your notes on the delegates and what went on out there and talk to me in detail
7412108 these were long hours of interviews you feel youre sitting there and you are a hearing a story that with everything everybody thinks they know about american politics nobody knows this story
7412109 he was very pale and thin and it was harder and harder for him to breathe
7412110 began to be realized when president lyndon johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964
7412111 i see barack obama as the apex of the lyndon johnson legacy
7412112 but you cant talk about iraq without talking about vietnam
7412113 you cant leave that out his presidency did not end in triumph
7412114 every generation pays very close attention to the major controversies of the time and when johnson left office in 1969 vietnam was still raging and a lot of americans were furious at johnson
7412115 they werent thinking about a lot of things they had liked about him like civil rights and in 1969 people were not as aware as historians are now of the efforts he made to get the country out of the war
7412116 the sense of that seems to be very much lost

7412151 some people have fears about concealed weapons but since 1995 there has been no escalation in violence and crime across the state of texas has decreased
7412152 there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that allowing concealed carry on college campuses would lead to more problems
7412153 to have more than half the country be in favor of a ban like that goes against the notion that the support for gun control hasnt increased since virginia tech
7412154 people feel just as strongly as ever and we need to get politicians to pay more attention to this issue
7412155 any decisions we make that affect atlanta could affect every other airport in the country
7412156 i dont really like the idea of people coming here with weapons and carrying them into terminals but thats their right as citizens of the state of texas
7412157 if airports think guns should not be allowed they should have the right to modify their security plan to reflect that
7412158 there is no justification for permitting firearms at any airport
7412159 you might like to have a gun in your car because you come home on an 11 30 p m flight
7412160 you have to ask yourself can you think like a snapping turtle
7412161 there are only a couple in there and they stay on the bottom
7412162 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
7412163 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
7412164 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
7412165 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
7412166 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
7412167 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
7412168 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
7412169 it came down to the cost of construction financing and operation of the lakeshore facility
7412170 things like the 20 percent increase in tva rates have been hitting this project for years its hard to point at one thing and say that was the reason
7412171 my husband and i were really looking forward to having something really close by
7412172 at the end of the day the ys got to pay for it
7412173 that would have required fairly major surgery on the design of the building which starts to impact donors wishes
7412174 its on a much smaller scale on a piece of property well have total control over
7412175 its very uncommon for an academic research institute to work directly with a community provider
7412176 that kind of learning curve usually takes years to get from the literature into the field
7412177 weve found that organizations are frequently their own worst enemies
7412178 organizations want to do great things for people but the bureaucracy gets in the way
7412179 now weve got it where we want it and were carrying it out into the community
7412180 what we hope to demonstrate is that because of this particular model that the childrens mental health services research center has developed client outcomes will be improved
7412181 we want to get this to the population as quickly as possible
7412182 tonight i think we did a hell of a job at putting america back where its supposed to be on top of the world
7412183 at 2004 we were asked if we wanted to make a commitment to this
7412184 to do something we have never done before win a gold medal
7412185 all of these guys committed to jerry three years ago we said we are going to have collective egos but we wanted you to bring all of your egos because thats how you get better our coaching staff has not had one second of a problem with our team
7412186 spain was going to be a big problem they showed why they were world champions
7412187 we had a game plan and they countered everything we tried
7412188 every possession counted it will probably go down in history as one of the greatest olympics games ever
7412189 if it wasnt for the determination and the willpower we had we would not have gotten this win
7412190 the biggest thing is that u s is back on top again
7412191 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals what you saw today was a team that bonded facing adversity together and came out with a big win
7412192 a lot of research studies are coming out that seem to suggest some possible link or associations
7412193 it is like setting up a garbage dump on the edge of a river you wouldnt be surprised if the lake downstream ended up polluted with the garbage from the dump
7412194 identified 24 studies demonstrating a positive relationship between periodontitis and preterm birth low birth weight or both
7412195 have a much harder time than other diabetics controlling their blood sugar levels
7412196 three to four times at greater risk of developing periodontal disease
7412197 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7412198 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7412199 the goal is to provide the knowledge tools and resources people need to delay or prevent the onset of diabetes
7412200 the american lifestyle contributes to making diabetes an epidemic and preventing this disease is one of public healths biggest challenges
7412201 our concerns range from how long is the construction going to take to complete this massive project to will the fbc have enough money to complete the project as promised
7412202 the fbc has already broken the agreement with the neighborhoods about belleaire drive
7412203 they had agreed in a meeting with the joint neighborhood committee our attorney dale collins and their attorney to leave the road where it is
7412204 they wanted us to agree in writing that we would never put lights on the field
7412205 we said in writing that we have no plans at this time to put lights on the field
7412206 ive had people come and shake my hand that were from all over
7412207 its a wonderful day its good to see people who care about what you do and that there are officers out there risking their lives its just a great feeling
7412208 officer rickman is a new member of the blue knights and were proud to have him in our unit
7412209 the way we look at it the good lord was looking over him that day he was shot
7412210 i took a trip on it this morning to get used to it

7412250 well that makes a great cover for the harvesting of human organs doesnt it
7412251 competition is the key to progress provided that self glorification and self aggrandizement is perceived to be the hoped for final product both selfish gain and selfish path complement and reinforce each other to replace competition with collaboration we will have to socialise the masses mindset to view collective glorification and collective aggrandizement as the hoped for final product only then will collaboration be perceived as the method by which progress is best pursued
7412252 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7412253 they havent cracked any of the other cable and satellite operators
7412254 with the internet it was a nascent industry when we entered it in tv were novices in an entrenched industry
7412255 the end goal is to show more relevant ads to users
7412256 i dont think google is going to own tv advertising
7412257 they can in search because everyone goes to google com to do a search theyre not going to own tv networks theyre going to be a technology middleman
7412258 they havent cracked any of the other cable and satellite operators
7412259 with the internet it was a nascent industry when we entered it in tv were novices in an entrenched industry

7412261 i dont think google is going to own tv advertising
7412262 they can in search because everyone goes to google com to do a search theyre not going to own tv networks theyre going to be a technology middleman
7412263 google has shown that it thinks about day care the same way every other company does as a luxury not a benefit judging by whats transpired thats what google is fast becoming just another company
7412264 theres just too much of it that is regularly broken it seems like every week 10 of all the features are broken and its a different 10 every week the old bugs are getting fixed the new ones introduced
7412265 the culture at google values coolness tremendously and the quality of service not as much

7412269 the federation council is ready to recognise abkhazias and south ossetias independence if the people of these regions wish and if there is an appropriate decision by the russian president
7412270 this institution has significant funding as do the other institutions both here in canberra and also around australia
7412271 the decisions that are made by the institution are made by the board and by the executives
7412272 they are the ones who have to decide what priorities they are going to set where they are going to apply their resources
7412273 though its really a deep dish casserole many midwesterners lovingly refer to this recipe as
7412274 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7412275 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7412276 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7412277 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused
7412278 it has been a long time since weve spoken and i took a couple of days off so i thought i would just pop in and say hello
7412279 its not a simple balance you know the world as it is today and magic
7412280 pallas fights so hard not to have magic and yet because of her opposition it surprises her with its appearance at the most inopportune times and with i might add some very comical results
7412281 i do thank you for all you have done in this my dear i do not think i could have accomplished any of this without you
7412282 yes you know of that insurgent agent marquess that zephyr has in his custody
7412283 ah yes lady jadrien is up to something i feel it and what better way to find out her evil plan than one of her own leading us to the information
7412284 um i have a few to things to attend to i will leave you two for the moment
7412285 but as she is my employee and has no knowledge of who i am i try to keep out of her private life in the office
7412286 oh what wouldnt i have given to have seen that little episode
7412287 that he was very smitten with her sent her roses to the office that very day
7412288 oh ho i bet rhodium was um not too happy about that
7412289 i seem to remember a little scandal about you two that was
7412290 since he is so taken with pallas we just might have to use that to our advantage
7412291 you are aware my lady that the sparks will be flying when rhodium gets wind of this
7412292 that is part of plan rhodium will drill pallas about sir spenser and she just might reveal something to help with the investigation
7412293 and speaking of business pallas should just about now be getting ready for her dinner date with sir spenser
7412294 i am surprised the knight is not here with that happening
7412295 just wear that cute little sexy black dress you love you look so nice in that
7412296 i dont want to look sexy i just want to look like me
7412297 you are so pretty and im so proud to been seen with you to tell everyone that you are my mom why cant you just go have some fun for a change this guy sounds loaded you know a limo and all those silver roses you know how much they cost and you got like what four or five dozen go see how the other half lives and um take notes
7412298 and i dont think i can make it through dinner having to face sir spenser
7412299 ive never had that reaction to a guy before i mean i dont even know him his personality and yet damn i fell right into his eyes i felt captured
7412300 i dont want to be captured i have to be in
7412301 like i was pulled in trapped somehow and yet i didnt want to be set free
7412302 i think if he had handcuffed me i wouldnt jessandra
7412303 yeah i guess ill be okay just a little intimidated i guess
7412304 get ready and ill get you one last cup of coffee
7412305 and do not let the green eyed monster escape from you
7412306 many a heart has been broken many wars have been fought because of that
7412307 yes you are right charmain and i must focus on my i um heard about the little disaster with miss jones and the paper shredder
7412308 well um yes she didnt inform me to not lean so close to it
7412309 while younger orcs would have either been born somewhere in the conquered lands of southeastern azeroth perhaps even the ruined that orcs were later removed to
7412310 if your character was part of any other clan however she would have been consumed with blood rage like all the rest and would have taken part in the horrors of the genocide as well as the first and second wars
7412311 after the exiled frostwolves charged through the portal only a few orc clans followed these orcs quickly set up a base of operations within the black morass a dark and swampy area far to the east of the kingdom of stormwind

7412331 creo que el equipo comenz a mostrar mejor a empaque y funcionamiento y no se daba el triunfo por circunstancias que pasan en el futbol
7412332 el primer gol de andr antes de terminar el primer tiempo creo que nos dio una inyecci n de nimo
7412333 voy a ver el video tuvimos dos mano a mano una del bofo y otra del mismo rojas un remate de andr antes de hacer el gol y s nosotros tambi n tuvimos desatenciones en los goles eso hay que dejarlo muy claro el futbol as es en algunos jugados se hace mucho menos y se gana nuestro equipo jug muy
7412334 nos esta haciendo falta fuentes el mismo armas los jugadores que por su situaci n no est n con el plantel pero vamos a esperar a recuperarlos nos vamos a ir fortaleciendo y nos vamos a ir haciendo un equipo m s integrado cada vez y es m s f cil as sacar los resultados
7412335 we at joseph abboud are delighted to be extending our partnership with the nfl
7412336 nobody works harder than an nfl coach to ensure his team
7412337 thanks to joseph abboud our fine coaches will travel in style off the field and continue to represent their organization and the league in a first class manner
7412338 clearly the nfl is well on its way to becoming the best dressed league in all of sports

7412340 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7412341 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
7412342 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
7412343 we had a plan to break even and spend 3 million of our gross profits on recruiting ex commander staff in the second half of the year
7412344 we had a contingency in case we didnt cover that cost in the last four months but we ended up breaking even
7412345 our product solutions business grew well but could have done more through the queensland government pc contract
7412346 we were awarded that last september but it took six or seven months to ramp it up and get those agencies into gear
7412347 going forward we see a significant opportunity in the managed services area
7412348 we have now put all our managed services under the one umbrella whereas previously we had these separated across our three divisions we have been successful in increasing our queensland managed services footprint and are now looking to drive this nationally

7412365 fue un partido donde tuvimos muchos errores en la parte de atr s tuvimos desatenciones que no son normales en nosotros y pagamos las consecuencias con cinco goles que son much simos fueron desatenciones muy notorias y los que estamos atr s hay que hacer un an lisis y mejorar y obviamente hay que corregir los errores
7412366 m s que preocupaci n hay consciencia de que hicimos un partido en el que no cumplimos que tenemos que salir de otra forma sobre todo en la parte de atr s donde tenemos que estar m s concentrados y tambi n hay que tener esa humildad para aceptar nuestros errores
7412367 estamos ac para colaborar en lo colectivo que es lo m s importante y para m lo m s importante es que se gan el equipo mostr actitud mostr agallas y deseos de ir a ganar y gracias a dios pudimos conseguir la victoria
7412368 esa fue la clave no desesperarnos eso fue lo que hablamos no volvernos locos demostrar actitud deseos ganas de ir a ganar y el equipo demostr todo eso en el segundo tiempo
7412369 gracias a dios se nos dieron las cosas y sacamos la diferencia de dos goles que adem s debimos de trabajar bastante es muy importante la victoria porque hab an sido tres derrotas consecutivas ahora debemos seguir para clasificar
7412370 tuvimos errores de fundamentos muy claros y ante un equipo como santos con grandes individualidades y que tiene gran contundencia no puedes darte esos lujos el partido lo refleja porque cada vez que nos llegaban era gol pero en t rminos generales chivas no jug tan mal para tener ese resultado
7412371 el equipo est muy triste est dolido porque era la vitrina importante como para que el equipo tomara el rumbo ganador y una l nea ascendente pero estamos tranquilos porque el equipo jug ofensivamente un partido agradable pero consciente de que cometimos errores inocentes
7412372 no es que no est n a la altura rodr guez y olvera est n pagando alguna factura que normalmente se deben de pagar y normalmente estas facturas atr s son m s costosas no es culpar a ellos justamente cuando uno se equivoca todo el proceso defensivo te tiene que ayudar inclusive que cuando jonny magall n que es un jugador muy seguro se equivoca tiene que venir una cobertura para que se pueda solventar esto

7412382 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7412383 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7412384 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up

7412390 xref http ccr sigcomm org online q node 378 a scalable commodity data center network architecture a scalable commodity data center network architecture
7412391 these are optimistic numbers but taking advantage of the commodity side of things will be incredibly disruptive to computing and technology
7412392 there are examples with telephone switches and expertise with clusters of commodity pcs throughout history that show commodity components taking over an industry
7412393 ethernet technology is creeping into the last few bastions of proprietary niche network technology in the enterprise which exist mostly in the data center think fibre channel for storage infiniband or myrinet for high performance computing and clustering applications
7412394 the low cost and flexibility of ethernet are the drivers behind this trend and ucsds research is a good example of just how far this idea can go
7412395 the price per port will be huge and the port density will be tiny
7412396 today is the least compelling time to be thinking in terms of price per port but once you push 10 gigabit ethernet to the edge the existing designs do not work
7412397 if you want to push 10 gig to the servers in a large cluster you wont have any option
7412398 leverage cheap commodity parts for all of the switches in the communication architecture
7412399 we believe you dont have to modify the chips but that it could be done with software and with relatively small modifications
7412400 we are working to determine what the minimal set of modifications to existing switches to enable routing is and to address the cabling issues that come up with a fat tree topology

7412416 what you argue is interesting but i bet stocks will go up
7412417 philosophical questions about mean variance analyses and optimizations is it important for an investor in the accumulation phase to control portfolio variance assuming this is a buy and hold investor not prone to behavioral panics obviously portfolio variance is important in the withdrawal phase but i was hoping to get some feedback on the utility of minimizing variance in the accumulation phase
7412418 im guessing that if you used data intervals of more than one month youd have less of a need to make the potentially controversial decision to constrain the optimization to be sure a larger sample size does allow you to predict return and risk within a narrower confidence interval but its all past data anyway so its not like youre going to be 99 confident that the future is going to resemble the past even with the larger sample
7412419 metlife has been a very good company for us and has essentially allowed rgas management team to run the company in the way it sees fit
7412420 we downgraded the stock because it had really peaked out
7412421 we thought the stock got a little bit ahead of itself
7412422 i think if you look at the companys past performance and the earnings i dont think its stock is overpriced

7412471 straight fuck you on top until you come is 100 euros
7412472 it costs 10 more if you want to do doggy style
7412473 but it costs 120 euros if you want me on top
7412474 well for one i have to work much harder to make you come and second well a lot of men get quite excited by these so close to their face
7412475 and they start sucking them which is fine but many of them lose control and start biting hard
7412476 some of them even make them bleed they bite so hard
7412477 and that is all without kissing kissing on lips costs 30 more
7412478 hmm for only 30 euros you can see my titties for 50 you can suck them and for only 25 you can see my ass
7412479 a hand job is 70 euros and a blow job is 80 euros
7412480 but that is if you want me to swallow it is 90 if you want to pull out and come on my face or titties
7412481 how come is that cum is sticky and messy and i would rather swallow it then have to clean myself up after sucking some guy off in his car
7412482 hmmmm feels like you know what to do so oooh 50 for you
7412483 well if you make me come when you are fucking me i take off 20 that almost never happens men dont fuck whores to give us pleasure
7412484 i charge extra if the man is very big there
7412485 no problems there i was only 6 inches when i last measured in 8th grade it may be bigger now but still nothing that can hurt you or your ummm pussy
7412486 usually i also charge for talking before fucking but you are nice and i have nowhere to go its 20 euros for rubbing your cock against my titties and i charge extra some men like me to tie them up and that is 50 because if they want that they must be willing to pay anything
7412487 no anal i will not let a man fuck me in the ass for any amount of money not after aids has become a problem two of my sisters from ethiopia died because they got aids from that you know
7412488 i would like to try but it has to be with a man i know is clean you know
7412489 also no pain no hitting no hot wax no whips
7412490 what would be the most expensive thing you do would that be you on top position where you do all the work after 10 minutes of conversation with a guy sporting a footlong bone and where he wants to pull out and cum all over your delicious tits
7412491 yeah you know licked each others pussies until we came i dont usually but nadia really knows how to tweak my clit and so for 2000 euros i had to lick a guys cock for 30 seconds and then get the most lovely pussy lapping i have ever had
7412492 i dont know she used her tongue lightly on my clit fluttering over it like a birds wings and then she gently oooooh she gently put her long fingers inside me and then hmmmm she sucked my clit into her mouth
7412493 why dont you suck my titties some more and then i think you would like one of my blow jobs
7412494 oooooh baby you really know what a woman wants dont you
7412495 i could let you do that all night but i know you want to get off before we get to rome so baby

7412497 i want to taste your love cream give asmara your juices baby what do you need

7412499 you want to lick me where that came from you want to suck my clitty you want my juices in your mouth you like the smell of my cunt baby
7412500 you taste fabulous too i love the way your pussy leaked juices into my mouth when you came

7412502 i am going to give you my handphone number so you can call me tomorrow in rome i can show you around the city and maybe we could do some more of this
7412503 oh baby you know i have to eat otherwise i would fuck you for free but i will show you around the city for free can you think of a tour bus where you can get fucked and see the roman sights
7412504 long held fragrance heavy flavor sweet in mouth delicious in throat harmony with tastes famous as perfect liquor

7412511 spot us would give a new sense of editorial power to the public
7412512 im not bill and melinda gates but i can give 10 this is the obama model this is the howard dean model
7412513 crowdsourcing why the power of the crowd is driving the future of business
7412514 its not like the crowd is killing the newspaper lots of things are killing the newspaper the crowd is at once a threat to newsrooms but its also one of several strategies that could help save the newspapers
7412515 were at a point now where nobody actually knows where the money is going to come from for editorial goods in the future my own feeling is that we need to try lots of things most of them wont work youll have a lot of failure but we need to launch a lot of boats
7412516 social economic and environmental impacts as well produce lasting benefits locally and globally
7412517 the world touring olympics the caravanserai olympics the olympics that pitch up and have a party on mombasa beach or the favelas of rio de janeiro imagine fully demountable stadiums and a 50m olympic swimming pool pulled around the world by supertankers the relocatable olympics would regenerate a region and put it under the world spotlight energize the local economy and demonstrate that governments need neither state communism nor rampant capitalism to join the olympic party
7412518 we are pleased to be able to bring our unique energy industry technologies to this region of the world the brunei energy market in particular has gained sophistication quickly and as such it is critical to maintain a local presence
7412519 we welcome the opportunity to work closely with jamico to serve the ndt needs of this portion of asia
7412520 ie 6 cant provide the same web experience that modern browsers can
7412521 continued support of ie 6 means that we cant optimize our interfaces or provide an enhanced customer experience in our apps supporting ie 6 means slower progress less progress and in some places no progress
7412522 most blog spam comes from bots that either fake or as a trojan use internet explorer 6 of infected systems
7412523 we all know that ie6 is outdated and has horrible css rendering engine however most average internet users havent realized that yet why because we put our hard work on it and patch the bugs by various ie hacks

7412548 but in this day and age society has evolved in terms of acceptance of the gay athlete
7412549 there were unique challenges of playing gay ball in a straight world
7412550 but just because were gay doesnt mean we cant play ball
7412551 the stereotypical viewpoint of what comprises a gay athlete may need to be rethought explain that to your wife or girlfriend that you just got your asses beat by a bunch of gay guys
7412552 as society continues to accept the reality that there are gay people out there who are athletes i hope it becomes more acceptable
7412553 but theres so much money does a gay athlete jeopardize his ability to earn money in endorsements that would be difficult to turn your back on potential earnings just to make a statement
7412554 its a tragedy sometimes what the country has done to its own kind because its uncomfortable with issues of sexual orientation
7412555 weve made huge progress in terms of growth and getting beyond the prejudice i grew up with
7412556 can you imagine 41 different cities coming to seattle come on i wouldnt have thought that possible when i was with the huskies and so deep in the closet i didnt know who the hell i was
7412557 five years ago they werent even trying now theyre trying especially college sports pro sports are somewhat getting it on an individual basis most guys couldnt care less who you love
7412558 weve made huge strides but theres still a huge journey to go
7412559 i can put em pretty much where i want to put em
7412560 i like to pitch em high so they pop it up

7412567 the state really made a tremendous blunder in pushing forward on their plan that dooms to forever the loss of revenue
7412568 obviously our goal is to return this to a pristine natural state and let mother nature flourish
7412569 its way overdue thanks to the obstinacy of the former tenants
7412570 its kind of the last piece of the puzzle you might say of crystal cove state park that we worked on for about 30 years to get in place
7412571 there is just no room anymore for these little private enclaves of people
7412572 that was something from the past and it couldnt continue theres this huge public pressure to get to the coast and be able to camp on the coast and enjoy it
7412573 watching it just sit there in a really bad physical state has really disappointed us
7412574 there had to have been some way for the state and the residents of el morro to work together to see that that didnt happen that there was a more orderly transition
7412575 its just taken us nearly three decades to get to the point where the public will really enjoy this
7412576 id just like my kids to be able to enjoy that spot like i was able to enjoy it

7412614 after the season there were rumors about it becoming more like 70 percent of our defense
7412615 no one really knew until the spring and then all of the sudden because last season we used terp but it wasnt as developed but they came to us and said they wanted to base the whole defense on terp
7412616 one of the biggest things is with the leo position sometimes its tough to find guys who can play it because in one sense you have to pass rush and take on tight ends that are generally going to weigh more than you do and are pretty strong

7412646 we had talked about doing another record and theres another record on the table under our contract with metal blade we can do it if we want if we dont whatever but we have discussed doing another record and im kind of excited about tinkering with ideas for it that said if we did start writing a new album and it wasnt turning out like an overcast record i dont think wed put it out it really needs to have a certain vibe it cant be another metalcore record like the things that are going on these days it really needs to have that old school mentality which we had held true back then if not its not even worth it
7412647 you just want for them to have a good time out here

7412649 there are different degrees of epilepsy my seizures are labeled petit mal
7412650 i havent had one in a long time but i generally have the urge to go somewhere and ive just got to go im in rush i got to go i dont know where i have to go but i have to go i make fun of myself to make things easier for others especially when im talking to kids
7412651 the one time i walked to high school and thank goodness i didnt wear pajamas i had some sleep shorts and an old ratty shirt
7412652 i lived about two miles from high school and i walked there one morning really early and a buddy looked at me in the hallway and was kind of like what are you doing
7412653 i was like im going home i clicked right out of it went home and changed and then came right back to school
7412654 i take six pills a day two pills three times a day every day
7412655 as long as im on my medication im fine if i forget to take it for several doses i would have a seizure
7412656 when you tell someone you have epilepsy the first thing they think of is what they see in movies
7412657 they see the guy hitting the ground having the grand mal seizure and they just dont know there are so many different forms of epilepsy there are different forms and people are able to play professional football
7412658 i plan to help and get the word out my daughter anabelle kathryn has epilepsy as well shes 3 years old
7412659 we have completely separate issues so its a little ironic but we both have epilepsy and im definitely looking to improve her world as well
7412660 we brought a bunch of people out to training camp i went to the events and i went to the walks
7412661 i just tried to be a voice in the epilepsy community i did stuff during epilepsy awareness month just lots of things to get the message out to make people aware of me in my situation and by doing that alleviating the stereotype of people with epilepsy
7412662 i think the best thing for kids with epilepsy to do is to just be open about it especially because if something does happen your friends need to know they need to be able to tell the paramedics

7412675 obviously the ball is not coming out of his hand the way it was earlier
7412676 hes a velocity guy hes a 92 to 95 mph guy and when you see him dip underneath 90 thats cause for concern only he knows the answer
7412677 if thats the case that answers some questions but i havent talked to him yet
7412678 i let him know during the at bat that it was a bad call and i told him to go look at it
7412679 i walked out and we just locked eyes i let him know that i saw it and it was terrible
7412680 he just wouldnt take his eyes off me i held up my hands and told him it was a foot outside we exchanged some more words i turned around to go sit down and he started walking towards the dugout i came out and thats it
7412681 it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear
7412682 but after listening to the doctors explanation i am convinced that this is the right procedure the right way to go
7412683 someone has already raised that yesterday and i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time about anything to be honest with you
7412684 i am sure that general manager jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do what is best here at this point in time
7412685 if you can create matchup issues youre in good shape
7412686 thats one of the benefits of spreading the defense and when you have great speed you create matchup issues
7412687 you always have a guy that sets the pace and this year its lou a big thing hes been here since the beginning and hes had a chance to see what it is that we want our players to be hes a product of the system
7412688 you cause matchup problems and you can make up for problems with speed the biggest thing about our speed is that its in so many different positions that its almost impossible to game plan
7412689 its hard for me to say hes not the go to guy
7412690 of course youve got percy harvin and tim tebow two of the finest players in college football but louis murphy is going to be the go to guy hes got to have a good year
7412691 nobody likes to reverse one but when you get the call right everyones behind you
7412692 its inevitable that were going to use it as long as its just where home run calls and borderline calls are concerned
7412693 we just have to make sure its a system that doesnt delay the game any more

7412707 its outrageous that our tax dollars are inflating executive paychecks
7412708 surely in these troubled economic times we can find better ways to spend our nations wealth
7412709 met die stap heb ik vrede maar we horen hier in nederland alleen al het feit dat ik niet kan preken in mn moedertaal geeft me soms het gevoel dat ik een vogeltje aan een lijntje ben je zou wel eens verder willen vliegen
7412710 we hebben bij de overkomst naar grand rapids met de gemeente afgesproken dat we per jaar drie keer voor enkele weken hier in ermelo zullen wonen en dat is heerlijk zeker ook voor mijn vrouw die in amerika natuurlijk niet zoals ik haar werk heeft en het feit dat we hier in holland elf kinderen moesten achterlaten is ook niet niets
7412711 ik ben pas 63 jaar en als ik in nederland was gebleven dan was ik zeker niet met emeritaat gegaan maar voor de derde keer kwam de roep uit grand rapids tot ons en ik wist dat ik moest gaan omdat de rca echter een zelfstandige kerk is kon ik daar niet als predikant van de protestantse kerk bevestigd worden dus werd me door de pkn emeritaat verleend en ben ik in dienst getreden bij de rca dat is trouwens een dochterkerk van de nederlandse hervormde kerk gesticht ergens in de 17e eeuw en al heel lang volledig zelfstandig
7412712 de band met de gemeente in grand rapids is al heel lang heel sterk nadat ik voor het eerste beroep had bedankt wist ik dat dit niet het einde was maar toen er in 2004 een beroep op me werd uitgebracht voelde ik dat ik de gemeente van waarder zo net na de scheuring niet herderloos mocht achterlaten toen echter het derde beroep kwam wist ik dat ik moest gaan en dat was een grote stap alles laat je hier achter je kinderen je kerk je land je taal hier hoor ik maar ik weet door genade dat ik nu daar moet zijn
7412713 en als ik terugkijk dan is er alleen maar verwondering dan kan ik alleen maar zeggen het zijn de goedertierenheden des heeren dat wij niet vernield zijn uw trouw is groot we hebben veel zegen van de heere ontvangen in alle gemeenten al voordat ik beroepbaar werd had ik van de heere te zien gekregen dat ik naar scherpenisse zou moeten ik kende daar toen niemand en wist amper waar het lag maar toen ik nog in mn studententijd door de scriba gebeld werd om een dienst te vervullen zei ik tegen mn vrouw als er uit die gemeente een beroep komt dan moeten we erheen toen ik later afstudeerde was scherpenisse de eerste gemeente die contact zocht met het oog op een beroep
7412714 ik ben heel voorzichtig om zoiets te zeggen maar we hebben daar echt iets van een opwekking meegemaakt vanaf de eerste zondag zat de kerk vol ook s middags dat was echt zeer ongebruikelijk toch is het zo gebleven dat zeg ik niet om mezelf nu eens flink op de borst te kloppen juist niet dat gaf de heere mensen wekten hun buren op om naar de kerk te komen het was een gezegende tijd en ik preek er nog ieder jaar twee keer met erg veel vreugde
7412715 de gemeente van elspeet hebben we zeven jaar gediend en ook daar zijn echt wonderen gebeurd in nederhemert was het trouwens niet minder goed
7412716 dat was best een hele overgang het was er weer heel anders dan in nederhemert en elspeet veertien jaar zijn we aan die gemeente verbonden geweest tien jaren voor de scheuring en vier jaren erna
7412717 die scheuring dat was echt de allerzwartste bladzijde uit mn ambtsbediening ik ben gezegend met een goede gezondheid heb nooit ambtelijk werk hoeven afzeggen maar toen was het eventjes helemaal op dat heeft me zo ongelooflijk aangegrepen van de ene op de andere zondag was ineens 40 procent van de kerkgangers er niet meer dat is zo ingrijpend ik heb de kerk in waarder na de scheuring nog n keer helemaal vol gezien en dat was tijdens mn afscheid dat doet pijn maar ook in waarder hebben we zegen mogen zien ook na de scheuring mochten we merken dat de heere nog onder ons wilde werken met zijn geest en is de band met kerkenraad en gemeente verdiept dat geeft verwondering
7412718 een bijzondere liefde heb ik voor het chinese volk sinds kort mag ik tot mijn vreugde lid zijn van het bestuur van de canadese amerikaanse tak van de bonisa zending
7412719 ik ben dan ook dankbaar dat ik de laatste tijd naast het gemeentewerk veel tijd mag doorbrengen in de gevangenis van grand rapids ik doe daar bezoekwerk bij de gevangenen en houd ook bijbelstudies met ze daarnaast preek ik soms onder daklozen
7412720 het was me in nederland nog nooit overkomen maar tijdens zon daklozenbijeenkomst werd er na de preek geapplaudisseerd ja dat gaat daar allemaal wat anders dan hier

7412753 by posting an average annual volume growth of nearly 50 year on year the mongolian business has established itself as one of the strongest performing operations globally i am also delighted to see that the leadership of mcs coca cola has continuously demonstrated its commitment to invest in the development of its people and manufacturing facilities critical to ensure continued future growth of the coca cola business in mongolia
7412754 with the burgeoning beverage market in mongolia we have recorded remarkable growth rates in 2002 we sold 4 coca cola products to every average mongolian consumer in 2008 we are selling an average of 67 beverages to every mongolian consumer this has caused our first plant to run out of manufacturing capacity 7 years ahead of schedule
7412755 we are greatly encouraged by the outstanding performance of our bottling operation as both the bottling company and the coca cola company have exceeded all projections of profitability and sales our investment in the new plant is just our first step to bring world class manufacturing to mongolia
7412756 i think now in my heart of the people who are close to me and especially the fans who came to china to cheer for me at the olympics
7412757 those things gave me the power to get the gold medal
7412758 this gold medal means a lot to my nation and to my people this gold medal belongs to all of them

7412890 the problem we have is that alot of our necessities arent met we need access to hospitalization for patients medications for the birthing materials sheets shelves jars alcohol to make plant tinctures plyers gloves stethoscopes and thermometers
7412891 we use pills from allopathic medicine but also plants we dont want to forget the knowledge and culture of our ancestors who cured themselves with plants thats why were organizing ourselves so we dont lose this knowledge and you should organize yourselves to take back your culture
7412892 in 1994 the insurgents came to live in this land and we brought them food in 1996 we had to go up into the mountains to live because the army came when we were up there we felt really sad because we didnt have a space to live in now we have a place for ourselves and our children to make ourselves at home to work the land
7412893 the plantation owner mistreated us we only had a little space to live in and the rest of the land was property of the owner he even took away our animals he didnt allow us to wash or bath in the river after alot of begging he let us use part of the river

7412895 59 of us went to various communities in were working on spreading information about the struggle in the communities learning from the compa eros in these communities our critique of ourselves and how to continue in solidarity with our compa eros zapatistas

7412897 46 of us went to oventik we went to the community of venustiano carranza in the in may 2007 they retook their land and so the government threatened to put them in jail issuing 11 orders of apprehension for defending their land on april 27th the police entered with the orders of apprehension they denied the people of access to their cornfield and now it is overgrown with weeds on july 18th the people returned to their land an the police arrested of of them a member of the other youth and so the people started a guard duty to protect themselves they sleep with the tension that the church bell will ring the signal that the police are coming there are also canadian mining companies who want to mine for gold in their land we shared alot with them learning he italians cooked pasta every night we have a piece of cruzton in our hearts and we hold on to it
7412898 in the past few years the government has tried to take the land away from us to sell and privatize the natural resources they already sold to coca cola they want to install a botelling factory to build a highway to unearth the mayan ruins and develop tourist projects foreigners have built their vacation homes 300 hectares live many indigenous communities 400 year old ancient trees drinking water for these communities and a neighbourhood in and 2 zapatista support bases in march 2007 the zapatistas created the civil camp for the peace to defend this land with the guard duty changing every week in the first few months people paid by the pri political party came to run the zapatistas out of the support bases and some pri supporters sold their land to the government there is still one group that receives money from the government and continues bothering the camp

7412901 im delighted to see mcs coca cola continue to exceed all projections in sales volume and profit
7412902 by posting an average annual volume growth of nearly 50 year on year the mongolian business has established itself as one of the strongest performing operations globally i am also delighted to see that the leadership of mcs coca cola has continuously demonstrated its commitment to invest in the development of its people and manufacturing facilities critical to ensure continued future growth of the coca cola business in mongolia
7412903 with the burgeoning beverage market in mongolia we have recorded remarkable growth rates in 2002 we sold 4 coca cola products to every average mongolian consumer in 2008 we are selling an average of 67 beverages to every mongolian consumer this has caused our first plant to run out of manufacturing capacity 7 years ahead of schedule
7412904 we are greatly encouraged by the outstanding performance of our bottling operation as both the bottling company and the coca cola company have exceeded all projections of profitability and sales our investment in the new plant is just our first step to bring world class manufacturing to mongolia

7412927 people just come to the mall to stay cool said chris balberona a driver for a bank who was at manilas megamall watching ice skaters on an artificial rink
7412928 life is hard right now so we dont really come here to shop
7412929 there has been no noticeable decrease in this number primarily because the malling lifestyle has become a way of life for the filipinos
7412930 if you have small kids of course you go to the mall
7412931 you want your kids to be happy because you hardly see them during the work week
7412932 its like they give you everything just so you go
7412933 before it was a regular family day for us to go to the malls even if we went there to just eat or walk around
7412934 now its really impossible even for that its just out of our budget
7412935 as the decision has been taken by all the members of the icc we welcome it we are not disappointed
7412936 we were backing pakistan but considering the situation we agree with the member boards but we continue to support pakistan
7412937 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7412938 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7412939 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7412940 since sri lanka had a colourful crowd it becomes difficult to spot the ball in the night specially after it ball becomes a bit dirty
7412941 the team was worried when jayawrdene and thushara were scoring runs
7412942 having a fifth bowler is a luxury we have to make do with four bowlers but we have bowlers like yuvraj raina and virat who can bowl we needed one extra batsman
7412943 earlier india had batsmen who could play till the end and i could go for big shots early i am however happy that i still have strike rate of 90 thougu i would have been happier to have a strike rate of over hundred
7412944 when you are scoring centuries you dont ask these questions every batsman has highs and lows the idea of playing sangakkara as opener is to have some senior batsman to get more balls to play
7412945 tough position to be in it is a challenging situation playing at home do not want to lose series we know where we are going wrong
7412946 all this division split in icc is far from the truth there were never such indications of racism at any position this was the unanimous decision of the board of icc that in my view went extremely well
7412947 the pcb will retain the hosting rights and we will attend to see what happens with safety and security and if that doesnt satisfy the icc we will make a decision to host it elsewhere with pakistan stripping the hosting rights
7412948 i certainly dont think so as there was a lot of goodwill expressed in that meeting today i understand that some of the boards wanted to discuss with pcb tours as soon as they feel a bit more comfortable to tour pakistan
7412949 we will meet in september we have got a scheduled meeting in september and we will discuss all the details and we will decide what it looks like in october 2009
7412950 so we were starting to feel uncomfortable that we will not be able to convince all of our member countries and players and those concerns would remain and it will not be the right time to stage a world class event
7412951 the change in plan happens after the presidents election was announced for early september so now the sports ministry has got approval to just have an ad hoc committee which will clean up the board affairs and prepare the ground for the new chairman
7412952 the ad hoc committee which is expected to be named this week will have at least three former test players and some government officials
7412953 the ad hoc committee will be there for just three months and will conduct a proper audit of accounts and look into the affairs of the affiliated associations review constitution before a new chairman is named
7412954 alright class may i have your attention we have a transferred student today and her name is yoshizawa hitomi please be nice to her
7412955 just call me yossie and the thing i hate the most is annoying people so dont bug me or ask any silly questions when its not needed
7412956 didnt i just say not to ask silly question and to answer your question its because i hate skirts
7412957 ok class settle down yossie please take a seat next to ishikawa rika shes sitting next to the window first row fourth seat
7412958 we heard that youre a talented detective and can break any case without a sweat in tokyo theres this ishikawa gang that has been smuggling in illegal cocaine and weapons and they made money through any illegal means
7412959 its easy to say that but we dont have any evidence everytime we sent spies they always end up missing or being killed so we want you to take this case
7412960 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
7412961 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death
7412962 even though ishikawa kazuko is a dangerous man but he has a daughter named rika and he loves her a lot she goes to an all school girl named gakuhou high school we want you to get close to her and if you have a chance then investigate her father
7412963 ill accept this case but i dont want to wear a skirt
7412964 dont worry about that we can ask a permission for you to wear pants by the way change your name to hitomi to hide your idenity
7412965 so thats rika behind a scary father theres a cute daughter how ironic
7412966 hmph you were lucky but this time i guess not
7412967 sensei why dont you become a karate master instead of a teacher
7412968 how dare you on your first day to fall asleep in class and even talked back to me i guess you have some guts yoshizawa no one in this school is dare enough to confront me except you
7412969 phew lucky its lunch time even though my karate is beyond a black belt but i wouldnt want to face her wrath dang her glare really scared the shit out of me
7412970 who is this girl ive never seen her before maybe shes a transferred student but shes really handsome and she has pants too
7412971 out of the way cant you see rika sama is here idiot
7412972 erika we have to teach these idiots a lesson not to get in way
7412973 even though you have a pretty face but deep down inside is rotten who do you think you are making everyone to get out of your way
7412974 who am i is none of your business even my father wouldnt dare to lecture me that
7412975 then ill teach you in place of your father i dont give a damn about your father spoiled you but if you bully people then ill stick my nose in it
7412976 really next time you should stand up against them bullies are coward once you fight against them
7412977 its ok im used to it she has a strong father behind no one dares to slap her like that
7412978 thats why you didnt know about rikas strong background avoid her next time when you see her im going back to my classroom thank you for saving me and im sorry for putting you in danger she might not leave you alone
7412979 dont worry about that and remember to treat your injuries
7412980 wow when did everyone leave so fast just then i saw a crowd and now theres no single soul here well except my soul
7412981 uso who would have thought a professional like you made a mistake
7412982 i slapped my target i was supposed to get close to her but now after this i think itll be hard to approach her
7412983 its rare to see you lose your coolness something must have pushed your anger button
7412984 i guess so by the way i need you to do my school homework
7412985 eh why its not my job and plus im already occupied with other jobs in place of you why do you care so much about homework when youre not a real school girl
7412986 its because my class has a devil teacher who likes to suck students soul whom doesnt do their homework
7412987 ill go pick up the call and make coffee for you
7412988 you bastard how dare you picked on my little precious sister
7412989 dont worry emiko theyre gone so stop crying onee san will always be there to protect you
7412990 emiko your older sister is useless i wasnt there to save you from your tragic death
7412991 some random client asked to find a lost dog so i refused since i know youre really busy
7412992 dont say that i want to bear your burdens for you as your best friend i was surprised that you decided to become a detective after your sisters sudden death
7412993 rika sama we should do something about that new girl i couldnt believe that she had a gut to slap you
7412994 we can hire someone to give her 10 times the pain that she inflicted on you
7412995 a jazz funk and blues feel with a rock edge

7413008 everyone here was in a state of shock when the news came through
7413009 la fragmentaci n de la madurez el gran cambio en la juventud ramos ntegros y el terror y el dolor del mundo nos penetraron por completo nos levant bamos por la ma ana siendo unos seres y por la noche completamente ahogados bajamos a un mar empu ando las estrellas y la fiebre del d a
7413010 los hombres que mi padre quer a eran blandos y adorables todos y cada uno se desvanecieron como brillante estrellas ante el sol se apagaron tranquila y catastr ficamente
7413011 una b veda de obscena angustia saturada de ngeles gusanos que cuelgan del tero ca do de un cielo en este ltimo cuerpo de la ballena el mundo entero se ha convertido en una pura llaga cuando la trompeta resuene de nuevo ser como apretar un bot n al caer el primer hombre arrastrar al siguiente y ste a otro y a otro y as a lo largo de toda la fila alrededor del mundo desde nueva york hasta nagasaki desde el rtico hasta el ant rtico
7413012 there has really been an unexpected and enormous amount of interest the whole year
7413013 at the beginning of the year my pet theory was the country was paying attention because it was trying to determine who it was going to vote for on super tuesday but with no resolution it has become like must see television like a sporting event and people have gotten hooked
7413014 i sent nbc universal sports amp olympics chairman dick ebersol an e mail in china congratulating him on the success of the olympics and noted what a great year it has been for sports
7413015 dick e mailed me back saying it all started with the super bowl on fox that makes you feel good and its good for our industry to see the kinds of numbers weve been getting
7413016 the nba on tnt enjoyed consistent ratings growth throughout our regular season and all the way through our exclusive coverage of the western conference finals
7413017 the bottom line for turner sports big brands and big markets translated into big numbers for us both on television and online
7413018 as a company two and a half years ago we invested billions of dollars in sports rights
7413019 we made that investment with the belief that as we move forward with more options for people and as the television universe gets more and more diverse the one segment of network television that would continue to be must see tv and would continue to deliver large audiences would be the major sports events because thats where the water cooler talk will be
7413020 there have been stories in sports this year that have been absolutely amazing and you couldnt even begin to make this stuff up
7413021 sports makes compelling tv and provides great storytelling for producers in the non scripted side of the business when you have authentic real competition like the olympics it can result in unbelievable numbers best of all sports is tivo proof you cant dvr sports
7413022 advertisers have cut back in a lot of media but i think television sports in general have come through in the past 12 months healthier than a lot of segments of the media although there is a concern going forward
7413023 this is the best job and the best contract ive ever had with espn
7413024 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover
7413025 we are not competing with revision3 or for your imagination
7413026 the competition is to convince advertisers to go with you instead of tv or instead of banner campaigns on yahoo i dont think any advertiser has created a dedicated budget for online video shows so you cant really compete with each other for money when the category doesnt exist yet
7413027 the beijing games have captured the publics imagination and their interest in the games is sparking very strong sales
7413028 people want to own a part of the games and what better way to remember the excitement than to have a collectible pin a dvd or a splashy windbreaker as seen on the athletes
7413029 for us this is a sign of the evolution of the channel that we are not dependent on other people in the industry anymore
7413030 we are now able to produce high level national programs for all of these entities and its a real statement of the level of confidence the industry has in us after all espn doesnt quietly give up production to people unless they have confidence in them
7413031 the new technology we are using changes how our analysts can call a match
7413032 with close ups of peoples feet and zeroing in on the ball they can now get detailed with the nuances of the game
7413033 our pre game show is going into its 15th year and while weve added elements through the years michael is the first analyst to be added to the main desk
7413034 there have been other opportunities over the years but they never felt right in michaels case however we think he is a wonderful fit for us as there is such a likability factor that was hard to resist
7413035 a lot of guys want to go to the studio when they finish their careers in the nfl because doing games is a challenge
7413036 but i spoke with mr billick and noted that if you look across all the networks and all of their game analysts only one former coach john madden is sitting in that seat and hes had a nice career
7413037 its the job ive always talked about wanting after my playing career inside the nfl
7413038 obviously bob is the host and hell deal with the big stories of the day along with cris
7413039 and dan and keith are going to do the highlights as they do better than anyone and tiki and jerome will work with cris and kind of tell you why it happened and why it should have happened or why it didnt happen so i think youve got a pretty good formula in the studio over the course of the 75 minutes theyre on where theres enough piece of the pie for everyone to excel
7413040 we did a lot of research during the offseason and heard time and time again that the monday night game is our fans prime time drama and we learned they want us to dig deeper and focus more on the nuances of the game
7413041 as we enter our third year we realized that while we took some risks there were some things that viewers didnt appreciate in the way we wanted and we decided to fix that and will now bring viewers right into the action with a special emphasis on ron jaworski
7413042 the trick with these cameras is to find a way to eliminate the blur without increasing the length of the replay
7413043 we think we found that balance at around 270 frames per second which benefits not only the officials but our analysts and viewers at home as well
7413044 everyone can expect a lot more of what weve been establishing since we launched which is more coverage and more opportunities to service this amazing fan base
7413045 there is such a hunger for this information and that was the basis for some of the really exciting things that we are going to be doing this year
7413046 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7413047 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7413048 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia
7413049 degrade and burn up on rentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
7413050 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station
7413051 while it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities nasa believes that it will be able to rely upon roscosmos provided soyuz vehicles for
7413052 as long as russia can be said to be abiding by the terms of the cease fire in georgia
7413053 there is an issue but i dont think its so strong to prevent the waiver from passing as long as russian behavior is what it has been agreed to on georgia
7413054 you have to make yourself a list of priorities you got the big man up top you got family you got school girls social life academics

7413061 fortunately im not on the brink so i dont think itll be a problem
7413062 ive got my first taste of blood and now im thirsty for more
7413063 you wont hear jerramy say any more about it the rest of the week which means he told stevens to keep his yap shut enjoy the game and remember that the dog has covered 4 straight super bowls with three of the last four decided by a field goal

7413070 we have asked all the owners just as a mark of respect that we make no movement of the horses until tomorrow
7413071 now has come the time for us to attack them and they will no longer attack us from now on it is we who will march onto them bukhari
7413072 the best of the people are my generation then those who come after them then those who come after them
7413073 of course we had discussions but after that sammy wrote i was in charge of correcting the spelling mistakes in english i dont know much english but i can spell
7413074 they couldnt keep up with him they couldnt find enough things to teach him
7413075 he said he got to see all the great operas at the met and didnt have to pay for one of them
7413076 he was never a man of means but he had a knack of always making sure we had what we needed
7413077 my vision of a green building at that point was dirt floors and straw walls and people walking around in birkenstocks and i dont know if they were singing kumbaya but they might have been
7413078 i had absolutely no idea what id committed to i knew i had committed to doing the right thing but thats as far as it went
7413079 its kind of like the ul label on an extension cord showing that some independent entity is saying a building works like it is supposed to
7413080 lets forget about any bank branch weve built in the past if we were designing a branch from scratch what attributes would it have and more importantly if our objective is to build the most affordable and most efficient green bank branch what would we do
7413081 and guess what it works just fine you really need to go back and challenge everything and realize that there is nothing thats sacred
7413082 in an office environment with the number of people who use a urinal
7413083 is there any chance its going to go two weeks before you get to the eighth flush no
7413084 only a couple manufacturers made low voc volatile organic compound paints now every major manufacturer makes low voc paints and you can buy them at home depot and lowes
7413085 when we built firstside there were only a couple of manufacturers making carpet that was environmentally friendly and there were only a couple of patterns available now every major commercial carpet company makes environmentally friendly carpet and there are thousands of patterns available
7413086 because the consumer has spoken theres tremendous consumer demand and thats going to continue
7413087 the class of 2012 has grown up in an era where computers and rapid communication are the norm and colleges no longer trumpet the fact that residence halls are wired and equipped with the latest hardware
7413088 it is a multicultural politically correct and green generation that has hardly noticed the threats to their privacy and has never feared the russians and the warsaw pact
7413089 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
7413090 the chickens have been here nine years and now theres this big thing about it
7413091 to get rid of the chickens how hard would it be to bring a cage put feed in it and catch them
7413092 my main fear is the diseases they carry because i have two small babies
7413093 if my babies get sick im going to kill the chickens
7413094 in the hot sun you know what rotten eggs smell like
7413095 they stop making noise at dark until 2 or 3 a m and at 4 oclock they are so loud you dont need an alarm clock
7413096 we are dealing with this in a humane way in an orderly fashion this is a legal place for government to step in

7413102 its been designed with kids in mind but a lot of parents and teenagers come through and learn about the science behind the sports that theyve been playing and watching for a long time
7413103 have you taken a pad and pencil and figured out how many times barack obama has flip flopped on iraq
7413104 im under oath today as a surrogate for john mccain to speak to you about this great american
7413105 too many people describe themselves as democrats or republicans but forget that were all americans
7413106 its more of a what the hell are you doing thing
7413107 he has no allegiance to the party he was once a part of
7413108 he says hes an independent but if you speak at the gop convention if you endorse mccain for president youre a republican end of story
7413109 watching joe lieberman go around the bend is one of the strangest things ive ever seen in politics
7413110 its like two quarter pound stools of alien space shit crashed into a toxic waste dumpster in stamford connecticut fucked and out came their mutilated blood soaked carcass of a baby rat child senator joseph lieberman
7413111 when they say a certain word you sip or you chug
7413112 like hope for obama and there will be references too if he implicitly compares himself to martin luther king sip chug if he does so explicitly
7413113 young professionals middle aged homosexuals and politically active elderly be quite a party
7413114 geared toward people who want to have drinks and watch the speeches and discuss
7413115 i spoke to the senate majority leader dean skelos and he agrees that collection of taxes from indians would help the shortfall in the budget
7413116 everybody talks about the weather we dont the writings of ulrike meinhof
7413117 education policy debates are dominated by a small number of very loud voices
7413118 ideological claims rather than research data the experience of educators and common sense are wielded as weapons
7413119 i didnt become an academic to talk to five guys in a room with transparencies
7413120 she doesnt come on as someone whos politicized but as someone whos using data to hold governments feet to the fire stuff i approve of theoretically
7413121 shes writing as if she wants the reforms that weve implemented and by extension the mayors tenure over education to fail
7413122 when it starts affecting other people it is a problem
7413123 theres no question about the quality of her work shes off the charts

7413143 what doug ruled at second base was even though a j did kind of stick his arm out to make contact aybar was still in his way so a j if he would have turned he wouldnt have been able to continue on to third
7413144 so after making the throw aybar is no longer in the act of fielding and he cant obstruct the runner which is what doug ruled happened
7413145 in a rundown even though a j was going back to second the rule of obstruction during a rundown is he gets his next advanced base and thats why he was rewarded third base

7413164 i love to read but i actually dont start my summer reading until late august i have found in the past that if i read them any earlier than august by the time that school starts i forget key points about the book so i actually dont think you are in that much trouble i would definitely recommend reading the kite runner ive heard its really good for your procrastinating problem read the books on any long plane rides or car rides you might have if you go on a vacation theres not really anything better to do during these long blocks of open time so its the perfect time to read
7413165 i know exactly how you feel like you i am going to be a 10th grader and i have been procrastinating a bit for summer reading i think that you should break everything into a schedule for example read your book for an hour then take a half an hour break then read again for an hour etc just take it one piece at a time and before you know it you will be done or sometimes the thing that gets me motivated is when i start thinking of the consequences just think if you dont start reading those books now you wont be able to read them in time for school your class may be having lectures and discussions about them and you will be left far behind get yourself motivated and get it done good luck
7413166 find something out that she loves to do and take her if she loves the beach have a picnic there or if she is competitive the bowling alley is always fun i would not necessarily recommend taking her to church for a first date but thats just me

7413202 and they were looking more into the fact that i may just disappear into america and work there illegally they were going from one idea or suspicion to another suspicion and were all over the place at one point they were almost arguing with themselves about what are we going to pin him on

7413217 it grew through the need to teach ict using something reliable
7413218 i feel we have better curriculum facilities than any school running windows and with far more reliability as part of our computing specialism we are doing a full network linux install in one primary school and we are trialling scholarpack in another

7413220 nur empfehlen schauen sie ihrer krankenkasse genau auf die finger und wechseln sie die kasse wenn sie mehr geld von ihnen verlangt
7413221 es stimmt aber auch dass die krankenkassen heute unterfinanziert sind in baden w rttemberg verlieren wir gute rzte die in die schweiz gehen weil sie hier nicht genug verdienen wenn man daran etwas ndern will dann kostet das geld
7413222 es besteht die gefahr dass eine solche ballung die kassen berlastet

7413229 workers are furious over this death and fed up with excuses from companies that dont make safety a priority
7413230 workers havent gone to work since the incident late saturday night and as of now it is not clear that things will be operating normally tomorrow monday
7413231 therefore as we ourselves when we have been engrafted into christ are righteous in gods sight because our iniquities are covered by christs sinlessness so our works are righteous and are this regarded because whatever fault is otherwise in them is buried in christs purity and is not charged to our account by faith alone not only we ourselves but our works as well are justified

7413238 i am sure the russians have left other surprises for us
7413239 they want to disrupt our life and our economy as much as possible
7413240 its been quiet where i was for the past two weeks but now i am worried even though i am happy to be back
7413241 i am afraid that what happened here with the russians will happen again
7413242 the situation in the black sea is tending to become more tense
7413243 nato countries are building up their naval presence to deliver humanitarian aid i do not think that this will contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the region
7413244 it is still not safe in certain other villages with high concentrations of cluster munitions
7413245 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7413246 so i ask you to work as hard for senator obama as you did for me
7413247 i know how hard farmworkers work and you worked hard for me in this campaign
7413248 i have campaigned with him for more than 16 months ive debated him and ive watched
7413249 ive seen his passion and determination his grit and his grace and i know that he has lived the american dream and now it is time for us to have a president again who believes that every person is entitled to be given the chance to fulfill his or her dreams and that is what senator obama will do as our president
7413250 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7413251 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7413252 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference
7413253 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7413254 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7413255 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7413256 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7413257 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7413258 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7413259 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7413260 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7413261 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7413262 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7413263 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7413264 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7413265 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7413266 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7413267 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7413268 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7413269 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games which includes a final propaganda push to legitimize chinas rule in tibet with tibetans singing and dancing along with other so called ethnic minorities

7413273 i just want to study and be with my mom
7413274 a lot of guys try to run the same game that they ran over there but they end up falling on their face
7413275 you see we know spanish but we dont know the exact words and when we try to explain to somebody something theyre like huh

7413285 when you get hurt and you get put on the 15 day disabled list thats one thing but when youre out a month or two months it kind of wears on you mentally
7413286 its kind of tedious and it can definitely play with your mind but ive been through enough now that i know what i need to do and thats to continue to get some at bats and keep getting better so i can come back up in september
7413287 the secret of success is to know gods word speak about it meditate on it and then above all do it in gods world there is no substitute for full obedience
7413288 one of the most extraordinary military commanders of all time
7413289 weve spent a great deal of time so far in the running game i think tatums bell really stood out as has brian calhoun real pleased with the running game and what were trying to do
7413290 tatum bell right now is a different level hes better than i thought hed be hes the whole package hes got so much juice to him he can go hes taken our offense and learned it so well he doesnt make any mistakes hes catching the ball extremely well hes playing at such a high level right now
7413291 jons kitna far enough along we could start tomorrow hes playing at such a high high level were trying to be careful with him when other guys are all aware of protections and routes and were just working through those things theres just nothing you can give him that he cant do right now
7413292 he does have really good accuracy and he fits well into the scheme of things you have to be doing things really good to be the leader of a mike martz offense
7413293 osullivan is capable of being a starter in this league hes not a reliever if you will hes not a backup hell take full advantage of the competition hes a very fierce competitor
7413294 im on hardcore freebase narcotics resulting in severe delusions of grandeur
7413295 if i can come in and we can win the super bowl thatll mean more than anything thus far in my life up to this point for us not to have been in the playoffs for a little bit of time now and for us to go straight to a super bowl my rookie year you cant ask for anything else
7413296 we have no other options at wide receiver so ill talk from my ass
7413297 he had an outstanding camp to start with he just became a new dad so a lot of outstanding things are happening in his life its good to see a guy come up big like that
7413298 i was told by a couple of the players that i need to be one of the leaders in the receiver room so thats where my focus kind of changed if i dont know where im going how the heck am i going to help somebody else
7413299 im a believer because hes desperate and im smoking some of his ganja
7413300 this year hes shown me hes recommitted and focused on becoming one of the elite backs again
7413301 he showed me that recommitment when he packed that bowl air tight
7413302 ricky has found a profound sense of inner peace through his yoga and zen practice he is a 31 year old running back with a 25 year old body that has avoided major wear and tear and at 231 pounds and sprinter speed let the nfl beware
7413303 we have no other options at wide receiver so ill talk from my ass
7413304 i want to see courtney touch the ball ben touch the ball i think theyre just as capable we have to sort that out so were going to kind of try and force feed that just a little bit to see how were going to line up the first game
7413305 if you cant ride a roller coaster youre better than everyone else
7413306 i told somebody one time if they started a league called the backyard league where you threw a football into the backyard and you let guys choose up teams and make their own rules and play football the first two guys i would choose on my team are steve tasker and doug flutie
7413307 they know how to play the game probably because they are small they have been forced to figure out ways to be good they dont need somebody to tell them what to do they would figure it out they would be inventive creative and be two of the best players in that league and i think justin is a little like that
7413308 in a sense you cant see them they are so quick and yet they are explosive
7413309 money amp run an action adventure serial for the stage
7413310 dans le cadre de sa premi re transaction avec la firme grecque
7413311 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7413312 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7413313 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7413314 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7413315 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7413316 recommends obtaining antioxidants from food sources and not from synthetic supplements
7413317 does not advise antioxidant supplements due to long term safety concerns and insufficient evidence to prove their effectiveness
7413318 there is no proof that antioxidants in pill form can improve your general health or extend your life in fact they can have the opposite effect
7413319 were very confident in the overall business mix that we have the diversity of geography and the diversity of industries that were in chief executive peter watson said in a telephone conference
7413320 to ensure we would be in a position to get the settings right and provide continuity during a difficult period
7413321 nothing changed expect to the extent that when we extended mikes contract we believed and we were absolutely right that we were entering a very difficult environment
7413322 we wanted to have the option of security of tenure we also wanted mike to get the setting right for us as we got into the storm
7413323 we believe weve probably passed through the eye of the storm
7413324 weve had that continuity and weve now come to an agreement with mike that he step down
7413325 i cant say that the markets are turning very quickly but were prepared for the environment were in

7413328 everyone knows legos sweet spot has always been with small children
7413329 lego had a huge hit with the mindstorms robotics program it was kind of natural for them to look for a way to bring that down to younger kids
7413330 i guess the thing i dislike most about business in general is the ultimate focus on the bottom line
7413331 im not really driven by profit of course its an important part of the business but its not the only part and its awful when things are compromised to preserve the bottom line
7413332 i think being a business owner is more about creating a positive force in the community a place where employees enjoy spending much of their lives
7413333 when people tell me how much they love their job thats what im in this for

7413352 when the class is over i say im going to step over all of the dead bodies
7413353 the demand has kind of grown on us as weve used every available space we have for the wellness programming
7413354 were using today some of our auditorium space for exercise programs in the morning because it is the only space we have that is large enough for people to stretch out and spread out and exercise
7413355 the people that come in we think generally will be more active and perhaps in better health than we were
7413356 in some regards the challenge to get more older adults active continues and of course its a problem for people of any age
7413357 i didnt know if i was going to live or die and i decided that i had always wanted to do something
7413358 it was a painful decision but some of our members were working
7413359 one was taking care of grandchildren and the ones who had been in it the longest were in their 90s it just reached the point that it was the thing to do
7413360 most of the women in the club had gardeners but we still came and actually pulled the weeds
7413361 we had some fabulous women in there when i was in i just cant tell you they were real community people louise sheehan dorothy schley annie b weigle i mean people who really knew about plants and loved augusta
7413362 mrs grover corrie ann maxwell was a member when i was in mrs elise morris they loved this town and they did a lot for the town we didnt do fabulous things but we did some things
7413363 we started a garden therapy program at the va hospital to help the men recover
7413364 we were the forerunners of this movement now about green space
7413365 they were wonderful women and we learned so much from them about gardening
7413366 we shared our plants my yard has never looked as good since
7413367 i probably work more at fishing than i do at the transmission shop
7413368 i leave the house at 3 a m and get on the water at 4 a m you really have to be on your toes to put fish in the boat every single day
7413369 you get the same license a charterboat captain in the ocean would use
7413370 you cant always make everyone happy but when you do its a lot of fun
7413371 ive learned people will travel further to catch a big bunch of crappie than stripers or hybrids
7413372 i dont usually have someone who just wants to spend some time on the water and relax i usually get four guys who put their money together and they want to catch their limits
7413373 you cant always make everyone happy but when you do its a lot of fun
7413374 if we had been incorporated the last time the local option sales tax was passed thats probably three quarters of a million dollars that would have been coming into this area
7413375 and state shared revenue thats 1 5 million that would be coming into a very small area that has really seen some hard times in the last few years with the loss of jobs we have experienced
7413376 but with a 5 mill tax youre looking at 20 to 40 a year
7413377 to me the future of this area is worth that kind of investment
7413378 its quite apparent that no one else is going to take care of this area
7413379 its up to us to take a stand and try to turn it around and make the area better than what its been in the past
7413380 it costs so much to go up the coast or to texas or something like that its come to a point where shows have to make sense both career wise and money wise weve had to cancel shows and it has always been because of gas prices
7413381 but unless its a show we just cant miss an amazing opportunity or something thats really important we are very careful about how we route
7413382 its much harder now especially on the west coast i mean in california it is ridiculous but there isnt much we can do about it i mean we cant consider stopping but it makes it much harder to make any kind of profit
7413383 yes we capitalize on those free continental breakfasts as much as we can
7413384 you are always aware and you are always trying to live cheaply getting the cheapest room eating frugally because the gas is going to be so expensive
7413385 still its really killing a lot of young bands that want to get out there and play
7413386 its almost the opposite of what happened with napster when young bands could get out and play and people could hear the music now people can hear the music but the bands cant get out there and play
7413387 15 years since we started the moscow times and i cannot imagine starting my day without the newspaper
7413388 i think pam needs to come clean as the video speaks for itself and that is evidence that a person cannot deny mr lazenbys longtime friend and spokesman michael sands said

7413393 typically most people in the dry ice business would say it has not been a growing business

7413415 defence spending has traditionally been concentrated around newcastle wollongong and the capital cities
7413416 increasing defence business across regional areas particularly northern inland nsw could have considerable economic impact
7413417 we are not necessarily talking about the provision of complete units and or national defence contracts smaller businesses can compete for sub contracts in many areas on local regional and national fronts
7413418 on a national level we could for example be talking about the provision or manufacturing of individual components
7413419 the forum will provide the details on how to compete for defence contracts

7413426 the findings show that australia is doing comparatively well in treating cancer but the outcomes are progressively poorer as distance from the city increases
7413427 around 57 per cent of people in outer regional areas are still alive five years after a cancer diagnosis compared with the national average of around 61 per cent a four per cent gap that translates to hundreds of individuals dying prematurely over a five year period
7413428 the outcomes are considerably poorer for people in more remote areas whose survival rates are around eight per cent lower than the national average
7413429 the most effective way to reduce the prohibitive distances faced by cancer patients in rural and remote areas is to bring services to the regions by establishing a network of regional cancer centres
7413430 located where the need is highest a network of multidisciplinary cancer centres could treat thousands of patients in outer regional and remote areas dramatically reducing the distance hundreds of patients would need to travel each year and easing pressure on metropolitan centres that currently care for rural and remote patients

7413456 ondanks de grote vraag naar het trappistenbier van westmalle hebben de monniken opnieuw besloten om de productie niet te verhogen het bier van de trappistenorde in het belgische westmalle is in trek in binnen en buitenland al jaren geldt een productiebeperking van het trappistenbier recent heeft de orde bekeken of de productie toch niet zou kunnen worden uitgebreid opnieuw is echter besloten niet meer bier te gaan brouwen minder aanbod en een hogere vraag leiden tot een hogere prijs maar aan het besluit van de monniken ligt geen economische reden ten grondslag om het geld is het de monniken niet te doen de bewoners van de abdij van onze lieve vrouw van het heilig hart van westmalle vinden dat een productieverhoging te veel investeringen zou eisen nog belangrijker is echter dat de verhoging een grote invloed zou hebben op het persoonlijke leven van de werknemers broeder benedikt geeft in een verklaring aan dat de orde er veel waarde aan hecht de menselijke maat te behouden bij het brouwen van het trappistenbier we zouden ook een extra ploeg kunnen inzetten of overwerk toestaan maar daar zijn we niet voor we vinden het belangrijk dat onze lekenmedewerkers op een redelijk uur naar huis kunnen gaan zodat er tijd rest voor hun familiale en sociale leven we willen ook het persoonlijke contact behouden met deze mensen en dat is bij een schaalvergroting misschien niet meer mogelijk de monniken accepteren dat de productiebeperking gevolgen zal hebben voor de beschikbaarheid van het bier maar hopen dat probleem zo eerlijk mogelijk op te lossen af en toe komt een verdeelpunt tijdelijk zonder voorraad te zitten volledig buiten de wil om van de handelaar of de winkelketen om dit zo veel mogelijk te vermijden verdeelt de trappistenbrouwerij het beschikbare bier op een eerlijke en billijke manier zowel over grote als kleinere distributiepunten aldus de orde
7413457 dat is nu eens en goed bericht en een voorbeeld van good practice ik

7413463 the restaurant is just down the street from the police post that was blown up
7413464 his office is across from the courthouse you know the one where that attack happened
7413465 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7413466 they are searching their handbags and their pockets for every single coin i look away when this happens
7413467 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home
7413468 i sit out on the roof until the light fades too much for me to read anymore i want to become educated and better myself but it is very hard
7413469 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7413470 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7413471 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7413472 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you
7413473 one to america one to canada two more to the u k
7413474 its not just whatever hardship they are experiencing at the moment

7413476 perguruan tinggi di indonesia yang umumnya memiliki visi menjadi perguruan tinggi kelas dunia world class university terus didorong oleh pemerintah melalui direktorat jenderal pendidikan tinggi oleh karena itu workshop ini penting bagi perguruan tinggi di indonesia hal ini juga memanfaatkan momentum peningkatan anggaran pendidikan mulai tahun 2009 menjadi 20 dari total anggaran apbn
7413477 workshop ini membahas tentang beberapa hal penting yang harus diketahui oleh perguruan tinggi antara lain metodologi perankingan baru yang dilakukan oleh qs data collection strategi untuk mendapatkan ranking peran kualitas dan kuantitas penelitian di perguruan tinggi dalam perankingan

7413479 for this hard core muslim religious policeman who was in charge of enforcing islamic code in saudi arabia for his own daughter to become a believer in christ obviously he felt such shame brought on his family that it was better to kill her than to live with that shame
7413480 if youre able to kill your family member before that conversion process is complete youre actually doing them a favor because theyre still going to die a muslim theyre still going to have some chance of going to muslim paradise after death
7413481 the internet becomes a source of information and ultimately a source of ministry that says there is something else out there theres jesus christ and the hope the assurance of eternity with him and that speaks very loudly to the muslim heart
7413482 radio is by far the most important most used and most trusted medium of communication people use it both for accessing information and for entertainment radio is an indispensible tool for learning about dangers to the community and fueling the daily conversations that most people carry on in an oral society
7413483 there are many opportunities for the church in africa to reach out to people capitalizing on its reputation as a significant guarantor of peace in conflict torn areas and providing new opportunities for people the expectations of the church are much higher than for islamic mosques and witchdoctors
7413484 some of the dormitories that burned had students in them and some were killed this became very disturbing to the government the political leaders and the older generation they couldnt understand why
7413485 the young people are seeing hypocrisy theyre seeing abuse and inconsistencies in the older generation and its creating a great turmoil among the younger generation
7413486 the practices of many of the churches have not kept pace with the changes in the thinking of the young people its not a case of changing the gospel but changing the way its presented to the new generation it has to be relevant to them
7413487 we interviewed 4 000 students in kenya and were just in the process of tabulating the results of that we feel that this turmoil is just accentuating the need for our ministry theres no question jesus christ is the only answer
7413488 we are doing a lot of field research to document what we call our spiritual engagement with students are they reading our materials are they remembering it we are constantly tweaking our materials so that we are relevant to where the students are
7413489 we are partnering with 20 or 25 different organizations we will share the results of our research with all of those organizations and coming out of that we go through a process of strategic planning

7413497 when i was growing up i felt the dragons were my family
7413498 but today the dragons are angry with us and see us as enemies
7413499 for us giving food to the dragons is an obligation our sacred duty
7413500 we dont want the komodo dragon to be domesticated its against natural balance
7413501 we have to keep this conservation area for the purpose of wildlife it is not for human beings
7413502 if we let the locals hunt again the dragons will be gone
7413503 if we are not strict in enforcing the ban everything here will be destroyed
7413504 people are scared because every day the dragons come down and eat our goats
7413505 today its a goat and tomorrow it can be our child
7413506 we threw branches and stones to drive him away but the dragon was crazed with blood and just wouldnt let go
7413507 i dont blame the dragons for my boys death i blame those who forbade us from following custom and feeding them
7413508 if it werent for them my boy would still be alive
7413509 shouldnt have crouched like a prey species in a place where dragons live
7413510 youve got to be very careful about extrapolating and drawing any conclusions
7413511 any concern expressed by the villagers will be taken seriously and we will address it if we can
7413512 the smell of the village goats chicken drying fish all this invites the dragons
7413513 and if the dragons cant grab the animals they will bite the villagers
7413514 shouldnt have crouched like a prey species in a place where dragons live
7413515 the offender just got out of the car after it fully sunk and swam across over to the rock on to the wharf came up on top of the wharf and he thought it was you know a joke and he just laughed it off

7413592 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7413593 this is the rainy season for florida so most likely they are going to see rain
7413594 the water had no where to go it went into the rivers and now its going to take a lot of time for that water to run through the system
7413595 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7413596 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7413597 its easy and somebody could learn an entirely different language
7413598 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7413599 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7413600 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7413601 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7413602 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7413603 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7413604 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7413605 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7413606 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7413607 we basically took the front of the school off we needed to create a security entrance where we could screen visitors
7413608 its really what goes on inside the school we had a family feeling before with great teachers and that wont change
7413609 and were increasing the bandwidth to 100 megabytes from four
7413610 its all about enhancing communication thats one of the goals this year
7413611 all too often innocent law abiding people suffer tragic consequences and the loss of loved ones due to this careless disregard for human life
7413612 because we are committed to ending the carnage we are intensifying enforcement during the crackdown we will be especially vigilant during high risk nighttime hours when impaired drivers are most likely to be on our roads
7413613 both the inspector and the actual construction company neither of them did their jobs correctly
7413614 consequently now we are in a situation where our kids have been put in harms way since the day the door opened in 2003
7413615 i think for the amount of money that the taxpayers are putting out the inspection process by the regional board is abysmally inadequate
7413616 so you need to have a process whereby somebody is assisting the districts
7413617 we have encouraged all of our school districts to hire this third party person who will be on the job every day while the building is being built
7413618 it isnt that we do solely the inspection by ourselves i dont think you can blame any one source for this happening
7413619 if people do what they are supposed to do then there arent problems and there are safeguards in place
7413620 the safeguards failed until fault is determined we cannot comment on what we know or dont know about the construction and inspection process because thats a subject of ongoing litigation
7413621 the community is right to be angry about it and the lawsuit will determine where the fault is going to lie
7413622 when there are problems with a project the advantage in that situation is you only have to go back to the general contractor to determine liability versus having to figure out which subcontractors are liable
7413623 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7413626 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7413627 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7413628 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7413629 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7413630 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7413631 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7413632 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7413633 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7413636 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7413637 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7413638 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7413639 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7413640 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7413641 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7413642 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7413643 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7413644 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7413645 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7413646 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

7413649 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7413650 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

7413657 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7413658 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7413659 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7413660 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7413661 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7413662 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7413663 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7413664 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7413665 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7413666 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7413667 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7413668 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7413672 although feeling and thought define the architecture of experience it is what i take keown to be arguing here is that
7413673 accordingly he buddha laid down only five groups because it is only these that can afford a basis for the figment of an ego or of anything related to an ego
7413674 the psychosomatic that said it is important to consider further what keown means by the term
7413675 the experience of vi n naa na in this form as consciousness is merely one of its many modes it is better understood as functioning at a deeper level and underlying all the powers of an organism
7413676 spiritual principle in man which organizes sustains and activates his physical components
7413677 as the carrier wave of a persons moral identity in the stage of transition between one life and the next i t may be referred to as spirit an alternative designation for
7413678 strictly speaking the duration of the life of a living being is exceedingly brief lasting only while a thought lasts
7413679 in the overwhelming majority of cases individual life is generated through sexual reproduction and begins at fertilization
7413680 the material basis for life to arise on its own
7413681 from the standpoint of buddhist doctrine it would seem impossible for it to develop very far
7413682 that if consciousness were extirpated from one still young then normal growth and development could not continue
7413683 yes we should always avoid the ending of a life no matter how insignificant it may seem
7413684 when the groups appear to view we use the phrase a living being
7413685 one should not take the view that it is ashes
7413686 maximize opportunities with social media and build relationships with online brand advocates
7413687 we fundamentally have many common problems at transportation agencies but also solutions that can come out of a strong underpinning of technology
7413688 all of us have a strong desire to make public transit as easy and safe to use as possible and to improve our multimodal transportation picture
7413689 i called aurora to dispatch an ambulance and firetruck to get there but they couldnt either
7413690 they think its safer to personally give me their credit card number but i always tell them the truth entering your credit card number into the web sites payment gateway is always safer
7413691 so i the seller never see the full payment information from the customer all i see are the last four digits of the credit card number in an e mail confirmation from the bank and then within two business days the bank deposits the money into my account
7413692 really its more risky to hand your credit card to a waiter than it is to enter the information into a secure web payment site
7413693 you play with people who are better than you equal to you and worse than you you have to make it all work together

7413696 several districts are receiving continuous rains for the past month and a half
7413697 nearly 750 000 people are reeling under the impact of the floods
7413698 the river banks are now swamped and we are ready to plug any breach that may occur in the anti flood embankments
7413699 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7413700 ongoing efforts to create positive and lasting peace in the region and progress toward the shared goal of a peace agreement in 2008
7413701 its going to be great especially since my son and summer are very close
7413702 its just really good that everyone took care of her the way they did
7413703 this guy is a marine and hes been serving our country
7413704 when you think about all these guys are doing its the least we can do to give some of our time whether you agree with the war or not you have to support the troops
7413705 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7413706 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7413707 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7413708 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7413709 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7413710 there seems to be a sense of urgency we have had a couple of weeks that were not so good
7413711 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7413712 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard and theyve got to do more to complete the task of definition both definition of him as well as definition of john mccain
7413713 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers this is a big opportunity for him
7413714 i have a lot of doubts that this convention is going to be as persuasive as it should be because theyve got this damn thing with hillary
7413715 i love hillary i was for her but this is the worst political decision i could imagine this is supposed to be an obama celebration youre going to get the nomination of someone who came very close to winning and youre going to get a lot of people in there cheering and hollering and some people booing
7413716 how did we get all of robert e lees stuff from his son
7413717 how did we get all of stonewall jacksons stuff from his widow
7413718 i think it is critical for the telling of the history of the united states that the valuable moc collection is preserved
7413719 certain groups are unable to draw a distinction between a museum for the confederacy as opposed to a museum of the confederacy
7413720 there are very few people who are willing to face the controversies of the civil war and we do
7413721 at each site we have an unbelievable historic place a bunch of themes to explore
7413722 i think in practical terms getting the artifacts out there is the right move
7413723 i dont think people should be put off by whats here
7413724 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7413725 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7413732 my grandmother was a rockette she had a dance studio in her basement i would go down into her basement whenever we would visit she would have classes going on and there would be mats i would stretch on the mats
7413733 i want to do gymnastics i want to go to the olympics i want to win the gold medal
7413734 it was the highest energy competition ive ever been in
7413735 ended up getting back on track finishing the routine and sticking the dismount selling it to the judges like this was the best routine id ever done though i knew id made a major break in the middle of the routine
7413736 once you get that your job is to train for the olympics
7413737 i coached gymnastics while i was in high school to put gas in my car
7413738 i thought she was the most beautiful girl id ever seen
7413739 i always wanted to date her but she always had a boyfriend
7413740 if i had made the team in 1996 then i dont think wed be together
7413741 went crooked missed the mat and hit my head on the basketball floor there was a seizure i was out cold
7413742 my air awareness was off i could not make 10 circles in a row on the pommel horse
7413743 once you lose that edge it is time to retire from the sport
7413744 that was a lot to ask of my wife and i still hadnt proven myself in diving like i had in gymnastics
7413745 it was horrible but thats how we promoted the newsletter
7413746 it was from the heart of the sport the athletes
7413747 this is what i know and i wanted to stay involved in the sport
7413748 just like youtube but you dont have to filter through all the trash it is just gymnastics
7413749 i like to look back and remember some of the things i did but some of it is painful too
7413750 we have these two young enthusiastic coaches who are passionate about football
7413751 they work well with the kids and football is in their blood
7413752 its really fun you get to see stuff from a different aspect when youre a coach
7413753 we feel like were trying to change the atmosphere here were putting in what we did in college and were starting to see it trickle down
7413754 weve made the schedule this year to hopefully get us ready for that
7413755 theres a lot of great history there with westside and theyve been great to us i cant wait for it
7413756 should be one of the better quarterbacks in the area
7413757 its hard to win one in a row its hard to win golf tournaments
7413758 he kind of turned it on in the last few tournaments when he needed to
7413759 its a big weight off my shoulders to tie the record
7413760 everybodys been asking me when i was going to do it it didnt come easy there is a lot of good competition out there
7413761 id gotten used to winning but it takes a lot to win its got to be your time and place
7413762 if it kills me im going to get that putting straightened out

7413772 quer an reducir el problema de tibet a una discusi n de mi situaci n personal
7413773 piensan que simplemente recitar unas mantras hacer visitas sucesivas a los templos prostrarse y llevar una rueda de oraciones y un rosario es suficiente para practicar la religi n as que superficialmente hay libertad de religi n pero los chinos simplemente no entienden que es necesario tener un maestro adecuado estudiar a fondo y practicar seriamente en el lugar apropiado
7413774 en realidad buscamos un camino intermedio en muchas ocasiones he dicho que los l mites humanos siempre est n cambiando en ciertas circunstancias he explicado que dos naciones pueden combinarse en una naci n as que te ricamente nosotros los tibetanos apenas unos seis millones de habitantes podemos sacar m s beneficio uni ndonos a los mil millones de chinos que convirti ndonos en un pa s independiente
7413775 la posici n oficial del gobierno en el exilio y del dalai lama como se reafirm en la declaraci n de estrasburgo del 15 de junio de 1988 es llegar a un arreglo con china
7413776 hacia fines de 1978 cuando deng xiaoping surgi como el m ximo dirigente en pek n el gobierno comenz a fomentar m s el desarrollo como l der de una facci n m s moderada su ascenso parec a se alar verdadera esperanza para el futuro siempre pens que un d a deng har a grandes cosas para su pa s cuando estuve en china en 1954 5 me reun varias veces con l y me hizo muy buena impresi n nunca celebramos largas conversaciones pero o decir muchas cosas buenas de l especialmente de que era un hombre de gran capacidad y muy decisivo tambi n la ltima vez que lo vi me dio la impresi n de que era un hombre muy poderoso ahora empezaba a parecer que adem s de esas cualidades era tambi n muy sabio
7413777 se han presentado momentos en que yo tambi n hubiera preferido luchar pero debemos ser realistas hemos tenido malas experiencias y hemos sido abandonados no quiero hablar de esto ahora es cosa del pasado pero sigue viva en nuestra memoria
7413778 en nuestro caso la violencia es m s bien suicida no tiene nada de pr ctico aunque 10 000 j venes exilados y cientos de miles de j venes en tibet se alzaran en armas juntos seguir a siendo muy dif cil los chinos nos pueden aplastar f cilmente hasta la guerra de guerrillas es muy dif cil pienso que podemos llegar a una especie de acuerdo que nos beneficie mutuamente
7413779 well its the 60s and everyone was into a lot of weird stuff back then then too youre talking about california right
7413780 the following takes place between 1 00pm and 2 00pm on the day of the california presidential primary
7413781 the liberals are constantly shortening in the betting as perception of their position improves they are now rated as a 3 80 chance by punters in from the 4 50 they were at the start of the campaign
7413782 the whole business plan for this was set up when we only had one competitor comcast and weve been successful to date with that plan
7413783 but now theres a whole new marketplace and we shouldnt necessarily be following the same plan
7413784 i think theyre right that somebody should be paying more attention to this
7413785 weve been doing a good job of that but not a great job this is a big business for the town and we need to make sure were paying close attention to it
7413786 the medical examiner waits for all the tests even ones we would presuppose a certain way to come back before issuing a report
7413787 during the course of the investigation we determined that a drug transaction had in fact taken place officers then arrested two individuals one being keith eppich
7413788 ill just confirm that he was arrested i havent talked to him
7413789 at the same time of course the legal system has yet to play itself out on the matter
7413790 currently we have the ability to test firefighters for just cause
7413791 whether a more broadly administered drug testing policy will be implemented is a matter for collective bargaining
7413792 i think its a great accomplishment he had everyone talking about it
7413793 he has achieved more than any other swimmer we have to give him that
7413794 i love watching his races because its fun seeing him do his thing and he always does his best
7413795 he just shows if you really want something and you put your mind to it you can do it
7413796 they can bend and twist in ways that even 16 year olds cannot
7413797 it was hotter than heck there humid like pea soup
7413798 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7413799 communication is absolutely essential which is why these fundraisers are so important
7413800 the phone cards are a huge help and something that guys of my era didnt have i went a year without hearing my mothers voice and that type of thing can make a big difference
7413801 there are a lot of groups the military family support group the rotary club the legion and others who send stuff overseas a few times a year but family members are always sending stuff off and this is a way to help defray those costs
7413802 it can get expensive for families plus although getting phone cards and sunscreen and lotion and all that is nice its not as nice as getting moms apple pie or something from home
7413803 im sure there were people who wanted to contribute but didnt get the chance or just couldnt for whatever reason
7413804 this is a chance to come out as a town and for everybody to see how much we support our troops therell be no solicitations or anything like that just come on out and have some fun
7413805 the basic message is we ended up in a positive situation
7413806 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
7413807 as libertarians have long pointed out both the welfare state and the warfare state have brought immeasurable damage to our country
7413808 thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges
7413809 maybe that labyrinth held clues to another client or another rogue state
7413810 and were not going to rest until you are stopped
7413811 what message does that send when you try to recruit other informants
7413812 detailed construction plans for nuclear weapons for gas ultracentrifuges for the enrichment of weapons grade uranium as well as for guided missile delivery systems
7413813 under all circumstances this information was not to reach the hands of a terrorist organization or an unauthorized state
7413814 we could have respected the treaty by avoiding their publication and putting them under lock and key
7413815 if they had kept the material in federal possession for years why not keep holding it
7413816 the newspapers know more about these things than i do
7413817 no answers to the really interesting questions in this case
7413818 mccain met for one hour from about 4 pm to 5 pm in a private meeting attendees undisclosed at the ritz carlton near his condo he emerged and drove right back to his condo and the pool departed for day no vips were sighted with him
7413819 jonathan martin mccain attends private off schedule meeting in phoenix
7413820 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7413821 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7413822 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7413823 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7413824 oh he has a woman as vp he must be pro choice
7413825 everyone knows it hes said it hundreds of times its not news
7413826 what de villiers fails to grasp is that his talented group of players find a sense of security in structure
7413827 other than white hating vengeful blacks who will gleefully contribute to the destruction of anything that was created by white people
7413828 the european teams must be laughing at us not being able to foot with the aussies and the abs
7413829 mediocre all blacks and wallabies teams have surpassed the boks on the world rankings an unforgivable occurrence when you consider that on paper the south africans have no peer
7413830 should current prices continue at these levels then the fair value adjustment will reverse in the period to 31 december 2009
7413831 when we prepared the prospectus forecasts we expected to win the electrical contract at cape lambert and boddington we were successful with cape lamber and missed out the boddington contract
7413832 in terms of timing the forecasts assumed the cape lambert project would ramp up during the third quarter and be completed during december 2008 actual ramp up occurred between june and august instead with no change to the expected completion date
7413833 these two challenges were partially offset by above expectation revenues from overseas projects and some small projects in australia
7413834 this created an artificial situation where livestock producers were essentially being subsidized by the government and there was a lot of abuse of the program by feed millers
7413835 the government has been discussing turning barley imports over to the private sectors for years because the current system was becoming increasing inefficient
7413836 in the best case situation corn imports have the potential to double from 650 000 metric tons 25 6 million bushels to 1 3 million tons 51 1 million bushels he said
7413837 local traders are more realistic and projecting that corn imports will grow significantly in the first year but the complete transition from barley to corn sorghum or co products will take a few years as traditional livestock producers adjust their formulas to the new prices realistically you will likely see tunisias corn sorghum and co products imports increase by 200 000 to 300 000 metric tons and most will likely go to corn
7413838 as we go forward all grains will now compete on an equal basis rather a preferential governmental program creating a much more dynamic livestock industry in tunisia
7413839 we are working to increase the presence of ddgs in swine feed rations right now most taiwanese hog farmers are only including 3 to 7 percent ddgs in their feeder pig rations our intent is to increase that inclusion rate to 20 percent
7413840 we also want to see hog farmers begin incorporating ddgs in sow rations which is not currently happening at most operations
7413841 there is a lot of false information being disseminated in taiwan about the presence of mycotoxins in u s ddgs a lot of this misinformation is coming from additive companies trying to steer end users away from ddgs in order to sell their own feed additives
7413842 the fact of the matter is ddgs coming from the u s contain very little to no mycotoxins we are trying to get the truth out there
7413843 the councils staff and consultants in taiwan forecast the potential market for ddgs in taiwan to be about 700 000 metric tons per year
7413844 this not only includes about 600 000 tons for the swine industry but also 100 000 tons for dairy poultry and aquaculture annually
7413845 ddgs is proving to be of extreme benefit especially to aquaculture farms raising tilapia and catfish
7413846 it has been a very positive development and is expected to be even greater in the future
7413847 if you do the trial and prove the results that can convince those directly involved with the project but not necessarily other farmers and feed millers
7413848 as a corn grower i am encouraged by the relationships the u s grains council has established as a basis of trade and future market share for my corn
7413849 the vietnam market is emerging as a market with great potential for u s corn and ddgs
7413850 no visites la morada del pr jimo cuando haya llegado la hora de su ruina
7413851 this is the most extensive set that has ever been used at the palace theatre as well as the most extensive one used by the lake plains players
7413852 there are nine openings and part of the humor of the show is people keep going in and out of the doors
7413853 youre supposed to be watching a play when the show begins and all of a sudden the character breaks and starts talking to herself and the director in the audience begins talking and it turns into a play rehearsal
7413854 everything gets funnier as it progresses because the show and all the people are falling apart
7413855 its amazing one of the best plays ever what makes it fun is nobody has ever heard of the show there was a movie with john ritter christopher reeve and carol burnett but the show is much funnier
7413856 it just so happened that the palace was free so we could build this large set
7413857 everything worked out my son was home on break we had the palace this is a dream come true for the lake plains players
7413858 i love british farce ive done a few before i think its going to come together nicely in this show im playing lloyd the director the one who comes close to having a nervous breakdown
7413859 its just about the same size but a few buildings are missing the fires burned them down there was more business in barker then than there is now
7413860 they told us they were poison but they tasted good
7413861 of course ive been eating them for 80 years i think most of the maraschino cherries are made in canada because they can get away with the chemicals they cant get away with here
7413862 it was a beautiful day for it people were in and out
7413863 the soap is wonderful for anyone with serious skin conditions
7413864 when they were younger they used to run the produce stand
7413865 it means a lot to get together with other growers
7413866 we cry on each others shoulder and discuss what chemicals are working the markets are changing tremendously
7413867 illiteracy equates poverty and health and injury and crime and so many other things teen pregnancy domestic violence and a host of other social ills of which illiteracy is both a cause and an effect

7413983 state labor is sending very confused messages about our call for a commonwealth games bid in 2018
7413984 one minute its too expensive the next minute they have not ruled it out this is very similar to their reaction to our call for a desalination plant later they were building it
7413985 we havent considered it at this stage but that doesnt mean to say we may not do so in the future
7413986 we havent done the costings and before we would make any announcement of this kind we would do the costings
7413987 our costings will be provided in detail well before the election for all to see

7413993 this win was a good start for our team but we know we can play much better defensively
7413994 we showed some nerves early in the game but our players responded positively and we finished strong

7413997 at every turn ua students undergraduates graduate students and professional students are part of that incredible process of discovery
7413998 so you can imagine with justifiable pride the ua calls itself a student centered research university this isnt an empty slogan its phrase that defines our culture at the ua we always see the student at the center of our work
7413999 we can appreciate what its like getting students oriented to student life and in paying tuition

7414006 theres a lot weve done in terms of writing in district over the summer
7414007 our goal is for bedford students to be as good at writing as they are at reading and math

7414010 say you are hospitalized for pneumonia and released but two weeks later you die in a car wreck
7414011 if you are a regional referral center they may have bigger challenges
7414012 the mortality data also offers clinicians and hospitals new insights into opportunities to improve care
7414013 a key point to keep in mind is that the mortality measure is just one piece of information about the care hospitals provide
7414014 they way i look at these ratings is that they allow us to ask questions but they may not necessarily provide answers
7414015 ports front office is now staffed with a new chief executive a new financial officer and assurances commercial chief steve olech and football chief peter rohde will stay at alberton

7414019 i dont know whats going on behind the scenes but i know people treat me with decency and respect i never had anyone abuse me
7414020 were thankful that their problems have not affected all of the residents but its a dangerous and fatal situation to be in waiting and wondering which resident could potentially be next
7414021 we have to act the way we do to ensure another family member doesnt have to endure the grief or trauma other families have been through
7414022 its almost like theyre picking you to shreds for no reason
7414023 to me its an insult to get a provisional license it used to be they were just for bad homes now i dont know
7414024 if theres a way for us to work with the facility to fix whatever problem so we dont have to remove people then we will do that
7414025 but if its a systemic problem we have to get residents out
7414026 we met with our residents to see if they had anything as other abuse to report
7414027 we sent letters to every family asking about awareness of issues and said if they had future suspicions we need to know there was not one call that came in
7414028 i think theyre on a witch hunt to close them down because of past activities
7414029 i only know them as reputable people who want to serve these elderly adults
7414030 the difference you see here is its family run so you see more love and caring going into it
7414031 with 90 percent of these employees there is no better but wherever you go youre going to get a couple of misfits

7414036 they keep putting fingers in the dike when are they going to get to the core operations of the sea and the convention center
7414037 i hate to be so blunt i fear unfortunately that if they go back there and get money its going to come at the expense of a lot of cultural and educational groups that are delineated in rad funding
7414038 because it wasnt part of the original list for funding i dont know that its fair to say that its not a regional asset i think it clearly meets the definition of a regional asset which makes it eligible for funding
7414039 it was not ever assumed that the convention center would be one of the regional assets
7414040 our objective is to maximize the usage of the building and minimize the deficit
7414041 i think we can safely assume there will be no significant growth in revenue if you look at the projections through the early parts of 2009 theyre generally pessimistic about economic activity

7414052 there are people who are in nursing homes who really dont need that much care but thats all thats available
7414053 some of the residents have already volunteered to hold classes to teach other residents who may not know computers too well
7414054 when i got sick about four years ago i felt so useless and everything i was used to being able to do for myself and my kids was gone
7414055 we have residents who are going back to college because were giving them back their freedom by taking away some of their burdens of life
7414056 but when will there be policy changes when these young people can live with neighbors who are not disabled too
7414057 a lot of these places are classified differently so its not something everyone with medicaid can access
7414058 im the first person to admit that no matter how you are people want options
7414059 you find other people who are in your situation and exchange ideas and information its nice that i can share stories with people who have gone through some of the same experiences or can help because theyve experienced some of the same things

7414065 it is the dedication of board officials such as those at the butler county board of elections who went above and beyond the call of duty that gives me confidence that preparation with our local partners will lead to a successful november election

7414087 there is no possible treaty between the swede and france that we could describe as satisfactory not so much because the swede is the great satan that is what the
7414088 but because peace in france any peace on any terms means that richelieu will get a second chance to entrench his rule even if stearns prevails on gustav adolf to offer france more lenient terms we will be opposed
7414089 is a coordinated operation europe wide one that will backlash on richelieu since everyone will blame him for it
7414090 in that matter at least guillaume has shown himself to be effective our treasury is refilling rapidly
7414091 other than persuading wealthy men to contribute by whatever means what can he do though in frankfurt that is
7414092 guillaume has demonstrated his unswerving loyalty by adhering faithfully to the orders i gave him before we left he should be rewarded for this not condemned i shall appoint him as my coordinator for all actions within the united states of europe
7414093 unquestioning obedience especially when it goes contrary to a mans own instincts is a rare quality it should be rewarded
7414094 you must write to guillaume you must explain to him that while his decision concerning the dreeson woman and the stone boys was correct we must conduct another assassination several assassinations probably
7414095 but they must be major actions of true political significance designed in such a way that richelieu will be blamed for them
7414096 assure him that he and the other men in frankfurt will play a major role in regard to the portion of our great plan that will unfold in the united states of europe they will have the honor of planning and carrying out the deaths of michael stearns and rebecca abrabanel
7414097 and of wilhelm wettin all on the same day for maximum effect in magdeburg the so called imperial capital in front of one of the spectacular if as yet unfinished new buildings there is no reason for us to carry out picayune little actions against people who are in the great picture insignificant as for the stones yes in rome they did us a great disservice but their time will come after we have achieved our greater goals
7414098 were not going to find him if the force cant
7414099 i think we need to split up at least that way we can cover more ground and if im caught you wont be implicated
7414100 but i was planning on using you and your ability to look and act the part to get kretz and me to the airlock
7414101 theyve stationed officers at my home and at the airlock he came in theyre expecting him to head there
7414102 there is the forward one you could take us to that
7414103 ive got to find howard first id gladly help you if i could id even gladly go with you but it wouldnt work there are alarms on the airlocks its part of the original system
7414104 of course i didnt think of that dont worry about the alarm i have the system codes but aha we can ask the system if this howard of yours been detected by any of the machines in the system
7414105 its quite possible all i need is an approximate weight you say that hes very large
7414106 do you know how easy that would make police work dr geriant
7414107 call me amber yes thats why i never pointed the idea out to anyone now how much would guess he weighs approximately
7414108 well try that there are a few women in that bracket but it does make the search narrower
7414109 ah two hundred and eighty three pounds moving here at a speed of fifteen miles per hour lets get some more detail good grief there are four of them on a pipe maintenance machine heading inward to the core toward sector zed alpha 32 thats one of the damaged sections
7414110 the other three weigh less than one hundred pounds each males at a guess no i would say that hes with some of the runaways
7414111 to us yes to him no hes quite safe except from being caught by one of the patrols that the force periodically sweep those areas with we arent
7414112 we dont know that hes safe look there are only three i can deal with three easily enough
7414113 and then ill help you get to the airlock and out of here i think we might have to go too
7414114 it doesnt sound too bad back where he came from lets go
7414115 but youre probably all right how did you know about the hidden ways
7414116 the brethren are the people of new eden my habitat
7414117 i am the first man to come from there to here women do not rule there god does
7414118 you i got the impression the original suggestion to include you may have come from thomas theisman but im not sure about that pritchart did assure me however that neither she nor anyone in her administration had anything to do with your attempted assassination and you can believe however much of that you want to
7414119 no she didnt and i thought that was probably significant they know both you and beth have been adopted of course and it was obvious that they have extensive dossiers on both of you im sure theyve been following the articles and other presentations on the cats capabilities since they decided to come out of the closet too
7414120 which means in effect that shes inviting us to bring a pair of furry lie detectors to this summit of hers
7414121 i guess its always possible they havent made that connection after all but i think its unlikely
7414122 the timing on this is interesting weve got several factors working here
7414123 she made very certain i knew about that business in talbott she made the specific point that her offer of a summit is being made at a time when she and her advisers are fully aware of how tightly stretched we are the unstated implication was that instead of an invitation to talk they might have sent a battle fleet
7414124 no and we wont hear anything back from monica for at least another ten or eleven days and thats one reason i said the timing on this was interesting on the chance that the news we get may be good ive been ordered to update our plans for operation sanskrit thats the successor to the cutworm raids with a tentative execution date twelve days from tomorrow well from today actually now
7414125 youre thinking about the way saint just derailed buttercup by suggesting a cease fire to high ridge
7414126 im thinking about the fact that elizabeth is going to remember it unless theyve got a lot more penetration of our security than i believe they do they cant know what our operational schedule is oh theyve probably surmised that eighth fleet was just about ready to resume offensive operations assuming we were going to do that at all when khumalos dispatch arrived and if theyve done the math they probably know were about due to hear back from him but they must have packed you off home almost the same day word of our diversions from home fleet could have reached them to me that sounds like they moved as quickly as possible to take advantage of an opportunity to negotiate seriously im just afraid its going to resonate with buttercup in elizabeths thoughts
7414127 well i hope she doesnt get her dander up this time
7414128 god knows i love her and shes one of the strongest monarchs weve ever had but that temper of hers
7414129 i know everyone thinks shes a warhead with a hairtrigger
7414130 ill even acknowledge that shes one of the best grudge holders i know but she isnt really blind to her responsibilities as a head of state you know
7414131 im just trying to be realistic the fact is that shes got a temper from the dark side of hell when its roused and you know as well as i do how she hates yielding to pressure even from people she knows are giving her their best advice and speaking of pressure pritchart was careful to make sure i knew she knew the goings on in the cluster have given the republic the whip hand diplomatically speaking not only that she told me to inform beth that shes releasing an official statement tomorrow in nouveau paris informing the republic and the galaxy at large that shes issued her invitation
7414132 that was a smart move and youre right elizabeth is going to resent it but shes played the interstellar diplomacy game herself quite well in fact i dont think shell be surprised by it and i doubt very much that any resentment she feels over it would have a decisive impact on her decision
7414133 i hope youre right because hard as i tried to stay cynical i think pritchart really means it she really wants to sit down with beth and negotiate peace
7414134 keep fido quiet or you wont be allowed into bingo
7414135 ill get you my pretty and your little dog too

7414150 we continue to believe apple will need to reposition the ipod touch line in conjunction with its anticipated new product announcement in early to mid september now that the iphone acquisition price is lower
7414151 it could well still be staged in pakistan but the board decided today that if there are doubts four five or six months ahead of the due date of october next year then the board would seek to relocate it
7414152 it was considered but dismissed very rapidly quite simply because there was no longer sufficient lead time to relocate the event in the same time frame
7414153 three countries had indicated to me privately ahead of south africas decision that they would not be able to send a squad for reasons of safety and security
7414154 it is unethical and impermissible to change the rules in the middle of an election to benefit the mayor and the council who are the ones drafting and enacting the legislation to overturn the votes twice of the people
7414155 the biggest thing potentially in new york outside of obama
7414156 i dont want to be insulting to the body im trying to join but it would become a better legislature if you had 12 year terms
7414157 im looking at it from a governance issue an eight year term is just not good
7414158 im not going to get angry at anyone about it at this point but i think it would be wrong not to at least take it to the voters
7414159 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7414160 its kind of a no brainer that thats your ticket

7414163 i did get a little preview of the video they did of her and she was extraordinary
7414164 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country

7414167 i am still tooling around with my speech a little bit
7414168 when their speeches are over there will be no doubt that the clintons are working hard for sen obama
7414169 this will be a unified party this week that is sen clintons intention
7414170 our floor manager will ensure that no protests will break out
7414171 i have done more for sen obama in the last two months than anybody in my position has ever done for a winning nominee and im very proud of that
7414172 theres been some obvious concern that the marriage may not be as solid as folks would like it to be
7414173 if there is any suggestion of otherwise if theres any smell of otherwise it wont be a faint smell it will be raunchy and it wont do her any good
7414174 the voters that the clintons are most likely to attract are the very same voters that barack obama needs
7414175 shes got to talk about barack obama as the solver of the economic issues those target voters confront
7414176 shes going to do what she needs to do to help barack obama
7414177 if there is any kind of soap opera or anything that becomes a distraction its going to be something small and unintentional that gets blown out of proportion
7414178 hes got to talk with more specifics about the economy and connect with average americans who are hurting
7414179 hes got to be tough and hardheaded and honest about what hes going to do
7414180 a government that robs peter to pay paul can always depend on the support of paul
7414181 but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you let him be eternally condemned as we have already said so now i say again if anyone is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted let him be eternally condemned

7414207 kualitas dan jenis dagig sapi di dunia sangat banyak tiap jenis memiliki ciri khas dan grading masing masing misalnya wagyu beef bisa dari level 1 9 karena itu kita harus paham benar soal daging yang akan dipakai untuk steak
7414208 apakah daging sapi yang sudah dilumerkan tidak boleh dibekukan apakah benar daging sapi nggak boleh dicuci
7414209 bagaimana cara mengetahui daging sapi segar dan yang sudah dilayukan
7414210 ini adalah striploin daging sapi yang ada di bagian punggung belakang dekat iga iga juga ada yang short ribs dan ada juga yang back ribs
7414211 yang penting adalah mirepoix ini bumbu kaldu yang terdiri dari potongan wortel daun bawang bawang bombay dan peterseli ini yang akan membuat kaldu enak dan harum
7414212 kalau tidak memakai white wine bisa dipakai white wine vinegar sebagai pengganti dengan tambahan kaldu
7414213 saat dimasak harus dipastikan semua wine sudah menguap dan tumisan bawang agak kering baru ditambahkan cream
7414214 hmm baru sausnya aja sudah enak begini gimana nanti kalau ada daging steaknya ya
7414215 kalau daging sapi sudah berkualitas bagus tidak perlu ditambahkan bumbu berlebihan cukup dengan herb oil saja
7414216 tambahkan garam selalu paling akhir supaya jus daging tidak tertarik keluar dan steak tetap lembut
7414217 walah ini kok empuk enak banget ya wah ini pasti karena herb oil yang wangi

7414246 im so glad that they out of courtesy gave her that opportunity i feel that she deserves it i would have been saddened if she didnt play a big role
7414247 she played a big role because she took in big numbers i think it is important for us the people to hear from a lady who fought and stood up and knows the issues of the world
7414248 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
7414249 on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7414250 emotional stress is highly subjective and is difficult to measure accurately

7414308 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7414309 the handover was marked with a quirky eight minute cameo of the capital that smacked more of the swinging sixties than of the 21st century cosmopolis that will stage the next games
7414310 if this is a statement of intent from the 2012 organisers that they will not try to match beijing in scale or spectacle but will instead rely on flair and wit it is commendable
7414311 as an emerging superpower china felt it had something to prove london should in keeping with our nations character be a little more understated

7414328 its not a new discovery that women are a powerful force
7414329 the news is that everyday women have a powerful economic impact and its time for marketers and advertisers to recognize that and adjust their market ing messages to speak to them
7414330 the gamma woman that meredith is describing is at the center of her friends and wants to be in the know share infor mation and be an educated consumer
7414331 when brands engage these consumers it builds goodwill and helps companies gain tremendous insight
7414332 bloggers are a sought after demo graphic they tend to be 18 to 49 years old more affluent educated and more willing to spread the word about a prod uct than other women online
7414333 the way women share information has changed over the past five years
7414334 in the past two years especially blogs have taken off
7414335 marketers are not as plugged in to the complexities of the target or dont have the time to gather the qualitative data that is the new focus

7414366 i look at these games now that they are over and i wonder what is the next thing for myself for my country for all of us
7414367 we have spent so many years preparing for this event and now it is over i have just played in the most important competition of my career is my life over
7414368 i know thats not true i know that sounds silly but i guess you have to be chinese to understand part of that feeling now and maybe you have to be me to know it all
7414369 did i get everyone in houston worried with the limp
7414370 the bone in the foot is fine i just had some blisters
7414371 this has been a different kind of olympics for me really less of the olympic experience
7414372 i do miss that excitement from the village of sydney and athens you meet athletes that you might never see again the rest of your life
7414373 right now we have to think what can the olympics leave for us not just the village the stadiums the facilities but the things beyond them what can we learn from the olympics
7414374 a lot of people not just athletes every human in the world needs to think about the bigger picture needs to think about what we can do to make this world a better place
7414375 this is the first time that china really has a chance for attention from all over the world
7414376 i know china the last 10 or 20 years has become bigger and more powerful in this world
7414377 but still not many foreign people come to china and the olympics have made china touchable these past weeks not just on tv or in a picture book on in a newspaper there are a lot of people from all over the world here they have come to china to find out for themselves the real china the good things the bad things you know many of the things that are the same in every country to know that weve had a chance to welcome the world and have a chance to let them see us talk to us live with us gives me a good feeling thats a good dream
7414378 after the lithuania game i come back to my room and i feel my energy just go away
7414379 my body is empty i have a couple minutes lying on the bed when i cannot even move not because im tired but because mentally i feel really really sad these games ive prepared for almost my whole life and now theyre over
7414380 we say that every year but still we dont have any excuse let the results say it
7414381 if the pitch before had hit me we would have had the leadoff hitter on in the 10th inning but ill take it the way it ended
7414382 those guys continue to play well every time you call ones name they go up and they do it
7414383 everybody that played contributed reggie abercrombie playing center throws out a runner in the first inning trying to tag up and go i mean every time you put a guy in there they do their job thats what it takes for us to be successful
7414384 its just impossible over the course of 162 games one thing that a long grueling schedule will bring to light is who has the best 25 guys not who has the best seven or eight guys youve got to use everybody and today we did
7414385 go through it in your own mind which of those guys doesnt belong on an nfl roster
7414386 i cant say any of them all of those players are really good football players so when you have that decision to make its very hard but you cant keep everybody whats positive is our organization has given us some good players to make good competition and now its our job to make sure we make the right decision
7414387 i think this is a great position for any of the safeties to be in and for the organization to be in to say you know what we have to make some hard decisions
7414388 every team in the league you want to have that problem because in this league its not how good your starters are its how good your backups are because when the starters go down those are the guys that have to step in
7414389 and thats why teams like green bay and the giants patriots and colts thats why they are always in the playoffs and often advance to the super bowl its not always how well the starters play its the backups
7414390 from where he was to where he is now hes come a long way
7414391 hopefully well see him play on the defensive side of the ball a lot more often against tampa bay
7414392 now that i look back at the 04 experience it was a blessing to myself
7414393 lebron dwyane and also carlos boozer we were at americas lowest point in 04 and now were sitting here because we did a hell of a job putting american basketball back where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7414394 for one moment if we had gone the other way and gotten selfish we wouldnt be sitting with gold medals around our necks
7414395 after 2004 dwyane carmelo and i touched base with each other and said we wanted to make a commitment to be part of usa basketball and try to accomplish something that wed never done before and thats to win a gold medal
7414396 once we came together and said we want to do it we put in our time put in our hearts and we gave up our summers to sacrifice and play the game of basketball which we love to do
7414397 i think they took this tournament very seriously their guys were hungry and wanted to get back to the top thats what theyve done they were able to get back on top and show they should be in first place but they had to work for it
7414398 i meant a six year commitment seriously i felt everything we had done with the infrastructure was great but to really lift the bar and go forward we had to finish and go win
7414399 were going to celebrate now and talk about the future and the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be a part of what we do going forward
7414400 its gonna be tough to put a team like this back together but after the way we told this story how we represented ourselves and our country and enjoyed this experience hopefully everybody will want to do it
7414401 there were young guys in vegas who helped us prepare who have all the talent all they have to do now is grow and most important grow together
7414402 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7414403 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7414404 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7414405 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7414406 thats the plan but i dont think either one of us is aiming for two
7414407 considering the number of kids we lost im a little shocked
7414408 i think thats the reason why were ranked high respect
7414409 respect to the program our tradition and where weve been its not based on what we have coming back
7414410 im a little shocked that we were ranked that high but im not shocked at where katy and carroll are ranked theyre good football teams
7414411 rankings are good for reading and speculation but itll all be decided on the football field
7414412 were a notoriously slow starting team but its not how you start but its how you finish
7414413 i think if cody can get the ball to a j well get the ball in the end zone
7414414 i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7414415 the nigerian government frowns very seriously on these scams and every day tries to track down those who are involved
7414416 it is not in the character of nigerians to be engaged in this kind of scam
7414417 people who send their money are as guilty as those who are asking them to send the money
7414418 the bottom line is anything that sounds too good to be true is too good to be true
7414419 more individual u s athletes will carry home gold medals around their neck than any other nation if you want to count it that way
7414420 whats good for us as a country is overall participation
7414421 were fascinated like any other country by gold medals but what is more important in a way is that our team sports do very well
7414422 thats what gets the kids out of the chairs and away from the computers and the obesity problems in our country and other countries so they can play everybody can play on a team
7414423 in athens in 2004 our team sports took a hit
7414424 we knew it would be difficult here but we continued to invest we will not abandon these sports in an effort to earn medals in individual sports that sometimes might be less expensive
7414425 the citizens of the united states of america and even the rest of the world can be proud of the participation of the united states and our team here
7414426 people stepped up and did better than they had tracked but we always said that china would be strong and you always get a medals bump as the host country when things shook out it really did track with what we saw coming in
7414427 we have to go back now and see if there is a way to bring these finishes up and turn them into gold medals
7414428 that will keep me in a job for the next four years
7414429 were gong to have to redouble our effort in future games
7414430 team sports will continue to be an important part of our culture even though its far cheaper to train one athlete for an individual sport than 18 to 30 for a team sport
7414431 the key for us is to find a way to stay competitive in multi medal sports without destroying the integrity of our team sports
7414432 learned to fly at pensacola though his performance was below par at best good enough to get by he liked flying but didnt love it
7414433 mccain was practicing landings his engine quit and he plunged into corpus christi bay knocked unconscious by the impact he came to as the plane settled to the bottom
7414434 the engine was removed from the aircraft that afternoon mounted on a test stand and a new propeller installed it was flushed with fresh water and started it ran just fine so the theory of engine failure was proven false
7414435 positively one of the weakest students to pass our way and received consistently poor marks and a number of dangerous down grades assigned by more than one instructor he had no real ability and was clearly out of his element in an airplane and way over his head even as a junior naval officer
7414436 he took out some power lines reminiscent of the 1998 incident in which a marine corps jet sliced through the cables of a gondola at an italian ski resort killing 20 which led to a spate of newspaper stories in which he was predictably identified as the son of an admiral
7414437 that equals out to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down
7414438 was the kind of guy you wanted to room with not fly with he was reckless and thats critical when you start thinking about whos going to be the president
7414439 but the navy accident rate was cut in half the day john mccain was shot down
7414440 after every such incident an inquiry is conducted to conclude the cause of the crash if it were anyone other than the admirals son his wings would have been pulled but thats where that kind of father comes in handy
7414441 or the government would be buying a hell of a lot more planes
7414442 you for example are highly critical of israel without demonstrating even the slightest inclination toward anti jewish sentiment
7414443 ron paul he cant win why throw away your vote
7414444 mmmm este a tip a sabe m s que yo es superior
7414445 que es lo que tengo que hacer para convertirme en gotico
7414446 im feeling all right knock on wood i dont have any problems any injuries im trying to get back in shape so im trying to train very hard and doing my best to get as fit as possible for the tournament
7414447 finally i dont have my physical problem anymore its finished its now a matter of getting all these leg muscles back and feeling like i used to feel before when i was fit and ready to play
7414448 im still working very hard and some of the things dont happen overnight i need time to train you cannot get your endurance and your strength back in a few days
7414449 so i will try to keep working hard and we will see how everything goes
7414450 ive had a tough year with injuries so many injuries and i was also sick in the middle of the year ive been struggling because when you have these kinds of problems its tough to train 100 per cent i finally decide to train and i have some other problem where i have to rest one week or two weeks so i lose matches
7414451 tennis nowadays believe it or not is the most popular sport in serbia that has never been the case we didnt have any players and we didnt have a tradition in tennis now that we have three top three in the world ivanovic herself and mens number three novak djokovic its really amazing its a great thing for our country
7414452 weve learned from research that there is a fundamental lack of awareness about the mobile web and most people dont know that they can get the weather on their phones
7414453 we had to do some mar keting that was a little bit old school
7414454 you cant rely on promoting mobile through mobile so few people are deeply engaged in the mobile channel that you need to promote broadly
7414455 it helps to promote a new product through a number of different channels because different people respond in different ways
7414456 just because youre an early adopter that doesnt mean you should be punished
7414457 to give you a sense of what that kind of lobbying gets you
7414458 ceo of the largest sub prime lender was promised a 100 million severance package at a time when more than two million americans were facing foreclosure including nearly 14 000 right here in san antonio
7414459 the sub prime financial engineering that created the wall street meltdown was developed by the pritzkers and ernst and young working with merrill lynch to sell bonds securitized by sub prime mortgages
7414460 were provided to merrill lynch by a nation wide pritzker origination system using superior as the cash cow with many millions in fdic insured deposits superiors owners were to sub prime lending what michael milken was to junk bonds
7414461 started life with enormous tax benefits and a substantial amount of fslic guaranteed assets under a fslic assistance agreement
7414462 to concentrate on sub prime lending principally on home mortgages but for a while in sub prime auto lending too
7414463 tainted with the hallmarks of a mini enron scandal and yet the banks owners members of one of americas wealthiest families ultimately could end up profiting from the banks collapse while many of superiors borrowers and depositors suffer financial losses
7414464 superiors outside auditor which doubled as a financial consultant engaged in dubious accounting practices that kept feckless regulators at bay many individuals disproportionately low income and minority borrowers with spotty credit records had apparently been exploited through predatory lending techniques including exorbitant fees inadequate disclosure and high interest rates
7414465 the failure of superior bank was directly attributable to the banks board of directors and executives ignoring sound risk management principles
7414466 superior failed at a time of historically low interest rates high employment a strong economy and a growing housing market there was no reason for it to fail unless you consider gross negligence a flawed business plan and a conspiracy to deceive the regulators who were clearly asleep and were negligent themselves in their duties of protecting the class of underinsured depositors
7414467 the pritzkers like to say they did sub prime lending to help the disadvantaged get into the home equity business but it would be more accurate to state they ran a very large nation wide predatory lending operation
7414468 this is a story of two americas with two sets of laws one for the rich and powerful and another for the rest of us
7414469 my clients will all be dead before they get back their money given the supreme courts recent decision to uphold the lower court which put the predatory owners on the front of the line if any money is recovered
7414470 barack obama has already made it very clear that hes going to crack down on fraudulent brokers and lenders
7414471 one of the most fearful things about sin is its power to harden the one who practices it the deeper a man goes in sin the less sin bothers him every sinner finds himself now committing sins that he once despised and the sins that he now despises he will someday find himself committing it should shock us to remember that adolph hitler was once a little boy playing with toys just like other little boys man knows the beginning of sin but no man has ever known the end of sin

7414489 you made an unlawful u turn in a residential district
7414490 all i wanted was to give the guy a verbal warning so i could document in my log that i was out here doing what i was supposed to be doing
7414491 how can i refuse with you standing there with your hand on your gun
7414492 im sorry sir but you were the eighth car and since i dont have discretion in this matter i have to give you this infraction if youre facing your second infraction in three to five years its more likely because you speed too much and dont follow traffic laws
7414493 in 1969 my husband jimmy george and i relocated to lafayette la
7414494 i was one of five white teachers in a totally black school and part of the reason we were there was to help the students get used to white teachers the following year all of the students were going to be bused to other schools in lafayette and paul breaux was to be closed
7414495 these people were actually losing the heart of their community i learned about the families their hopes and their dreams their fears
7414496 it was a very emotional time for the students it opened my eyes to so many things the civil rights movement empathy with the families and the fact that i was in the minority for the first time in my life i was out of my comfort zone trying to understand another culture
7414497 that was the year that made me the person and the educator that i am today when i meet with students now im truly able to relate with a lot of diverse people and understand their points of view because of that year
7414498 my most memorable year would be my very first year but not for the traditional reasons most people tell about the long hours and chaos my experience was a lot more positive than that it was in the state of north carolina the school district in jacksonville and about 10 miles out was the tight knit community of richland n c the students all walked to school there and it was quite different from an inner city district ten or 15 years separated me from the other teachers there and they nurtured me i just bonded with those kids i even went back to north carolina for their graduation the next most memorable year was when i started teaching in august of 2001 at meacham middle school here in fort worth on the north side and i taught there until 2007 in my experience there were some years more difficult than others there but i jell really well with that age group and because of that first year in north carolina and the nurturing of the teachers i knew how to build a respectful relationship and a good rapport with them thats all ive ever taught or wanted to teach middle school and math there are many strengths that middle school students come with and some deficiencies as with all students its ok if they like you but not if you let them get away with anything ive been in administration for a year as a middle school math specialist and a teacher on assignment its a philosophical change but all kids can learn and its still my job to figure out how one thing ive observed in the fort worth isd is were improving teaching techniques the way i was nurtured and holding students to high standards we want to better prepare students as thinkers and prepare them for high school
7414499 its snippets of every year that mean the most to me so my most memorable year would be this past year its those teachable moments that make it worthwhile and there were quite a few
7414500 there are still lots of doubts about obama we just dont know him
7414501 we need to see something from obama we want to leave unified
7414502 john mccain says we might stay in iraq for 100 years many latinos are being injured and killed in iraq latino senior citizens and latino veterans will see that they are better off with obama he will win the latino vote decisively
7414503 as much as id like to believe what pena says its just not true
7414504 there is a severe split in the party the obama people are just not doing enough
7414505 would be a lot of drunk really angry delegates giving them an earful and still not supporting obama
7414506 that meant students would end up being active for just one semester
7414507 this way they are active the whole year the intent of the legislation was to put physical education requirements back into middle schools and thats good
7414508 this will help prepare our future parents so they will know how to help each other and raise a child together even if a relationship doesnt work out
7414509 this is our best chance at winning the white house in a long time
7414510 i am so fired up and so are all the delegates ive talked to
7414511 maybe then ill hear what it is that moves all these obama people
7414512 the democratic party is about as united as ive ever seen it
7414513 maybe theres some clinton supporters out there who havent seen the light yet but they need to get over it
7414514 the view that john mccain is this cuddly old grandpa is just a bunch of you know what hes anti choice anti healthcare and more pro iraq war than george bush and dick cheney
7414515 i cannot put into words what it feels like knowing that ill be witnessing something this historic
7414516 when youre a kid in school you learn about martin luther king and the i have a dream speech
7414517 and now 45 years to the day of that speech well be seeing an african american accepting the democratic nomination for president
7414518 im not a conspiracy theorist obamas going to win the nomination
7414519 even though id still like hillary to be the nominee and get elected president im excited about the democrats chances this year i think were going to win
7414520 the iraq war weighed heavily with me and he was against it from the start plus i like what hes saying about the economy and the environment
7414521 ive taken him with me to so many meetings and rallies this past year that he must think that mommy just has a ton of friends
7414522 aid to georgia and the future of its relations with russia
7414523 russia has not yet fulfilled its commitment to the six point peace plan on withdrawal to pre conflict positions
7414524 we need to see a clear and tangible outcome of the fight against fraud
7414525 make european populations doubt the reasons for the international engagement in afghanistan
7414526 could lay foundations for the revision of the eus policy
7414527 i still think macs are the best information appliance on the market but until they are as reliable and easy to use as my toaster or refrigerator theres room for improvement
7414528 if you were happy all the time you wouldnt be human youd be a game show host
7414529 no les va a gustar que lo diga pero su estilo de vida a diferencia de la escena punk es una subcultura de clase media
7414530 son por lo general j venes inteligentes que han rechazado la idea de que los adolescentes deben cumplir con ciertos requerimientos
7414531 donde yo vivo son generalmente los pandilleros quienes comienzan con la violencia y no los g ticos entonces creo que somos un grupo bastante pac fico
7414532 nos dedicamos a nuestras propias cosas y hacemos lo que nos gusta hacer pero los g ticos son como cualquier otro grupo y gran parte depende del individuo
7414533 en general somos bastante sensibles pero tambi n hay algunos que no lo son que est n en una pose algunos terminar n siendo m dicos y otros estar n desocupados los g ticos son una mezcla de personalidades como todo el mundo
7414534 no se trata de ajustarse a una subcultura particular esto se trata de mi vida estoy m s all de pensarme como g tica soy s lo yo
7414535 hay abuelas que vienen y me dicen que les hubiese gustado poder vestirse como yo cuando eran j venes
7414536 no tiene ni comparaci n con lo que sucede en alemania all son miles ac como mucho seremos 500 hoy alemania es la catedral g tica de los 90 las bandas g ticas se basan mucho en mitolog as y religiones paganas es un elemento fuerte a la hora de hacer m sica porque es un elemento seductor claro que dentro de los elementos tambi n est el sexo hay una cultura sexual est el fetichismo lo sadomasoquista que no est n implicados en lo g tico son elementos que conviven con lo g tico pero tambi n fuera de l me gustar a que el movimiento g tico argentino crezca que no se pierdan los valores ni todo ese gusto under que yo siempre defend por eso no me interesan las comunidades latinas son truchas y aunque en m xico hay una movida grande hay que hacer la nuestra y no mirar al resto
7414537 en el g tico empec hace 3 a os cuando escuch por primera vez a lacrimosa esto tuvo un fuerte impacto en mi persona la forma de tocar y su personalidad me transmiti algo distinto a todo lo que se escuchaba por ah dentro del g tico vi que hay mucho sentimiento cosa que no pasa con el resto de los otros g neros musicales a esto hay que agregarle que posee una cultura propia que no todos la tienen igualmente no soy de esos que se visten siempre de negro
7414538 mi mam dice que estoy loca y quiz s pero ha sido en este universo g tico en el que yo empec a encontrar desde los 15 a os respuesta a m ltiples preguntas personales

7414541 while barack obama campaigns on expanding health care his chief strategist uses political tactics to push poor people away from care at the university of chicago medical center this is yet another example of obamas rhetoric not matching his record and raises serious questions about whether americans can trust him on this important issue
7414542 a few years ago executives at the prestigious university of chicago medical center were concerned that an increasing number of patients were arriving at their emergency room with what the executives considered to be non urgent complaints the visits were costly to the hospital and many of the patients coming from the surrounding south side neighborhood were poor and uninsured the hospital launched an innovative program to steer the patients to existing neighborhood clinics to deal with their health needs
7414543 in december 2006 the medical center hired a public relations firm ask public strategies to help sell the urban health initiative
7414544 ask started work in january 2007 the next month barack obama launched his campaign
7414545 im here to talk to georgian leaders and our u s assessment team to hear what they need
7414546 we have to get it right so we can help people quickly we want to optimize the humanitarian aid effort and bring in the right stuff to the right place at the right time
7414547 we express our gratitude for your help and will never forget what you have done to help us in our time of need
7414548 there is an agreement between two heads of state and there has to be compliance
7414549 my assessment is that the russian withdrawal is now slower than it ought to be the russians need to do what they said they were going to do almost a week ago and withdraw

7414551 further strengthens the engines pulling power at middle rpm levels
7414552 its absolutely surreal i never thought that this would be possible
7414553 i wasnt even sure of my medal chances at all
7414554 thats it its a silver medal i am so happy with this and then i won i cant believe it im so happy
7414555 i had some very wise words and some very good advice before coming into the 10m competition to just enjoy it have fun and thats what i thought right from the very first dive in the prelims to the very last dive in the final
7414556 i was definitely stressing it to myself just enjoy the moment there is nothing you can do to change whats about to happen so just enjoy it and it worked
7414557 we cant afford for lachlan to go at the moment
7414558 we cannot subject our members to the laws of the government
7414559 the inaction of the milf leadership will be construed as its tacit approval of the criminal acts of its commanders and will be a clear proof of the milf leaderships insincerity to pursue the conclusion of the peace talks
7414560 we want to continue peace negotiations but not at the expense of our laws there is no all out war in mindanao this is waging all out peace in mindanao we have gone a long way for peace but not at the expense of our innocent civilians who seek vindication for the violence inflicted on them by those lawless milf groups our peace loving citizens expect no less
7414561 we want to reach an agreement that at the end we can find the words end of conflict
7414562 how can i make an extra 3 to 5k a month
7414563 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7414564 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7414565 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7414566 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7414567 i have no problem with his performance but we need some production and pressure from other people
7414568 up front we have to put more pressure on the quarterback
7414569 in return if we bring a linebacker we have to be able to slip a block and make a play on the quarterback
7414570 how many sacks did dallas get zero but they made matt schaub throw off rhythm and thats what we need to generate and along with that on the back end weve got to play some tighter coverage and make that quarterback have to hold that ball
7414571 guys get hurt and theres nothing you can do about it the key is that you expect them back and i would say right now theres no doubt we expect ahman back pretty quick
7414572 im trying to get better and not fumble so im going to walk around with this all day
7414573 if youve ever seen the movie the program i have to keep these guys from touching my friend ball right here
7414574 ive been walking around with it tucked all day running with it conditioning itll help me
7414575 i think joe kind of put a bug in their ear
7414576 he probably has a treat for them if they get it from me i dont want them to get that treat

7414588 during these olympics though i have found myself watching the usa womans softball team beating up on their competition like they were impersonating the usa mens basketball team i enjoy the pace of the womens game the women arent spitting every other second or playing with themselves on every swing
7414589 even though if jennie finch wants to play with herself
7414590 i hope theyre opportunities for women to play sports professionally in america and make a ton of money doing it until the end of time saying all that you still couldnt get me to watch a womans fill in the sport here if they were playing naked in my backyard for the most part

7414595 in all topics mr obama displays a similar worried serious looking facial pattern even when talking about more positive subjects his facial expressions do not signal positive affective states
7414596 there is an element of the fact that he is on the edges of his comfort zone here
7414597 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face
7414598 the dominating attitude as transmitted by his vocal style is that of concern and sincere involvement
7414599 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine
7414600 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7414601 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7414602 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7414603 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7414604 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7414605 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7414606 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7414607 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7414611 going into a presidential campaign is not something he has done before and you could say it is written all over his face

7414613 his smile is often not fully developed ie his cheek raising muscles do not participate enough in the expression of positive affect to be perceived as genuine
7414614 i couldnt help but wonder if the on screen chemistry is for real i mean they came back from greece where the movie was filmed like lovers love rubbed off on them
7414615 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
7414616 this decision is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
7414617 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the us forces
7414618 really we are very very close to closing this agreement and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
7414619 he about broke my hand with that ball he hit right at me
7414620 when youre hot i could have probably in this series thrown my bat like yadi molina did a couple times and probably got a couple base hits thats the way it is you got to take it when it comes because thats kind of making up for the past series that you had
7414621 we tried to throw him quality strikes he can hit quality strikes thats the problem at some point you have to throw to him
7414622 that isnt going to turn my switch on to try and play the game hard
7414623 i play the game hard no matter what no matter who is in town
7414624 he didnt get to 350 and 80 rbis in two series
7414625 the difference in both of those series is that pitching staffs competed against him they gave him pitches to hit some of it is their attitude some of it is weve got production behind him
7414626 it was a tough year for us because we didnt have the playoffs that year
7414627 if i do have a chance to lets say win the batting title and my team doesnt get to the playoffs i didnt do my job so thats what i play for
7414628 but he eats up those blockers so that the linebackers can run sideline to sideline
7414629 hes playing very hard hes not going to allow himself to fail
7414630 what youre seeing is a guy thats getting comfortable in a system and knowing that once he does hes just going to make great strides
7414631 we certainly have a lot of expectations for him but were also patient knowing a lot of its baby steps right now
7414632 not as bad as the one he had last year
7414633 has put himself in a pretty good position for that
7414634 the tough part is weve got a limited week were not going to be able to go out there in full pads for a whole week of practice to get him as ready as wed like for
7414635 but in practice hell take snaps with not only the first unit but the second unit and the third unit just to catch up on plays weve got to keep accelerating him
7414636 i think the offensive line has really really performed well all preseason
7414637 but it wasnt me he wasnt ready he was getting his voice
7414638 i told him when i said hello to him im counting on you to improve my mood
7414639 ive thrown twice in the last nine days so im definitely fresh
7414640 it went through my mind that if a guy got on base in the eighth atlanta had one hit in the inning i could be in there and then they called down and told me to get ready
7414641 he and kyle mcclellan both want to talk pitching and they want to learn
7414642 if they didnt come to me and want to learn im not going to go push it on them
7414643 they know theres a difference between pitching here and in the minor leagues and they want to learn ive been on teams where young guys come up and think theyre going to come in and dominate and not have to do anything different it usually takes them a couple of trips to the minor leagues before they figure out they need to come up and learn something
7414644 the first thing i would do is give atlanta infielder martin prado credit for hustling most guys when that ball goes in the second basemans glove would back off a little he deserves the most credit
7414645 we want to make sure its right before i do anything else
7414646 run hit throw catch and he runs hard so im definitely concerned about it
7414647 he came to spring training as a rule 5 draft guy
7414648 so hes getting some close scrutiny every time hes doing anything coaches are watching him hes one of those guys you focus on you dont have to go watch albert swing
7414649 thats how its supposed to work you get fresh blood in there on sunday afternoon what both brian and joe did some of it is talent but a lot is attitude not giving in to lack of playing time and just competing
7414650 youve got guys who are specialized in the bullpen but the goal is to pitch as deep as possible i go out there every time hoping to go nine
7414651 and i feel i can help any team if given an opportunity i was watching the olympics and they were interviewing michael phelps i guess im paraphrasing but he said something like a great player is determined by how he does when the odds are against him
7414652 if i want to be that great player and the odds are stacked against me because im not playing a lot ive got to shine
7414653 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7414654 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7414655 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7414656 westchester was a good golf course this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course
7414657 i was surprised to see it go in and he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7414658 its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7414659 i was a good round and it gives me some momentum to carry over
7414660 goddamn motherfuckers marylou theyre pissing on my tent oh lord some bastard is pissing on my tent get me the bat
7414661 when you take time away from each other it gives you both the opportunity to collect new thoughts new stories and
7414662 you havent called me and im thinking that means youre having second thoughts about us
7414663 gotten up the guts to actually cross the threshold and tell you that hes not ready for a relationship he means business
7414664 once a guy decides how he sees a girl in his life its hard to break out of that thinking
7414665 well if you like the way she looks then why are you with me im the total opposite
7414666 if a guy uses that he loves you or likes you a whole heck of a lot
7414667 the match the american duos 67th straight international victory served to underscore may treanor and walshs rare longevity as this
7414668 the match the american duos 67th straight international victory served to underscore may treanor and walshs rare longevity as this sports most successful partnership
7414669 we want to dominate we dont want to let our opponents come up for air ever
7414670 the match the american duos 67th straight international victory served to underscore may treanor and walshs rare longevity as this
7414671 the us has a chance to win their third gold medal ever in womens soccer theyve had much success here in the olympics only losing one gold medal final the us has a chance to show their soccer dominance to the rest of the world once again
7414672 the match the american duos 67th straight international victory served to underscore may treanor and walshs rare longevity as this
7414673 when i grow up i wanna be just like you
7414674 i know he was kidding but man he pushes my buttons and he knows that he does and i just wish hed stop
7414675 but i also know that until i stop reacting hell keep doing it
7414676 you know youre pushing my buttons and i know youre doing it on purpose why do you always do this and would you please just stop
7414677 ugh that is exactly what i just told s on our last break
7414678 were aware of the issue and were working hard to fix it
7414679 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
7414680 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
7414681 if half the lawyers would become plumbers two of mans biggest problems would be solved
7414682 syndicalism is more than just a style of unionism it is a theory of how to create a true democracy without authority
7414683 let every person put forth their best bet for the best candidate and we will let the nominee with the most votes govern all
7414684 the labouring classes of society as the foundation on which the whole fabric rests
7414685 the cultivator and the manufacturer are the primary means of all the wealth that exists in the world
7414686 only in the realm of economy are the workers able to display their full strength for it is their activity as producers which holds together the whole social structure and guarantees the existence of society only as a producer and creator of social wealth does the worker become aware of his strength
7414687 the grounds of an opinion on the policy of restricting the importation of foreign corn
7414688 i began to live a duel life by day i investigated the local dioceses dug up documents in courthouses talked with a seemingly endless string of victims and interviewed bishops their aides attorneys and priests in my off hours i put in my final months of training to become a catholic
7414689 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7414690 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7414691 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence
7414692 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7414693 there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7414694 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7414695 some of the changes in china are obvious today others will become apparent with time
7414696 the legacy of these games is ultimately up to the chinese people
7414697 the olympic games staged in china provides a good window and a good showcasing for the real china
7414698 history will show what china is really like and how china is on the right path and history will show how correct the decision the ioc took in 2001 was to award the games to china
7414699 it puts things in perspective youve got to fight for every inch so i think thats exactly what were doing
7414700 were both going to work hard and were going to keep pushing each other and i think well build a great relationship along the way
7414701 theyre still making some mistakes their eyes are still a little bit wide out there but the good thing about them is if they make a mistake they come right back and try to make a play and they want to learn
7414702 its not something where they get discouraged so theyre good kids first and they have a heck of a lot of talent i think you saw what both of them can do in different situations
7414703 i had to calm myself down and just tell myself just go have fun this is just another practice
7414704 i saw some flashes of really good football and i saw some flashes of rookie mistakes
7414705 but what i was the most pleased with was the speed they played at they played fast they kind of changed the game in a lot of ways when they started to make plays and they were on the field together
7414706 i think the skys the limit for those young guys
7414707 as long as they improve and work hard theyve got the ability to get more and more playing time
7414708 right now were just pleased that they had a good outing
7414709 now theyve got to show that they can back it up with another one and another one
7414710 its not a series thats gone on 35 or 40 years but the rivalry developed off the basketball situation
7414711 there was a lot of pride off that basketball game having missouri and illinois in the same place our football guys follow those basketball guys intensely and that game is about as big as you find in college basketball now its carrying over to the football game
7414712 we have our kansas game which is our rivalry that we have in our league and it is what it is
7414713 but theres no question about it this game is huge
7414714 i dont know what the market is for the college basketball games but i think 66 000 would be pretty good for basketball
7414715 even when both teams were not very good a few years ago when we were playing them it was still a bowl game atmosphere
7414716 thats just the passion that illinois fans have and missouri fans have
7414717 to me you kind of like compare it to the michigan notre dame game
7414718 they have this great great rivalry they play a lot but they dont play the game every year forever they might play it for four years take a few years off etc
7414719 so theres going to be some discussion down the road on that ill certainly have input with mu athletics director mike alden on it everybody has to look at their schedule the same way if you can get it where youre playing at least four years out of a decade thats something wed have to look at
7414720 i think well actually start talking about extending the series this year when were down in st louis
7414721 i have calls into mike now we started last summer but just didnt get the chance
7414722 to be fair we wanted to see what this years game would look like and it looks like its going to be a pretty good game he and i both like the game whether we play in st louis or go back to home and away
7414723 we like the presence of it its very good financially for us
7414724 its a great environment i know its great financially for the city and this year its going to be on espn so all eyes are going to be on st louis mo which obviously is a hotbed of recruiting for us these games are a lot of fun to coach in
7414725 all of our top kids in the state will be there in particular the st louis area and thats always great
7414726 and obviously the team that wins that game has a little bit of bragging rights for a little bit so thats important
7414727 it just provides that extra excitement to be able to play in front of my hometown the first game of the season
7414728 every game is a big game to me and this organization so it doesnt matter if we play illinois first game or if were playing ohio state or if were playing semo first game
7414729 even around campus people are starting to talk about the missouri game now
7414730 everyone is excited and that cant do anything but get you pumped for the game its set up perfect its going to be a big time game theres a lot of hype going into this game
7414731 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
7414732 we would be expecting for at least the industry trend
7414733 if he mugabe goes further and appoints a cabinet it will be against the letter and spirit of the mou
7414734 do they say in that figure that we can no longer afford bus fares rent hospital fees and that we cant buy groceries if the numbers dont say that then it is meaningless
7414735 when youre going into a hyper inflation cycle until such a time as the authorities take appropriate steps to counter it it seems to continue to spiral out of control
7414736 i wasnt perfect last season i think i can be a lot better than i was im not going to lie last year was shocking to me
7414737 i think maurice is going to be a better player this season than he was last year even if his numbers arent
7414738 maurice has got to just get a little more fire in his tummy consistently but hes got a lot of ability
7414739 i needle him all the time about yeah every once in a while you need a kick in the rear end and we go from there but i like him hes a good football player
7414740 one thing about mo is that he likes to play football
7414741 after a while the double teams get annoying and you feel like youre not being productive
7414742 you just have to overcome that and play hard every snap
7414743 i dont even think they acknowledge football there unless youre the no 1 team or player in the nation
7414744 i guess i just lucked out actually i am surprised that penn state recruited me i was supposed to be a basketball player
7414745 hes going out there looking lackluster and still ripping people apart
7414746 when he comes to bat in with runners in scoring position this is what he gets pitches off the plate
7414747 we just dont protect him enough what if he was protected to where you couldnt pitch around him this guy doesnt miss a pitch in the middle of the plate very often
7414748 theres nobody in baseball thats better than the guy who plays first base for us
7414749 and i mean nobody and the great majority of the people in uniform in this game and the scouts agree with that

7414763 growth industry but the agency has likewise increased its efforts to crack down on those who prey on children
7414764 in just the past decade we have moved from lone predators with limited reach to global communities of pedophiles on the internet
7414765 we have moved from back alley bookstores to criminal enterprises that treat children as merely another commodity for sale in the global marketplace we have moved from videos in plain brown packages to encrypted websites flash drives and cell phones capable of storing thousands of images
7414766 these teams have been deployed 33 times to assist state and local law enforcement with 15 children safely recovered

7414779 joe biden et moi sommes amis depuis beaucoup beaucoup dann es et nous nous connaissons tr s bien tous les deux et je pense quobama a effectu un choix tr s avis

7414781 have you ever been running late to work only to notice some bodily fluid on you
7414782 so i bet you dont have a diaper bag that can carry a laptop
7414783 oh h t as your toddler picks up your 5k camera body with an 1800 lens attached to it
7414784 guess i will have to rearrange my plans next week as now the nanny caught the stomach bug that went around the house last week
7414785 i think its exceedingly important that we dont look at the success here as a moment in time
7414786 because if we dont carry on from what we accomplished here and build we will have done a disservice to olympians in the future
7414787 we are playing with the big boys when we come to the olympics especially the summer olympics and the 205 countries that are here
7414788 weve gotten a little better but were going to need more money if we are going to make that climb
7414789 i go through these emotionally i am a canadian too
7414790 my heart broke for marie helene premont who didnt finish at the bike and you cant imagine what we felt for adam in his first race knowing the intensity he brings to what he does
7414791 there were many of those moments but there were many of the eric lamaze gold and silver in equestrian moments and alex despatie who won silver
7414792 im no longer saying fourth we almost had a medal
7414793 im saying silver what could we have done to have the gold if you start thinking that way it pulls the system up
7414794 five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered except maybe towards the end a little bit on the clay so maybe now it changes a little bit because obviously theres a shift in the rankings rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7414795 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7414796 i went to watch the musical phantom of the opera one night i have some touristic a little bit through central park and later just playing a little bit
7414797 i went from cincinnati i went back home to belgrade and then went to beijing and then came here everything in ten days you can imagine how i feel
7414798 no plans if it comes it comes spontaneous well see
7414799 i think it was berlin in may i dont know i just went there and i said i just want to go out there and play my game i said i dont care if i win the match or lose but ill just do what my coach tells me and just go for the shots certainly it worked out and why i was not doing this before
7414800 you really want to know what the personalities are like
7414801 the more outside the box the environment the more the individual shows his true self
7414802 theres certainly a place for absolutely brilliant people but if the firm is structured where every single lawyer needs to multitask that firm will be looking more at social skills
7414803 we consider the summer program an 11 week to 12 week interview
7414804 one of the important parts of the summer program is determining whether we can place a summer in front of a client in a social or business context
7414805 you knew that it wasnt fully intended for you to just enjoy yourself but for the firm to get to know you are you a nice person fun interesting
7414806 every year there is a story or two of a summer who behaves really badly
7414807 once there summer associates associates and partners put their fear of heights to the test and enjoy an exciting day of climbing
7414808 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7414809 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7414810 chinese authorities informed us last night that the eight individuals detained august 20 and 21 respectively were deported by chinese authorities
7414811 we urge china to take positive steps to address international and domestic concerns about its record on human rights and religious freedoms
7414812 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of ten tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games
7414813 i hope the same mask that protected me in beijing will help him protect his people
7414814 some italian athletes autonomously and without renouncing their commitment to sports made a symbolic gesture in favor of tibet and the dalai lama
7414815 in the field of great conquests for civil rights public opinion makes the difference and to move public opinion the gesture of an athlete is more important than the gesture
7414816 abuses not only increased but china has also exported abuses by supporting authoritarian regimes in myanmar sudan and zimbabwe
7414817 before the games china talked about improving human rights but they have killed many dissidents in china and tibet and tried to cover things up by curbing press freedoms
7414818 tens of thousands of people in myanmar were slaughtered by the military junta and myanmars democracy movement leader aung san su kyi has been under house arrest for 12 years
7414819 the military junta doesnt care about international pressure because china has their back
7414820 its true that mcdonalds has long been an olympic partner but theyre spending more money than ever in beijing because they only see a market of 1 billion potential customers but not people being killed
7414821 mcdonalds does not see the 200 000 people who have died in ethnic cleansing in darfur china supported the sudanese government and provided them with weapons in exchange for oil
7414822 ma told us that he would consider boycotting the games if repression in tibet didnt stop before the olympics but now we know who he really is
7414823 there are five subjects pushing a grocery cart and they have a blanket covering whatever is in there
7414824 but i might have to stay up late and have a cigar
7414825 i cant be out of the district for that long
7414826 if our parents could stand up to biting dogs in alabama we can stand up to special interests in americas cities
7414827 which i dont think does anything for the district of columbia
7414828 the only thing i can figure out is the people who are elected as union officials want to keep their jobs
7414829 disrespectful to teachers and naive youre not going to change the current system until you bring in teachers and their collective voice
7414830 you know youve got two kinds of clinton people youve got the professionals like me and were here
7414831 i think joe biden is a great pick for obama
7414832 if somebody told me a few short years ago that this would be happening i would have said you are crazy
7414833 acknowledges responsibility for most of the mistakes and misjudgments that led to his early departure from the race saying he was cocky immature and naive about the demands of a presidential campaign
7414834 to demonstrate the staying power and the seriousness a lot of you reporters doubted that i have
7414835 discontent over the failure of our political system is rampant throughout our citizenry
7414836 it is in this gathering of discontent that my candidacy intends to find its voice
7414837 we wonder why it is that blue collar workers who come from a heritage that is the democratic party began to leave it its because we really dont respect them
7414838 hes a happy warrior he loves the whole thing but hell punch you out
7414839 nobody has as many ties in the foreign policy establishment as joe does
7414840 become a great pantomime where the standard of judgment is no longer real results but the flickering image of seriousness skillfully crafted to squeeze into a 30 second spot have a problem we have an answer but rarely a solution
7414841 handset manufacturers are under pressure to deal with electronic waste issues and show they are looking for more sustainable practices
7414842 weve seen a lot of interest in this as the wave of the future
7414843 someone with an old pick up truck with no shocks will have a glorious time with m2e technology but someone with a mercedes will have to spend more time

7414845 oh my god you have to read this its the best book ever
7414846 man weve known bobby kid rocks name is robert ritchie for a long time
7414847 actually he was the one who helped lynyrd skynyrd get inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame we had done shows with him where we did two nights in detroit with him years ago which was great
7414848 well we have a lot of little kids at our shows anyway but i can guarantee you this he opens us up to a lot of girls
7414849 last night i was getting an eyeful i was like wow no complaints there he definitely attracts the women
7414850 we dont change anything theyre great songs so were looking forward to letting the fans be the judge of that
7414851 were looking at that it was kind of a cool thing
7414852 ronnie and the band were cutting street survivors and it was the second or third verse and he stopped it and that was it so it was kind of cool to find that one
7414853 you know people always go so you guys have been back together but the music has never left
7414854 even that 10 year hiatus that the band had after the plane crash the music was still around its like anything else jim croce jimi hendrix ricky nelson when something happens and its bad it seems that the music becomes more valuable
7414855 ill have on my damn blue jeans some good old skechers and a t shirt
7414856 i would hope that he would think it was pretty damn good otherwise i would get a good ass kicking
7414857 do not rejoice in his defeat you men for though the world has stood up and stopped the bastard the bitch that bore him is in heat again
7414858 after he married terrahsa didnt john kerry begin practicing judaism he also has paternal gradparents that were jewish what religion is john kerry
7414859 ragheads are boy bumpers as clearly as they are women haters it all goes together
7414860 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man

7414884 nuestra actividad indica alejandro g mez es promover el baile tradicional y aprender de nuestros mayores
7414885 aprovechando que estamos pr cticamente en el barrio se ala el secretario de la entidad alejandro g mez pretendemos demostrar lo que estamos haciendo en estos momentos en la asociaci n antes de tomarnos un descanso hasta octubre
7414886 requiere una notable especializaci n en las tareas de mantenimiento y conservaci n incluyendo adem s las tareas de suministro el ctrico
7414887 m s que un repunte de las solicitudes en galicia lo m s relevante es el incremento del inter s y la petici n de informaci n sobre el programa
7414888 y las cuatro primeras solicitudes de retorno desde que empez el a o
7414889 los sectores m s afectados como la construcci n aqu no tienen tanto peso eso hace que los inmigrantes que viven en galicia no vean la situaci n tan grave desempleo y retorno van unidos
7414890 tengo que reconocer que los fuegos de la batalla fueron incre bles
7414891 personalmente los conciertos no me gustaron nada comenta la cantautora silvia penide me parece que estaban todos orientados a un mismo p blico
7414892 deber an hacer m s espect culos en los barrios para obligarnos a recorrer y conocer la ciudad
7414893 en fiestas la ciudad deber a ser como un estallido
7414894 deber a facilitarse a todo el mundo que disfrute de las fiestas
7414895 en realidad el abanico de actividades est cubierto pero hay mucho que se puede mejorar
7414896 creo que por fin despu s de tantos a os est n aprendiendo e hicieron un programa de fiestas bastante intensas y muy participativas hay actividades en todos lados permanentemente y aunque se sigue un poco con lo de siempre se a aden cosas interesante como es verbas na r a quiz s lo malo es que se centra todo en mar a pita en lugar de en los barrios de los vecinos
7414897 hay un mont n de cosas y creo que el abanico est cubierto pero me gustar a que hubiese cine al aire libre en diferentes barrios de la ciudad y que no todo quede concentrado en la playa y en el centro tenemos espacios abiertos muy buenos como los parques de santa margarita y europa promover actividades ah ayuda a que los coru eses recorran la ciudad
7414898 me parece que no hay propuestas muy diferentes a otros a os es un poco m s de lo mismo la programaci n musical est toda orientada a un p blico determinado y pocas cosas me llamaron la atenci n deber an promover m s actividades urbanas y m s variedad ferias mercadillos teatro en la calle durante las fiestas la ciudad deber a ser como un estallido
7414899 ech de menos el concierto de madonna pero era muy dif cil que viniera y en lugar de ese hubo otros que lo compensaron con chambao y mal disfrut intensamente los fuegos artificiales fueron incre bles lo nico que mejorar a es el transporte hasta las zonas de fiesta lo facilitar a para que todo el mundo pudiera acercarse y disfrutar porque todos tenemos derecho

7414902 ha sido uno de los mejores partidos que he visto he jugado y podr ver jugar en el baloncesto espa ol pero habr que cambiar las reglas porque ha habido cosas que no entend amos sobre todo los pasos que son reglas fiba no reglas nba
7414903 han hecho cosas que hasta en la nba ser an pasos
7414904 ha estado cerquita he hecho un campeonato malo y es una l stima que cuando he jugado bien hemos perdido
7414905 ha sido una buena despedida no la hay mejor posible tras este partidazo estoy muy orgulloso de estos a os y ahora es el momento de que entre gente nueva
7414906 hemos tenido buenas sensaciones y buen juego y ya no se les ve a tan sobrados y ni tan prepotentes como en la fase de grupos
7414907 espero que no sea el ltimo partido con la selecci n
7414908 hace dos a os los ve a por la tele y era un sue o ahora sigue siendo un sue o pero si a los jugadores les tengo que hacer una falta se la hago
7414909 el esp ritu que ha tenido el equipo y el apoyo que se han dado todos los deportistas
7414910 el n mero de medallas con dos oros m s que en atenas quiere decir que el deporte espa ol ha progresado no es comparable el n mero de medallas ganadas en atenas a las de pek n por la espectacular actuaci n de china que ha hecho desplazarse a otros pa ses en el medallero

7414917 un pescado muy socorrido por el consumidor infantil y por la gente mayor
7414918 creemos en el rock and roll por eso estamos aqu equivocados o no
7414919 un prestigio social por estar con una persona m s joven
7414920 la necesidad de suplir carencias afectivas provenientes de una figura paterna ausente
7414921 ella busca la frescura y el dinamismo del joven su mayor facilidad para el afecto la presencia de ilusiones intactas en el amor y en la vida y el apogeo sexual y a veces una necesidad velada por parte de la mujer madura de dominar de no quedarse soltera y de ejercer de cuidadora abnegada
7414922 la estabilidad emocional la seguridad personal independencia y la comprensi n de la mujer adulta
7414923 cuando hablamos de placer y de deseo tenemos que olvidarnos del concepto cl sico y equivocado de rendimiento competitividad y resultados que muchas veces creemos que marca la diferencia entre disfrutar o no
7414924 hay quien te lo dice directamente vengo a por la foto pero en el 90 de los casos las madres se realizan esta ecograf a para ver el estado de salud el peque o
7414925 da detalles de c mo abren y cierran los pu os de los p rpados el llanto y esto es muy til para apreciar si existe alg n problema neurol gico en el ni o
7414926 es una prueba complementaria la ecograf a en dos dimensiones es b sica ya que ofrece im genes del interior del cuerpo del feto de sus rganos es evidente que si hay que realizar s lo una la id nea es la 2d
7414927 el 80 de la informaci n del estado de salud del feto lo da la ecograf a cl sica la de cuatro dimensiones s lo nos ofrece el 20 restante
7414928 hay hospitales que si detectan alguna anomal a en la 2d tienen una unidad especial con el aparato de cuatro dimensiones pero en la comunidad gallega no hay ninguno
7414929 el realismo de las im genes da tranquilidad a los familiares y aumenta el lazo afectivo entre los padres y el hijo
7414930 al detectarse un peque o problema el comandante decidi aterrizar con total normalidad en el aeropuerto de m laga

7414944 today all of canada mourns the deaths of three brave soldiers killed in the line of duty in afghanistan
7414945 these soldiers made an important contribution to international efforts in afghanistan aimed at creating the conditions necessary for reconstruction and development efforts to flourish in a country ravaged by decades of war and despotism
7414946 canada and our nato allies are making a profound difference in the lives of the afghan people
7414947 despite this tragic event we remain undeterred in our mission to help afghans rebuild their country
7414948 trafficked across the border from pakistan with her 3 year old son rukhma was handed to an afghan who raped and abused her then beat the toddler to death as she watched helplessly
7414949 the teenager had been married at a young age to an abusive husband and ran away with a boy from her neighbourhood ostracised from her family and village saliha was convicted of escaping from home and illegal sexual relations the first carries a maximum penalty of 10 years the second 20 these are two of the most common accusations facing female prisoners in afghanistan two thirds of the women in lashkar gahs medieval looking jail have been convicted of illegal sexual relations but most are simply rape victims mirroring the situation nationwide the system does not distinguish between those who have been attacked and those who have chosen to run off with a man
7414950 so would you rather be hit in the mouth or in your nether regions
7414951 in case you missed it this week there was a tragedy in kansas ten thousand people died an entire town destroyed
7414952 over the last 15 months weve traveled to every corner of the united states ive now been in 57 states i think one left to go
7414953 there was something stirring across the country because of what happened in selma alabama because some folks are willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born
7414954 we only have a certain number of them and if they are all in iraq then its harder for us to use them in afghanistan
7414955 ive made it clear for years that the threat from iran is grave
7414956 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
7414957 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
7414958 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals
7414959 im pleased with how today has gone and the improvements weve made since practice yesterday my race pace on the airwaves ducati isnt too far away from the rest so tomorrow should definitely be interesting in an ideal world it would have been good to have had a dry practice session this morning but weve still got warm up tomorrow to kick up a gear ahead of the races
7414960 im really happy to be on the front row for airwaves ducati and to get under 1 minute 27 for the first time this weekend i owe it to everyone in the airwaves ducati team who have worked so hard i could go full gas on the limit the whole time and thats why im here and why i love my job im feeling confident about tomorrow as we know we have a good race pace but how well we do will be down to how fast the rest of the field can go and for how long
7414961 i just bumped into busch and moved him out of the way
7414962 thats not the best way to win a race this is nascar racing and i wanted to win real bad
7414963 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me
7414964 and he has before so thats the way it goes
7414965 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7414966 its nice to be able to redeem yourself in a seven day period
7414967 its funny hawley comes up to me before the final and says jack i want you to completely get out of your mind what happened last weekend dont even think about that i said frank we dont teach mind games at the school were not supposed to be doing that
7414968 imagine being a little league player and you get to pitch against mickey mantle frank hawley has been all of that to the sport to have him come back in adds a whole other dimension to this and hell no i wasnt going to cut him any slack
7414969 like the last thing we needed was another tough funny car i was so happy for him when he won his rounds and he was happy for me all the way up to the final round so that was cool it was just a fairy tale weekend it really was
7414970 the valvoline mts dodge guys gave me such a great consistent race car
7414971 a couple of times it wanted to move over toward the centerline but it was a pretty smooth car all weekend long didnt throw us any curve balls out there
7414972 crew chief johnny west is a very conservative by nature type of guy so he and assistant crew chief tommy delago balance each other well and i think now that weve been consistent for a few races were starting to get quick and i think if we can take that to cold weather tracks we will be contending for the championship
7414973 theres a lot of mixed emotions the valvoline mts dodge has been running really good its like austin coil john forces crew chief told me a long time ago everybody tells you youve done a real good job when you win weve been doing the same job we just finally had good results the biggest part is the entire schumacher group and all the people at the shop and the guys who build the chassis thats the nucleus of the whole operation i just came in and brought a little continuity and thats what probably helped make this thing turn the corner outside of that i really havent done anything different than what ive normally done my whole life
7414974 it feels really good we know what it feels like to win early on in the year and we know what it feels like to struggle quite a bit and have a little bit of a slump since johnny west has come on board and started working with ed ace mcculloch napa crew chief and theyve been working together it seems like things are making a turn for the better
7414975 for both tony and jack to come out on top and the teams do what theyre supposed to do was terrific what a bunch of fantastic people im fortunate enough to have and to have sponsors like the u s army valvoline and mail terminal services on board and matco tools and all our other great sponsors its a great weekend
7414976 paul finebaum has done more to change the face of sports journalism in the state of alabama than any other individual
7414977 this time 10 years ago we were just a week away from the season opener against syracuse
7414978 i was just beginning to feel that it was my team you have to realize that for my first two years at tennessee it was peytons manning team i couldnt really ask questions in position meetings because i wasnt the guy who was going to play on saturday finally i knew that this was my team i was the leader i was the quarterback i would be a huge part of how good or bad we were going to be as a team
7414979 jonathan does have an advantage over where i was at this time hes at least played some meaningful snaps he was forced to play against lsu and arkansas two years ago when ainge was hurt hes been there for a while he knows the personnel
7414980 its a big adjustment for him because now he gets to say what hes thinking and he gets to ask what he wants to ask he gets to tell the coaches that he doesnt like a play and would feel more comfortable running something else it is critical that the offensive coordinator and quarterback think alike and the only way that can happen is for both to be able to open and honest with each other for the first time in his career jonathan is having the opportunity to be open and honest about how he feels
7414981 you have to realize that i played for multiple coordinators just like jonathan i sat behind a four year starter just like jonathan and i had my frustrations playing the waiting game just like jonathan
7414982 there was a lot going through my head when i sat behind peyton
7414983 my maturity really began that sophomore year my freshman year i didnt ask peyton many questions but that sophomore year i was asking him things all the time and he was great about helping me along peyton was a great friend and has been over the years
7414984 what gave me confidence was the orange bowl in that sophomore season we didnt know if peyton was going to play or not leading up to the game so i prepared as though i was going to play as it turned out i got in late after the game had already been decided i remember going into the huddle and the guys looked at me and said ok lets go it wasnt like i was the backup they looked at me like it was my team i think the success i had in that game gave me the confidence i needed heading into the offseason
7414985 i think that fourth down against syracuse was a big one
7414986 to be real honest our defense was so fast that it made the games seem like they were in slow motion
7414987 the other big play in that game was the shawn bryson touchdown run it was a big play for me because i audibled into that play i read the defense and switched into that play not many people know that but our preparation taught me to make that audible against auburn that year my stats were horrible but there were a number of audibles that i made that helped us win the game
7414988 yeah i know i sound like a coach i feel real good about how we can be on offense this year
7414989 the repair of the dam is estimated to cost 16 million
7414990 last year we were told that the money was appropriated but the city had to come up with a 35 percent local match to obtain the funds
7414991 at the time with the councils approval i wrote a letter to our representatives asking them to do what they could to help us obtain the federal funds with a lower local match
7414992 i was told it is too late to receive the money this year but they would get next years appropriations
7414993 water rates were going up and the administration and council saw the purchase of the dam as a way to stem the increasing costs of obtaining water and perhaps earn revenue by selling water to other communities
7414994 however they later learned the cost of placing a filtration plant at the lakes would be cost prohibitive
7414995 in todays dollars it would cost around 16 million to repair the dam
7414996 this is a way for us all to come together and help
7414997 his goal right now is to get out of the hospital
7414998 but im not putting any boundaries on him hes not that kind of person
7414999 we showed them a picture so they could see how he was
7415000 thats all they cared about it was a beautiful moment
7415001 we tried to tailgate during the season but it was like 30 degrees
7415002 we are going to throw the football and set up the run by throwing the football
7415003 it gives us a few more things we can do bootleg people are coming when were in the gun all the time so weve got to neutralize that it will be a game plan thing we could be under center or under the gun the whole game
7415004 in the gun your running game is really limited and we need to run a little more you bring in six dbs were going to run you bring in plenty of linebackers were going to throw
7415005 the best part about this scrimmage is that it lets us create as close to a game like atmosphere as possible especially for having so many freshmen
7415006 in the past weve often tried to divide the teams into two even teams today we felt it would be better for our young players to play a lineup similar to the one starting on friday night to do that in front of a crowd really helps with a game like atmosphere

7415012 tonight is a particular honor for me because lets face it my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely
7415013 i knew i needed a break and he gave it to me all i can do is force him to run hard and he made a mistake im lucky
7415014 it was good right up until whatever lap that was where i made a mistake
7415015 it came out from underneath me there and i had to check up or i would have spun out
7415016 its good when you can be frustrated with second but we did give one away today when you look at it it was obvious
7415017 this season weve really risen toward the top and we compete week in and week out with the best in the series
7415018 felipe has had an extraordinary weekend yesterday he was very quick in qualifying and today he drove in impeccable style without putting a foot wrong to take what was a very well deserved win after the disappointment of budapest i want to compliment him and the whole team who have worked so hard in preparing for this event unfortunately once again we have suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races now we must continue to push tothe maximum to develop the car and improve reliability in order to be as well prepared as possible for the forthcoming races we still have two test sessions at monza and then jerez and a lot of hard days work in the factory finally i want to say a few words about piero timpini our mechanic unfortunately injured in kimis second pit stop his first words were to say sorry as though the incident was his fault it is thanks to the passion dedication and professionalism that these guys show on a daily basis for ferrari how special is our team
7415019 its fantastic having won this race especially after the disappointment of budapest the team did an amazing job in preparing for this grand prix and the benefits of that could be seen right from the very first day yesterday i got pole and today the win with the race fastest lap as the icing on the cake you cannot ask for more especially at my one hundredth grand prix with every single one of them powered by a ferrari engine i got a good start and i pushed to the maximum right from the early laps in the second part of the race the car was exceptional but also in the final stint when i had the softer tyres i could do the lap times easily this is an important moment in my career and i must continue to work in this way i am sorry for what happened to kimi we have to look very carefully at our reliability i am confident the team knows which countermeasures to take to react to this issue as it hasalways done in the past
7415020 not much to say after a day like this it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and sixty points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated today i lost a place at the startand i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance
7415021 a great performance from felipe all weekend long he was fantastic and deserves all our praise unfortunately yet again we were not reliable both from a technical point of view and in how we operated on the track given what happened during raikkonens pit stop and then the failure of his engine which initial investigations seem to point at a similar failure to the one felipe experienced in hungary fortunately pietro timpini the mechanic operating the refueling injured at kimis second stop got away with just a small fracture to the left foot and it is not particularly serious today we have seen two sides of the coin we have agreat potential from both the team and the car capable of putting us in front of everyone else but if not all elements are operating at their optimum then we are throwing away precious points that could cost us dear we must work to remedy these problems and thats what we will do starting in the days that follow
7415022 congratulations to the city of valencia for providing formula one with such a good race venue today we saw a strong race which was exciting on this very high speed street course we must congratulate felipe massa and ferrari for winning the 200th grand prix in which bridgestone haveparticipated since 1997 there were many results worthy of mention today both toyotas scored points and both toro rosso cars finished in the top ten so well done to those teams both the softand super soft compounds worked very well here which is a credit to our engineers who selected this allocation for this new race destination even in the high temperatures seen today at this fast track the super soft was capable of being used in a one stop soft super soft strategy as seen by timo glock we now start the count towards our next hundred races
7415023 i cant complain with second place today this was a strong weekend for us despite my having a few problems health wise but we pulled through the track was pretty difficult to overtake on but i maintained the gap our lap times showed that our overall pace was good which was encouraging heikki and i scored 13 points today which is very positive for the team so id describe it as a satisfactory weekend for us
7415024 my start was good and i was consequently able to overtake kimi before the first corner however im not really happy with how the race went for me after that because i had grip problems with the prime tyres in the first and second stints whereas with the option tyres in the last stint i had much better grip and traction as a result i could close the gap to robert kubica a little at least i scored five points but a podium would have been much nicer having said that its good that the team scored a lot of points with lewiss second place and my fourth place
7415025 we saw another extremely solid vodafone mclaren mercedes team performance today the result of which was a very useful clutch of championship points but in truth we lost the chance of outright victory yesterday in qualifying in my view its pretty clear that if lewis had qualified with the same level of fuel as felipe hed probably have been able to control the race from the front but the nature of the circuit dictated that it was always going to be difficult for him to overtake today and that being the case we opted fairly early on to take the championship strategic option of settling for second place following on from his victory in hungary heikki also drove very strongly and helped bolster our points total in the constructors championship he responded well to the pressure applied by kimi and thoroughly deserved his fourth place
7415026 i am quite satisfied lewis leads the drivers world championship six points ahead of felipe and 13 ahead of kimi no other team scored more points than we did today we reduced the gap in the constructors and extended the lead in the drivers rankings congratulations to felipe and ferrari on their strong race and victory the first grand prix here in valencia was a great premiere thank you to the organisers and to bernie this grand prix most certainly set an example the most positive element was that the boxes containing our spare parts were kept closed all weekend we didnt need to fit a single replacement part throughout a race weekend that everybody thought might be full of crashes we will now continue to work hard in order to be well prepared for the final third of the season which will begin with back to back races at spa and monza two particularly challenging circuits that will put maximum stress on the engines
7415027 its fantastic having won this race especially after the disappointment of budapest the team did an amazing job in preparing for this grand prix and the benefits of that could be seen right from the very first day yesterday i got pole and today the win with the race fastest lap as the icing on the cake you cannot ask for more especially at my one hundredth grand prix with every single one of them powered by a ferrari engine i got a good start and i pushed to the maximum right from the early laps in the second part of the race the car was exceptional but also in the final stint when i had the softer tyres i could do the lap times easily this is an important moment in my career and i must continue to work in this way i am sorry for what happened to kimi we have to look very carefully at our reliability i am confident the team knows which countermeasures to take to react to this issue as it has always done in the past
7415028 i cant complain with second place today this was a strong weekend for us despite my having a few problems health wise but we pulled through the track was pretty difficult to overtake on but i maintained the gap our lap times showed that our overall pace was good which was encouraging heikki kovalainen and i scored 13 points today which is very positive for the team so id describe it as a satisfactory weekend for us
7415029 i started pretty well but in corner one i went over the kerb and lewis was closing in the second corner i was going to overtake lewis but i saw felipe braking quite early it would have been too much of a risk as i could end up overshooting the braking point and crashing into him over the next few laps i was consistently a bit slower than lewis suddenly i saw a white plastic bag flying across the track but could not avoid it and it went under the car i couldnt steer for two corners which was extremely dangerous fortunately most of the bag soon flew away but my confidence was very low over the next sector and i lost around three seconds in the end i finished third eventually i think my good qualifying result yesterday was crucial for todays result
7415030 not much to say after a day like this it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and sixty points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated today i lost a place at the start and i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance
7415031 after qualifying yesterday i knew that me weekend was going to be difficult at the start i was touched by nakajima and i lost my rear wing my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue but my race was already compromised i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for the supporters who came here this weekend to support me i now want to concentrate on the rest to the season and the next race in spa

7415042 when you look at all the injuries and adversity weve had to put up with it might have caught up with us
7415043 injuries arent an excuse every team has them we can go in two directions we can pout or we can battle and make some good adjustments
7415044 ive never been north but im at chelsea for two seasons so i must get used to bolton manchester united manchester city what i expected i saw today it was difficult winning 1 0 away from home in england is the same as winning 10 0 elsewhere wigan played better than portsmouth and had players who are healthy have power and pressured us i know we didnt play as well as we did last week but i understand the reasons why
7415045 if a player did not want to play for me i know what id do id drive him myself to wherever he wants to go just to get rid of him sometimes youve got to lose to win two years ago when i got my job i had a player and i heard he had been speaking to another club so i just sold him i said you can go and he went ok and off he popped the manager has to be the most powerful

7415053 dimitar berbatov will complete an acrimonious move from tottenham hotspur to manchester united within days berbatovs arrival at old trafford will delight sir alex ferguson who has been desperate to sign a top class forward to compete with wayne rooney and carlos t vez louis saha will be allowed to leave the club with as roma and as monaco having joined sunderland in expressing an interest while ferguson is waiting to hear whether manucho the angola forward will receive the work permit that he needs to play or the club
7415054 united have made it clear they will pay the 25m asking price and offer berbatov 90 000 a week but want spurs chairman levy to drop his claim they made an illegal approach levy had accused united boss sir alex ferguson of arrogance and hypocrisy for his pursuit of berbatov but the premier league want more evidence for the second time this season levy is facing the prospect of having to drop a complaint he stood down in his row with liverpool to allow robbie keane to move to anfield and will have to do so again to cash in on berbatov
7415055 united have also told spurs that they must drop their complaint to the premier league alleging that they had inappropriately pursued the bulgarian international
7415056 spurs representatives were in argentina at the weekend to watch the 22 year old striker falcao full name radamel falcao garcia zarate score for river plate in their defeat to banfield spurs accept that they need to buy at least two strikers if berbatov is sold after a disastrous start to the season
7415057 ramos wants berbatov out of the club as quickly as possible the former sevilla coach has already identified dutch international huntelaar as the ideal replacement and believes he can push through a 20m deal this week but spurs also refuse to rule out a possible 10m move for england and wigan striker emile heskey if berbatov goes in the next few days
7415058 arsenals opening offer of 10 million was turned down three weeks ago but after such a lacklustre performance wenger knows that he has to make a significant move in the transfer market if arsenal are to be challengers for the barclays premier league and champions league wenger has money to spend after a quiet summer in the transfer market the arsenal manager has spent about 18 million on samir nasri aaron ramsey and amaury bischoff to boost his midfield options but none of those players is the finished article
7415059 the visitors pointed to the lack of fitness of michael essien michael ballack and frank lampard and to the absence of the injured mikel john obi he also lost ashley cole to a dead leg but in truth the visitors were winded less by their own ailments and more by wigans aggressive energy steve bruce had seen his own fan out to various corners of the globe for midweek internationals his hondurans wilson palacios and maynor figueroa were in mexico his egyptian amr zaki in sudan but they tore into this contest unperturbed zaki outstanding throughout twice forced petr cech to claw away rasping drives the substitute olivier kapo did likewise in the final exchanges
7415060 deco symbolises what scolari craves from his team technique and character as well as stirring admiration for the effortless way he guided the ball around cattermole in the first half and then nut megging him for good measure in the second deco also impressed with his relish for the physical side of the game no shrinking violet the portuguese international put in a stiff tackle on antonio valencia and bulldozed into a challenge on cattermole but it was his clever free kick after four minutes that inevitably guaranteed him the headlines when cattermole handled just outside the hosts box deco stood with ashley cole and watched wigan arrange their wall in training deco has apparently been placing every free kick to the right he changed tack here sweeping it over the wall and in to the left
7415061 how do deco frank lampard michael ballack michael essien and joe cole co exist in the same team with difficulty it would appear deco delivered a second special goal in as many games a glorious free kick to defeat wigan but that should not camouflage a disjointed display only deco the greatest source of invention approached his best essien proved admirably disciplined but was stymied as an attacking force for much of the match he resembled a third central defender and indeed there were times when the ghanaian was the last man
7415062 the imminent departure of andriy shevchenko and the anticipated arrival of robinho illustrate how ruthless and how costly the russian wheel turns at the london club chelsea their talents are as different as their backgrounds shevchenko is a quiet determined deep individual shaped by his boyhood when at 9 years of age he was evacuated from his home near the site of the chernobyl nuclear disaster robinho is a party animal who can dance limbo on the disco floor and on a crowded field where the ukrainian appeared born to score goals until he reached chelsea the brazilian has a repertoire that can score them make them or simply thrill an audience by doing the unexpected chelseas wheel turns again expensively
7415063 welcome back andriy shevchenko now weve got the pleasantries over with what exactly are you doing here i know youre a seasoned hitman who could provide milan with the finishing they have so sorely been lacking since your departure but last we heard you slammed the door in our face with the lamest excuse in the history of football really an english tutor wouldve been cheaper than forcing a 30m transfer to chelsea not to mention considerably better for your career i hope you have learned from this horrible mistake that listening to the wife is not always the best idea
7415064 praise of citys performance should come with the caveat that west ham united were awful even before they lost mark noble to a red card in the 37th minute for a second bookable offence but this was the kind of display that hughes had been looking for after a 4 2 defeat away to aston villa in his first barclays premier league match in charge
7415065 steven gerrard is a brilliant player but he cannot start on the left of midfield brilliant but he does not like it on the right either brilliant yet uncomfortable behind the striker brilliant but obviously cannot play in the same team as frank lampard brilliant but he must have gareth barry beside him for such a brilliant player gerrards champions spend an awful lot of time telling the world what he cannot do almost as much as they expend detailing the precise conditions in which he must operate in the centre like roy of the rovers with the england team built around him now there was a chap who tried that oh you must remember him ginger lad nice smile carried an umbrella not been around for a while
7415066 fc united of manchester were formed in 2005 by fans who refused to support manchester united after the glazer family took control at old trafford and their success on and off the pitch has been just as remarkable as the achievements of cristiano ronaldo and his team mates during the past three years after three promotions in three seasons fc united have worked their way up to the unibond league premier division the seventh level in the english game and this afternoon will take on boston united who before financial meltdown were playing in coca cola league two as recently as may last year another three promotions and fc united will be rubbing shoulders with the big boys in the football league
7415067 on the night the beijing games closing ceremony took place it emerged that lord coe has made a concrete proposal for sir alex ferguson to become the great britain manager coach though coe the chairman of the london games organising committee cannot himself force through a move to have a team gb side in the football competition in four years time his position is an influential one alongside browns increasingly public support for the move
7415068 football at the olympics is a little bit like inviting george clooney out for a night with your mates everyone quickly recognises the fact that he is cooler wealthier and far more handsome than the rest of you and while he may draw some attention to your crew in your heart of hearts you know he doesnt quite fit and so knowingly or not you ostracise him and he ends up feeling uncomfortable knowingly or not you knock him down a few pegs football got the same treatment in beijing in terms of aggregate audience it blew all the other sports out of the water but that did not stop it from being treated like some kind of interloper while we were inundated with heart warming stories about how hard gymnasts skeet shooters and badminton players worked to attain their olympic goals and how grateful they all were to their respective federations who got them training facilities sponsorships and time off work you got the sense that footballs powers that be wished this tournament had never taken place

7415076 the forcible relocation of over 10 000 dineh navajo people is a tragedy of genocide and injustice that will be a blot on the conscience of this country for many generations
7415077 i feel that in relocating these elderly people we are as bad as the nazis that ran the concentration camps in world war ii
7415078 i believe that the forced relocation of navajo and hopi people that followed from the passage in 1974 of public law 93 531 is a major violation of these peoples human rights indeed this forced relocation of over 12 000 native americans is one of the worst cases of involuntary community resettlement that i have studied throughout the world over the past 40 years

7415084 they intended their book to usher in the end of the current civilization which had been rushing headlong towards disaster over the previous decades it was all foreseen in spengler and his birth and death cycles of culture and civilization the end was nigh and they would write an apocalyptic satire to condemn the age which had become dominated by spritual suicide and inhumanity it would be called the last book the last book of the bible is revelation vision of the apocalypse to which the title referred
7415085 we have evolved a new cosmogony of literature boris fraenkel and i it is to be a new bible the last book all those who have anything to say will say it here anonymously we will exhaust the age after us not another book not for a generation at least
7415086 make the last book the first of a series a life job like prousts
7415087 i think i have discovered a title for the book
7415088 the tropic of cancer i said slowly and solemnly is not a medical book the title i answered is a symbolic title the tropic of cancer is a name given in text books to a temperate zone lying above the equator below the equator you have the tropic of capricorn which is the south temperate zone the book of course has nothing to do with the climatic conditions either unless it be a sort of mental climate cancer is a name which has always intrigued me youll find it in zodiacal lore too etymologically it comes from chancre meaning crab in chinese symbolism it is a sign of great importance the crab is the only living creature which can walk backwards and forwards and sideways with equal facility of course my book doesnt treat all of this explicitly its a novel or rather an autobiographical document
7415089 cancer also means for me the disease of civilization the extreme point of realization along the wrong path hence the necessity to change ones course and begin all over again
7415090 a symbolic title i had chosen for a number of reasons primarily because the cancer is the crab and the crab has the power or the ability to walk backwards forwards sideways any direction do you see i liked that symbol you know able to go any direction at will do you see
7415091 grows inside you like a cancer and grows and grows until you are eaten away
7415092 you are evil in the way that microbes are evil like cancer leprosy or the coming of puberty
7415093 opposite cancer in the zodiac extremes of the equinox turning points is capricorn the house in which i was born which is religious and represents in death
7415094 i had no thought of the next title but when i came to the next one i thought well why not make it tropic of capricorn you see i was going to try to have one for just the equator well finally i had made black spring that had another great significance to me but there was always the astrological implication too sure

7415103 it was a little bit of a shame to fight with him in the pit lane because he would have had to have let me pass
7415104 we came so close to the wall and i had to back off which cost me a bit of time fortunately the gap was enough to go on and win the race
7415105 obviously im disappointed our expectations were much different from where we finished in qualifications today were working on it the delphi national guard car was very fast in practice yesterday and we were just a few ticks away from advancing to the second round today like always a lot can happen in the race tomorrow and were looking forward to it
7415106 that was a good result and a great performance by the team the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i could drive a strong race without attacking much i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7415107 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship
7415108 this has turned into one of those good weekends after qualifying everybody was a bit disappointed but today went much better due to excellent teamwork after jarno missed saturdays practice session the crew put timos set up into jarnos car and he delivered a very good performance and a very smooth race to 5th place today timo was not feeling well but he made an excellent start managed his tyres well and put in a huge effort to complete this race with the best result im very happy that we are confirming our good pace now we will push to keep these results coming with a particular eye on the japanese grand prix later in the season
7415109 this weekend our medium compound has worked very very well degradation has been good and near tothe final lap in the feature race maldonado and pantano got under 1 minute 47 seconds there are tworeasons for this the tyre worked well and the circuit improved more over the weekend than most circuits asit is a brand new venue i believe it is very quick for a street circuit although the big changes from low tohigh speeds made fuel consumption much worse than anyone expected
7415110 that was a pretty good qualifying session and i have to be happy with my second pole position of the season the new qualifying format certainly makes it all action and we didnt have much of break to think it was a case of get out on track and give it your all
7415111 we did a bit of work on the steering and brakes during the first eliminator as we were safely through and found a little bit of an improvement to be honest my rizla suzuki is working well and i am confident i cant wait for the races to start i want to see if we can add to the tally of wins
7415112 i am happy with lap time but make some mistakes i still learning this track it is not the easiest with many hills and narrow tarmac but i like anyway
7415113 i feel recharged for racing after my podium at suzuka eight hour race and visit home to japan i want a strong finish to the season to show british fans what atsu can really achieve
7415114 i am chuffed to bits with toms performance he is riding really well supported by a fantastic team and riding a well sorted rizla suzuki race bike this is the real tom sykes and the real rizla suzuki that everyone is seeing right now
7415115 atsu i am really pleased with he is showing his best form at a difficult technical track and his potential is clear he has a great starting position and we will be looking for fireworks from him in the races
7415116 the new qualifying format was a breath of fresh air for riders the team and fans it certainly kept us on our toes and i think it was really exciting i hope it continues for the rest of the season
7415117 incredible a perfect day it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice racetrack my start was not so good on the dirty side and going into turn 1 i was right onthe limit and very close to kimi and could defend my position against jarno for thefirst stint but he had a bit more fuel on board and stayed out an extra lap and heovertook me in the pits but we can be very very happy with this result we made nomistakes no mistakes all weekend and maximised our performance the wholeteam can be very proud of what it has achieved and hopefully for the next races wecan be in the top ten again
7415118 that was a very nice race apart from the fact that i touched with heidfeld whichbroke my wing which was a real shame as i had to do 17 laps like that losingaround 20 seconds to the group i was in the next two stints were good quality and ihad a good pace but i am happy with the result and i think we had the rightstrategy its my best result since australia and especially from the second stintonwards i felt much more comfortable and confident with the car and felt i couldpush as the track rubbered in as for the next races i continue to tackle them one ata time and hope that next time out in spa i can make it into the points
7415119 all weekend the team has performed excellently we ended upwith both our drivers finishing where they started in sixth and tenth places which isa solid result as all the top teams apart from ferrari had both their cars finish vettelhad a good start considering he was on the dirty side of the track but a touch withraikkonen left him with some vibration from the front left wheel and his second stinthe had a bit of graining bourdais also drove a good race and also performed wellthrough the weekend we have shown that our performance is improving from raceto race and so we are looking forward to spa and monza i am convinced that bothof these races especially monza will suit our package for scuderia toro rossoand our red bull parent company this has been a really successful weekend
7415120 it was great that the motorola car was able to make it into the fast 12 i cant believe how close the times were of course i wish that we would have been able to make it into the firestone fast six but we are headed in the right direction hopefully we can keep the car up front and out of trouble throughout the race
7415121 we were one change behind in the firestone fast six we tried everything and as a team weve come a long way weve been struggling on the road courses so im glad to see the team 7 eleven car in the top four at infineon you dont want to start worse than the second row

7415131 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7415132 because id never written songs before we didnt know what the rules were
7415133 we didnt know you shouldnt write about the tasteless things going around in your head
7415134 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive
7415135 the joke of it is that hes so damaged and hes trying to be so honest with his feelings but hes so limited with his abilities that it ends up being completely inappropriate
7415136 hes the son of god and i think thats cool
7415137 so why do i feel like ive been raped in the face
7415138 it maybe came out of frustration because we had seen so many musicals and we were trying to do something that was really funny
7415139 im not pretending these songs are as good as any musical ever
7415140 i hope people will think theyre a breath of fresh air
7415141 however mistaken he might be hes really passionate hes not cynical
7415142 hes trying to do something hes trying to make a difference and thats what underpins some of the dumb stuff in it
7415143 it was eerie but on the other hand when looking at it from stauffenbergs viewpoint and what he did and what these men did it was powerful
7415144 as an actor i think i can say for all of us who were there that we felt fortunate to get those locations and shoot at those places it really changes the performances to do it there at that spot
7415145 these guys are true american patriots they were fighting two wars
7415146 they were fighting the nazis the fascists in europe and fighting the japanese in the pacific and they were fighting jim crow racism prejudice in the united states of america at the same time
7415147 i love the idea of it it applied to where bond was at the end of the last movie
7415148 the one thing he didnt have with the relationship was that quantum of solace
7415149 its rare where you get a piece of material thats politically pertinent like this but also sort of non preachy and engaging entertainment for an audience
7415150 he doesnt want to be a monster he doesnt want to kill people
7415151 he loves her but if he gets too passionate he will want her blood he will want to kill her
7415152 doing those type of scenes is always a bit strange never mind a husband but an entire crew watching you
7415153 this was two lone wolves its a duel two complicated fascinating really brilliant people
7415154 for men with their histories their intelligence their egos a contest like this really did become kind of life and death
7415155 they say it in the piece there can be only one winner
7415156 were telling it while hes still in office which has never been done
7415157 the bush family is a political dynasty in america its the closest thing we have to a political dynasty other than john adams and john quincy adams weve never had father and son presidents like this before

7415166 but bread and butter issues are just as important as political issues to those with young families they are concerned about rising costs jobs and incomes
7415167 they have enabled spammers to push down their costs through economies of scale and eliminated the need for spammers to host their own spam servers as they simply take control of other peoples computers instead
7415168 recent fbi prosecutions of bot herders and investigations of message boards used by spammers suggests the going rate for spammers to send a million spam messages is as little as 5 10
7415169 it was the perfect week the perfect races couldnt ask for anything else
7415170 hard to imagine but this is a great start its going to be amazing im kind of at a loss for words because i was like oh you know i wonder how many people are going to be there im staring down this street of people just packed together its one of the coolest things ive ever experienced
7415171 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7415172 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7415173 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7415174 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7415175 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7415176 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters
7415177 im not complaining still have town hall meetings still able to do 95 percent of what i did before
7415178 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
7415179 we have no doubt the refereeing and judging is clean honest and transparent but we need higher standards
7415180 its true that we havent won a gold medal but im not aware of any problems with the team and im sure that in future competitions well be able to win many gold medals
7415181 i dont think nate costa is going to be available this week well know more about his long term prognosis either later today or sometime sunday i dont know for sure when our doctor is going to be back to examine him im not rulling nate out but at this point hes doubtful for this game
7415182 im totally comfortable with our quarterbacks justin roper played well in the two games he played last year and actually in our last two scrimmages hes been our best quarterback in terms of performance jeremiah masoli is fresh off leading his team to a national championship chris harper is a tremendous athlete a guy who is as good as anybody weve ever had here with the ball in his hands theyre all a little bit different but i like that group they are still a work in progress and until we win a football game there will be questions but i think justin has already won a football game and already tied a sun bowl game record and had his first pass in college go for a td so those are rather strong beginnings
7415183 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7415184 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7415185 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7415186 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7415187 thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7415188 i think they could have held out for a little bit more
7415189 i think there were important compromises made by both parties
7415190 my hope is thats going to give us all the opportunity to focus on the incredible work thats going on in our schools and our classrooms

7415223 to ensure we would be in a position to get the settings right and provide continuity during a difficult period
7415224 nothing changed expect to the extent that when we extended mikes contract we believed and we were absolutely right that we were entering a very difficult environment
7415225 we wanted to have the option of security of tenure we also wanted mike to get the setting right for us as we got into the storm
7415226 we believe weve probably passed through the eye of the storm
7415227 weve had that continuity and weve now come to an agreement with mike that he step down

7415252 the representative then convinced the resident to give her credit card details to verify she held a mastercard or visa and told her that no one could debit money from an account without the 3 digit code on the back of the card
7415253 this is clearly misleading and i urge canberrans not to respond to offers deals or requests for their personal details
7415254 when the resident checked her credit card the following day nearly 600 had been withdrawn from the account and when she attempted to call the number the representative had given her it was not connected

7415296 got a bit exuberant about the numbers were not going to impose costs like 50 a week on motorists
7415297 you get to choose the balance and theres no way that we are going to be imposing a 50 cost on motorists i think the level of tolling that the governments talking about on puhoi a motorway extention north of auckland which is about 2 is more reasonable
7415298 if theres going to be tolling where they are paying then government should be looking at whether it can offset that by lower petrol prices
7415299 while nationals ability to issue policies only to have to issue corrections and clarifications of those policies within 24 hours is a source of amusement it is also alarming that a major political party is unwilling to be clear about its real agenda

7415321 when i was working for the music video division of a production company radical media tyra banks had just launched her talk show and it became the only talk show that spoke directly to younger women but her topics rarely addressed issues that teens or college students specifically face each day her show has entered into this realm since its launch in 2005 but there is still a need for an outlet that is strictly for teens by teens we are that outlet
7415322 i would like to see teen diaries initiate several community based projects that empower young women with the tools that are necessary to transition to adulthood successfully
7415323 for example i envision translating certain aspects of our current site www teendiariesonline com such as the i want her job segment that introduces our readers to nontraditional career opportunities into live workshops and camp opportunities
7415324 its so important for teens to have a place where theyre encouraged to speak their minds and theyre not judged t e e n diaries does just that
7415325 t e e n diaries is beyond necessary today it is so easy for teens to not have a voice and this gives them an outlet to be heard it bridges the communication gap between parents and their children i will be looking to t e e n diaries to get insight on what my kids are thinking in the future

7415370 under section 4 of the employment act she should have gotten at least about 30 000 but what the hotel did was this it only paid her 5 000
7415371 the act clearly states that employers cannot contract out of the employment act this means say you are my employer and i your employee you just can not sign out of vacation pay or overtime pay if i am entitled to such
7415372 for example lets say she was making 150 00 per week her gratuities would have brought that up to 500 to 700 a week
7415373 even though the employees had signed releases we are of the view that they are not legal and binding since the law was breached as far as compensation is concerned
7415374 halloween is coming up and my kids want to be army men since we are not in the military i wanted to ask you all what you thought would be respectful vs disrespectful for costume purposes about the patches and accessories such as should they get the embroidered last name and arm flag and what about the rank patches would it be cute to make them something high ranking or better to just leave it off any tips about the boots they want to carry guns which is fine in the backyard but i am thinking that too many people would be offended by seeing children or anyone walking around the neighborhood with weapons especially dressed in combat attire
7415375 this would be a very bad move indeed dr shumack said
7415376 the college fears that appropriate people may not be given it inappropriate people may be given it and the side effects may not be managed appropriately

7415382 sometimes you have to make a last ditch effort and thats why i have this medal around my neck right now
7415383 i dont know what to say i ran the best i could
7415384 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
7415385 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
7415386 i dont use things as redemption especially when we come together as a relay were out there as one im not out there as an individual im out there with three other men that were going to run their hearts out
7415387 unfortunately my open race wasnt what i wanted but ive got to look past that i got a long career ahead of me
7415388 thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges

7415393 under all circumstances this information was not to reach the hands of a terrorist organization or an unauthorized state
7415394 we could have respected the treaty by avoiding their publication and putting them under lock and key
7415395 if they had kept the material in federal possession for years why not keep holding it
7415396 the newspapers know more about these things than i do
7415397 no answers to the really interesting questions in this case

7415404 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7415405 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7415406 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7415407 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7300 a year
7415408 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7415409 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7415410 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement
7415411 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement

7415422 studies show a lot of people have these episodes and dont even make it to the hospital
7415423 i would love to see all kids get an ekg if even one person could avoid what happened to me
7415424 there arent enough primary care providers in boston and potentially the state to do this
7415425 an ekg may identify more athletes with disease but it also produces many false positives that would create chaos in the system
7415426 the advocates for these things either arent aware of the number of kids participating in high school sports or dont consider the cost or the logistical problems
7415427 statistically when it comes to sudden death its young and black
7415428 the big issue now is can we make a three minute echo feasible enough to do on all kids
7415429 we would argue that if we can refine our protocol that if it can be done very quickly and at minimal cost its probably worth doing

7415457 the swim was never meant to be as big as it became we never expected it to get so huge
7415458 last year there were hundreds of people in the town on christmas morning for the swim and we the four organisers decided that it had become too big for us to organise
7415459 we all felt we did not have the time to give to this event as organising it and making sure all the proper health and safety issues are taken into account takes a lot of work so we decided to call it a day
7415460 but we are now confident that the swim will be back this year we have a meeting in the next couple of weeks with several large organisations such as rotary and marie curie and we are confident that one of these will as a properly organised committee take over the running of the event
7415461 all of these events have been down to the hard work of individuals or small groups and all of them have grown in popularity and as such the organisation and often the funding necessary to put these events on has become a massive strain for the organisers
7415462 there is no doubt that these events brought in hundreds of extra people to the town suffolk homes
7415463 this man is extremely ill and we like his family want to know how this happened and who assaulted him
7415464 we know there were numerous late night revellers on the high street at the time who would have seen a disturbance outside this convenience store we need them to contact us this mans family are completely and utterly distraught

7415510 i am feeling very positive particularly with the gold medal performances that have happened
7415511 people generally have been saying to me that they are motivated to go out on a bike this week and i imagine that youngsters will be enthused and engaged with what is happening at the olympics
7415512 there is a really good feel factor around the olympics and it is our role to help suffolk sport capitalise on that
7415513 i think the olympics has been very successful in pushing the sport forward and certainly with the next olympics being in london there is a real good feel factor about the sport in general
7415514 we expect a rise in the number of people participating in swimming clubs are hoping for a boost and a number of pools have been busier over the summer we are even seeing an increase in adult swimming lessons at the moment i think the health agenda has been on the radar for a while but the olympics has added to that
7415515 i think the olympics will raise the profile of cycling we have already noticed our membership numbers have gone up
7415516 it has been a really positive few weeks for british sports and we have seen numbers booming in our cyclo cross league
7415517 it is encouraging to see a boost in the number of youngsters as well at the mildenhall rally this weekend we are expecting a good response after victoria pendletons gold medal

7415525 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team

7415537 he has to show hes a regular guy and his story is closer to the american dream than his opponents hes a self made man against all odds and against all obstacles
7415538 we know obama is able to bring suburban young and minority voters

7415547 i have decided to raise no objections under australias foreign investment policy to chinalco acquiring a shareholding interest of up to 14 99 percent of rio tinto plc on the basis of chinalco making two undertakings
7415548 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7415549 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter

7415596 during this meeting stoiber endorsed russias goal of defeating the u s proposed anti missile defense system and elbowing its way into a joint
7415597 emerging from the meeting with putin stoiber told the media emphatically that only two solutions are possible on anti missile defense in europe the u s plan or the russian plan and that
7415598 the anti missile defense system would be placed under joint
7415599 the position of germany of its government in any case my bavarian governments and my partys position is entirely clear we are in favor of the second solution
7415600 apart from the missile defense issue stoiber called for the creation of a european union russia free trade zone apparently leaving out ukraine although the latter seeks an arrangement of this type with the eu
7415601 extreme forms of flattery he gave stoiber a long session in the kremlin detailed information about putins july 2 discussion with u s president george w bush at kennebunkport a parade of the kremlin guard cavalry company organized especially for stoiber an unprecedented favor and a private dinner for the stoibers at putins residence outside moscow
7415602 i dont think the public thought it would come to this
7415603 rarely have we had a clearer signal from a large majority of americans consistently over an extended period of time that we believe hes done it we dont care hes done it get off of it
7415604 there was not an expectation we might come to this
7415605 substantial and credible information that may constitute grounds for impeachment
7415606 we do know this there is no basis for impeachment
7415607 the irony of the thing is that there are very few people in the united states except deep clinton haters who want to remove the president from office for sexual perjury
7415608 and yet we are on an escalator and we are not sure how to get off the escalator

7415617 while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice
7415618 once an agency and organisation has discovered or suspects that a personal information security breach has occurred they should take immediate common sense steps to limit the breach
7415619 notification can be an important mitigation strategy that has the potential to benefit both the agency or organisation and the individuals affected by a personal information security breach the challenge is to determine when notification is appropriate while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice each incident needs to be considered on a case by case basis to determine whether breach notification is required

7415677 its all the same youve got to coach them all every years the same youve got to win you lose some veterans and youve got to replace them with some young guys
7415678 the biggest thing is it forces you to start all over and really start fine tuning and teaching those guys every little detail with veteran players you dont have to rep everything under the sun
7415679 they have been making a lot of plays and theyre learning the defense very well
7415680 obviously the coaches have confidence in what theyre doing since theyre putting them back there if the coaches have confidence i have confidence
7415681 im going to trust im coaching those boys the right way

7415683 i hope im not sticking my foot in my mouth but hes a pretty poised kid for never having played yet

7415685 you can just tell when you play the position that long youre very instinctive about it
7415686 niles coming over from wide receiver now hes got to learn all the fundamentals the basic backpedal mechanics how to explode out of your pedal as well as all those defenses all those adjustments at least with mario hes got an understanding of what it takes to play cornerback
7415687 he adds that level of experience so at least on one side of the field you know he knows what hes doing
7415688 now hes not always going to make the play but at least you know you dont have to panic about that side
7415689 hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background went to school on scholarships he and his wife had to figure out child care and how to start a college fund for their kids

7415692 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7415693 duff had become spade overcoming two intimidating handicaps the image of bogart and the power of the novel compared to bogarts dour and straitlaced spade duffs was a cutup a hard knuckled master of street level whimsy and sarcastic comeback his sense of burlesque was superb the adventures of sam spade was its own entity owing little to the forces that had created it

7415697 a true global citizen is today precisely the one who re discovers or returns to or identifies with some particular roots some specific substantial communal identity the global order is ultimately nothing but the very frame and container of this mixing and shifting multitude of particular identities

7415702 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7415703 the storm is actually weakening thats not to say were not going to have rain
7415704 were still expecting some flooding because of this weve got everything on standby hopefully it wont come to that
7415705 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7415706 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7415707 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7415708 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7415709 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7415710 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7415711 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7415712 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7415713 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7415714 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7415715 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7415716 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7415717 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7415718 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7415719 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role

7415724 the limo is for my birthday party if it it is ok with your dad you can come out and get in it and take a look around
7415725 i cant believe you did all of this its so cool
7415726 wow we can totally make faces at people and they cant see us
7415727 considering the number of kids we lost im a little shocked
7415728 i think thats the reason why were ranked high respect
7415729 respect to the program our tradition and where weve been its not based on what we have coming back
7415730 im a little shocked that we were ranked that high but im not shocked at where katy and carroll are ranked theyre good football teams
7415731 rankings are good for reading and speculation but itll all be decided on the football field
7415732 were a notoriously slow starting team but its not how you start but its how you finish
7415733 i think if cody can get the ball to a j well get the ball in the end zone
7415734 i have brought you t master it took quite a lot of searching on your galaxys non holographic communications network but no man is beyond the reach of a sith
7415735 we were doing this debate in a class recalled crawford
7415736 i was one of four people who was supposed to represent michael dukakis i kept researching and researching and at some point it dawned on me oops i think i might be a republican
7415737 i didnt really know him in high school said nelson
7415738 i just knew who he was rick stafford will be attending his ninth presidential convention the first coming in 1972 when he was motivated by his opposition to the war in vietnam to become a delegate
7415739 when you have been at as many conventions as i have said stafford
7415740 but they taught their children to think independently said vekich who will be an alternate in the delegation of
7415741 i just hope it doesnt turn out to feel like a waste of time the general mills vice president said
7415742 i think im destined to be a contrarian said crawford 37
7415743 maybe thats why ive always liked mccain thats his reputation too
7415744 id see somebody who was supporting fred thompson or rudy giuliani and id say congratulations looks like my guy lost and your guy has a good chance he recalled
7415745 i always believed that in my lifetime thered be a black man in this position crawford said
7415746 i just always hoped that it would have been a republican
7415747 i admire hillary clinton and i was a big fan of hers in the beginning said nelson 46
7415748 but in the end it came down to character hillarys a fighter and thats wonderful thats who she is but i look at how he works more in collaboration i truly believe thats what the world needs now
7415749 when he wrote about his experiences in hawaii as a black man it reminded me so much of my own experiences she said
7415750 most of those 29 will likely vote for clinton he predicted
7415751 i was an activist for clinton but as a superdelegate my position is a little more nuanced stafford said
7415752 history is full of courageous leaders who in their private lives were terrible and abusive spouses and parents depressives drunks bullies individuals have a way of partitioning their lives handling one set of duties commendably and another abysmally
7415753 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
7415754 prude how the sex obsessed culture hurts young women and america too
7415755 how can obama be blowing this we are giving him every advantage possible we even threw hillary clinton overboard because she was less liberal than him and yet the guy we pretended to like all these years is overtaking our anointed candidate how
7415756 were pretty much all best friends and we werent just creaming teams the way they would have been in developmental soccer where u12 gold players formerly performed were really learning the game
7415757 gives the boys new opportunities to dig deep and push themselves
7415758 i think its great for the kids theyve shown theyre old enough and mature enough to handle the level of competition and the demands of travel
7415759 the most exciting thing for me is watching these kids push each other to become better players
7415760 theyre becoming better not just physically but mentally i think if the kids were still playing in the developmental league theyd be bored
7415761 the boys are consistently challenged and we have a great group of parents
7415762 they really rose to the occasion they had been struggling to score goals and they figured ouf some things to solve the problem
7415763 there are a lot of things id like to work on
7415764 situational football red zone no turnovers getting the ball out of bounds and getting into the tempo after having not played for a year even just getting the formations out of my mouth as the game went on it got a lot smoother for me and those were just a few things that i learned
7415765 well one thing with me as a receiver i always feel like im open
7415766 so im never covered ever there are different things that go on you have a play that the quarterback has to do his progressions and all that stuff but i feel like i was getting open yeah
7415767 hey thats a brilliant choice and now kerrys my man
7415768 it seems like four months since i won a game
7415769 felix had strep throat and two days ago didnt look good at all
7415770 he was tough today he took a big step forward he pitched sick gave us six good innings after the sixth though he was done
7415771 second time it was a good pitch he was just swinging good today
7415772 i was playing third so adrian beltre could dh and rest his shoulder
7415773 i cant try to be beltre i can only be myself i try to be ready
7415774 i come to the park prepared to play every day i wake up at the same time i eat at the same time everything is the same whether i play or not
7415775 every time weve said dickey was going to stay in the bullpen something has happened to one of our starters and weve had to go back to him
7415776 could dickey start again this year yes could batista yes
7415777 i thought it was broken because i had the same sick feeling as i did in 2005 when i broke my hand
7415778 its a big relief not to have it broken weve got a month left to play and i want to stay part of it
7415779 i havent had a sore arm once all season and thats a huge thing for me if nothing else this season im proving i can pitch a full year without arm problems
7415780 this thursday night well have six guys no seven guys that wont be attending the game

7415789 ive been floating on a cloud the past year wanting this to happen for my dad
7415790 when i got the call about the dna the cloud disappeared from beneath me and i fell to the ground and crashed
7415791 i was actually keeping my hopes up i just thought the first one failed and theyd do another set do more testing and it would work out this time
7415792 in my mind i was hoping for a better result in my mind i was preparing to bring nellie home
7415793 im just trying to keep a good thought i hope this can lead us to the next step
7415794 concerned members stepped forward they decided enough is enough and came forward with the information that we required
7415795 i think people just have to come forward and talk to the rcmp
7415796 they have information people know who the perpetrators are and all they need to do is come forward and tell the rcmp
7415797 when i first read about this i couldnt believe it was legal
7415798 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
7415799 if a board of trustees authorizes a person employed as security personnel to carry a weapon the person must be a commissioned peace officer
7415800 it says thats the case if they are employed as a security personnel
7415801 these are not security personnel those are teachers who are just helping to make sure the school is a safer place
7415802 the legislature has empowered them to govern and set policies as they see fit
7415803 one of the reasons our nations k 12 schools are far safer than surrounding areas of society is because firearms are very tightly regulated on school property
7415804 it is a myth that gun free schools increase the dangers to our children
7415805 as i talk to you right now on my deck i can see the tower it is pretty near and dear to me
7415806 two years havent faded my desire to seek some closure to this
7415807 all tips are very actively pursued sometimes people find information that they might not think is pertinent it is better to give us that information and let us decide than to shrug it off
7415808 two years later i can tell you that this still hurts and there are people in this department for whom this is still an open wound
7415809 they miss her and they would like to see some resolution to this
7415810 hi don my son steve was murdered thursday his funeral is at
7415811 don steve didnt have his gun he always carries his gun when he comes to my house he has his gun on him under his shirt he doesnt go anywhere without his gun don he didnt have his gun in fact when the police were telling me about the shooting i asked them where steves gun was they said that they had not found his gun so i told them that the criminals have it later we found it at his home
7415812 i live in a nice neighborhood my wife and i go walking nearly every evening do you think i should take my gun with me
7415813 well thats a personal decision that you will have to make for yourself
7415814 prostitution related offences have always been very low priority that calls into question why we do this in the first place if theyre such low priority
7415815 unless the police are receiving complaints from the community theyre not going to act
7415816 there are too many deaths too many robberies too many rapes too many beatings which are a direct result of the law
7415817 that would be one significant factor why the numbers are down
7415818 there isnt that element that we say if its not bothering anyone we leave it alone
7415819 sex trade workers tend to recruit younger and younger individuals
7415820 were certainly on the fact that we could be dealing with children under 18 years of age out on the street
7415821 when youre on the street youre a nobody nobody cares about you
7415822 if you should be beaten up or robbed or raped and you go to the police its rather dicey whether they lay charges against the person or whether they think youre credible they may even end up charging you
7415823 the assumption may be that if you werent working as a street prostitute this wouldnt have happened to you
7415824 we are appalled by this cruel abduction of journalists and call for the immediate release of our colleagues who are being held captive because of their noble work for somali people
7415825 first all we had was the name of amanda nothing else
7415826 she was in the most dangerous place for journalists in the world and nothing happened to her
7415827 she said the only security i have is the shirt that i am wearing
7415828 she has to be on the frontlines and she has to be with the people to tell their story and the humanitarian side of everything was is huge for amanda to bring that to the light so that people can help
7415829 i heard a voice ordering them to turn the car in a different direction
7415830 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquiries but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7415831 wherever she is right now i know that shes keeping a positive attitude because shes an innately positive person
7415832 i dont want to use the word fearless but she is a courageous person of course theres apprehension and she did speak about that but she never really used the term fear
7415833 she said she was drawn to the passion of the people who were in these zones in other words if youre in a zone of conflict nothing is taken for granted and you live each moment like it was a lifetime of experience
7415834 she is an intelligent caring and adventurous professional who was well aware of the dangers of the regions she frequented
7415835 she was also aware that her audience was keenly interested in her world perspective and she worked bravely to bring them that perspective

7415890 we have no idea the mode of what he did with the cyanide or if he ingested it intentionally or not
7415891 cyanide has a long history of use as a murder weapon terrorist weapon and weapon of war as well as an agent of suicide and attempted genocide
7415892 the characteristics of cyanide are those of the ideal terrorist weapon
7415893 we dont see anything to make us believe that theres any terrorist involvement
7415894 he had no money whoever gave him the money for that hotel may have also given him the cyanide we need to find that person

7415917 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

7415943 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7415944 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations

7415985 there was something really jarring about a musical set in america in the thirties
7415986 shows like keating the musical and shane warne the musical are just fantastic
7415987 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time yet
7415988 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels

7416019 it could be a week or two it could be less the white house will look at our recommendations and they may have questions
7416020 a lot of people are flooded but the flood will subside
7416021 i feel like its gods work and he has blessed us
7416022 now we begin the prayer for thankfulness and continue to pray for those affected
7416023 but god let it go on then god spoke to fay and told her to move on we just have to remember to be patient
7416024 the storm was worse than the ones before but i never saw any rain like this
7416025 its not the work of god but the ruler of this world and thats sad
7416026 you see in the garden of eden god never planned for tornadoes or hurricanes i bet many of us prayed this week more than we have in a while you know why because we had no control
7416027 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7416028 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7416029 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7416030 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7416031 the communist aggressor has been hurled back from south korea
7416032 have plunged us into a war in korea without the consent of our citizens through their authorized representatives in the congress and have carried on that war without will to victory
7416033 he changed the whole tone young people across america responded to stevenson in 1952 and this has affected them ever since
7416034 this is the most difficult decision since ive been here
7416035 ive had more than one person come to me and say why dont you just give this guy life without parole surely the victims will be ok with that sort of suggesting you cant be gay and be for the death penalty
7416036 i cant speak about what it was in the past but its not that now
7416037 what appears to have happened with warren is that this tragedy has now made him one of theirs
7416038 im out here in a gay wasteland and heres a guy who was smart who had seen the world and also you know i was hurting and he was hurting and we were able to be there for each other
7416039 i think it makes people aware that the loss of a partner in a gay relationship is the same as the loss of a partner in a straight relationship
7416040 thats a side of my brother ive never seen warren with a wrench in his hands would be like me sitting at a sewing machine
7416041 to see him take off and go like hes gone its just unbelievable
7416042 warren are you keeping this because of robs memory or are you staying here because you want to stay here
7416043 thats when i started look at the deal a whole lot different
7416044 it makes me be more accepting of people for what they are and the way that they are i mean it just made me stop and think all the years i was prejudiced all the slang terms i used over the years loosely just like warren said its not just a physical thing its the companionship you look at how many people who go through life and never find true love
7416045 i dont feel real comfortable talking about it but unfortunately for our family it took this for us to acknowledge warrens lifestyle for us as a family to all sit down and talk about it
7416046 at some point im going to have to go through all this again
7416047 im not worried you know im lucky as hell when it comes to stuff like this
7416048 its kind of a surreal feeling when youre prepared for it to go one way and today its over its almost like christmas
7416049 i havent had time to emotionally process all this news yet
7416050 this confessed killer sits here now in front of us facing a sentence of life in prison without parole
7416051 i sit here with three life sentences the rest of my life without my partner robert king whiteside the memory of my discovering roberts body lying dead face down in a pool of blood which i will live with the rest of my life and a life forever changed emotionally financially and with a lost sense of security due to a cruelty and total disregard for human life
7416052 i thought if i did sell the property would i stay in the area or not thats become more of a valid question in the last couple of months because im becoming more and more ingrained now in the community and with the people that i know out here i mean this has become my home
7416053 its really sad that it took what happened with robert for that to happen
7416054 it may be that he was afraid of being of being world famous because we laid the groundwork and then he just kind of walked away from it
7416055 for the democrats this really hits on all cylinders for them
7416056 the worst of the housing crisis is going to come next year and it will call all of the financial regulation into deeper question
7416057 fed chairman bernanke is not going anywhere and barney frank is not going anywhere and whoever is treasury secretary is going to be sympathetic to start a reform movement
7416058 we thought itd be particularly timely for congress consumption right around the time they come back
7416059 a number of different luminaries in the financial services sector
7416060 this is how the political process works they dont react until its too late and then they overreact
7416061 it puts everybodys regulatory turf in play you take a couple of years and then maybe after emergency legislation in 2009 you can have serious discussion about broader regulatory reform in 2010 or 2011
7416062 lets get through this and wait until the dust settles
7416063 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses treating your neighbor as youd like to be treated
7416064 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7416065 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7416066 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7416067 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7416068 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave
7416069 would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose which along with a pair of jet black eyes was offered as proof of cherokee blood
7416070 the thought occurred to me maybe that would be a good slogan for her grandson
7416071 glenn miller tommy dorsey benny goodman harry james i dont think there was a one from that era that we didnt have at the blue moon
7416072 black slicked back hair and his perpetual wise guy grin
7416073 gramps is probably too busy telling one of his jokes or arguing with toot their version of the hawaiian word
7416074 toot notices but shes polite enough to bite her lip and offer dessert her instincts warn her against making a scene
7416075 every morning she woke up at five a m and changed from the frowsy muu muus sic she wore around the apartment into a tailored suit and high heeled pumps
7416076 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7416077 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world
7416078 she really put me straight she made a point of indicating that experience is equitable to going to college and she was right
7416079 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7416080 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7416081 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7416082 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7416083 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7416084 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7416085 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7416086 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7416087 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7416088 i used to think i dont know whos the supervisor here me or her
7416089 when stanley was still alive they would go on cruises around the islands and theyd do nothing but play bridge
7416090 they cut back on expensive medications their homes are too hot because they wont turn on air conditioning
7416091 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7416092 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7416093 i do a lot of things now being 87 that i wished i could do when i was a kid
7416094 i say its kind of a disease you get buying cars that you never expect to ride in just look at
7416095 he generally does not buy anything unless he feels that its a good bargain
7416096 he haggles hes very disappointed if they take his first offer
7416097 hed travel miles in the model t to collect 25 cents for insurance
7416098 i always had to park it on a hill because either the starter or the battery was dead
7416099 i favor ford because my first restaurant was right across the street from a ford factory
7416100 i always thought i had to drive a ford until the plant manager said truett we need to get you in a lincoln
7416101 you dont have to pay 30 000 to have a nice car to ride around in
7416102 its more comfortable looking at it than it is riding in it
7416103 its kind of hard to get it around the curb so we dont take it out too much
7416104 its custom made they say it will climb a tree but i havent tried it
7416105 my brother in law bought a new one when i was 13 years old
7416106 i said then i hope to be able to buy one someday myself
7416107 we will select the best players from these mini tournaments to represent the city in the coming regional meet iraa on february next year
7416108 d ont worry about your life what you will eat or about the body what you will wear can any of you add a cubit to his height by worrying if then youre not able to do even a little thing why worry about the rest
7416109 trust in the lord with all your heart and do not rely on your own understanding
7416110 think about him in all your ways and he will guide you on the right paths
7416111 but daniel works for a grocery wholesaler and the company let us have all of the damaged goods in this weeks shipment
7416112 i didnt know what to get you for your birthday so i bought you groceries i hope you dont mind
7416113 pastor my husband had a heart attack last night and we took him to the hospital but he was dead on arrival i cant believe it has happened but we need your help i know he was not a church member but we would like for you to preach his funeral
7416114 know i am at peace with complete certainty i believe dad is standing watch prepared to guide me into the light
7416115 i always do what nana franscesa my great grandmother taught me to do when grieving light candles say prayers cook a meal for friends buy some flowers if i can find them fresh set up an altar wish the person well on their way home
7416116 deborah i hope you get there with ease and peace im sorry your way out of this world was so rocky that you were not treated with the grace and graciousness that every human being deserves
7416117 im praying that franscesa or someone very like her is there to greet you with a meal some flowers and some sweetness on the other side
7416118 i realize im worth more than what i was doing to myself
7416119 i had a cluster of plantar warts treated by a dermatologist she used a liquid nitrogen spray which was excruciatingly painful my kidney stone was less painful the warts persisted even after this treatment
7416120 then i treated them with warm water soaks and duct tape which i kept on all day the warts went away and stayed away after about six weeks of treatment
7416121 i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
7416122 i have tried to get into modeling but i have been turned away as im apparently too big to be a regular model
7416123 i want to show people that you dont have to be a size zero to be beautiful
7416124 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7416125 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7416126 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7416127 if i had a quarter for every time i said
7416128 if i had a quarter for every time i said
7416129 the fact that you have to look at your cell phone even for that one second is dangerous
7416130 you see people texting and walking all the time thats all people are doing
7416131 clearly if youre engaged in texting that requires concentration its very difficult to do another task especially walking in a big city
7416132 with time were knocking out our visual and audio cues that are grounding us in our environment
7416133 office lady to be reckoned with the same could be said about misaki kicking some werewolf butt
7416134 unfortunately weve been operating in a system of crisis management and wed like to go to one of strategic planning
7416135 new jersey commission on rationalizing health care resources final report
7416136 theres a lot of meat left in the reinhardt commission report that hasnt been acted upon
7416137 its enough money to stay alive but not enough money to grow
7416138 it sounds like in my opinion were going to be limping along with this charity care problem and no health care reform for a number of years
7416139 its really not that difficult its just a matter of taking your time
7416140 its been my life dream to get my home off the road
7416141 to see something so large and heavy being moved so delicately is unbelievable these guys are like surgeons theyre amazing
7416142 ive told everyone theres one thing i want to do before i die
7416143 theres a lotta biz buzz back in hollyweird about you guys
7416144 no need to actually stop and think before the joke hits
7416145 just gross em out and make sure somebody drops trou give us crude sexual allusions and raw references to genitalia oh and we need an obnoxious drunken will ferrell like lummox at center stage thats comedy boys thats what makes a real knee slapper
7416146 lady do you have any idea how many kids we have in here every day buying games do you think we have the time to look at each and every purchase
7416147 any failure rate is problematic but the failure rate were seeing is downright pathetic
7416148 similar to age restrictions on alcohol tobacco pornography and other products that are potentially harmful to children parents deserve a reasonable expectation that age restrictions for adult entertainment products will be enforced at the retail level
7416149 it is outrageous that retailers are not exercising greater responsibility and even more absurd that there are no meaningful consequences for those retailers who ignore their industrys own age restriction policies
7416150 countless independent studies confirm that repeated exposure to graphic sexual violent and profanity laced video games has a harmful and long term effect on children
7416151 it is high time for retailers to follow the video game industry guidelines and check ids so that children will not be able to purchase m rated video games
7416152 perhaps the retailers felt the pressure was off after the ftcs report was published but frankly either rate of failure is wholly unacceptable
7416153 we encourage concerned citizens to contact their congressional representatives to ensure that the video game industry will become more responsible
7416154 americas children need to be protected from harmful exposure to these products and parents should be able to rely on the industrys promises
7416155 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
7416156 but god proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
7416157 for by grace you are saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is gods gift not from works so that no one can boast
7416158 if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
7416159 what we are trying to do is make it possible for the army to be a better neighbor while carrying theyre out the training
7416160 what were trying to do is learn more about how weather affects received noise level
7416161 we have high quality microphones and digital recorders stationed at a total of 27 stations in the field
7416162 normally on a bright sunny days the noise level is fairly low almost unnoticeable
7416163 and on days when there is a low ceiling or a weather front moving in those tend to be more problematic
7416164 newbery schanbacher an baseball betting industry veteran was our top choice for vice president of sales and marketing
7416165 and we recruited heavily for this position basically we wanted someone with a lot of experience and sales experience
7416166 dont forget to talk about vacation time which is an essential component of any baseball betting industry interview
7416167 if you want to make a big paycheck realize that youll have a more stressful life as a result make sure that you have time to relax each year be it one long vacation or shorter breaks throughout the year
7416168 ive seen many hot shots try to hit home runs with little experience without learning to simply get base hits and doubles first success comes with small steps and knowledge not one great play no matter how memorable
7416169 having you game together before you go for an interview is absolutely key to making it out in one piece if your top choice is company a do some practice interviews at companies b and c before attempting your top job choice
7416170 and then was promoted to senior sales associate i worked this position for another year before moving to the executive marketing position i currently hold
7416171 it really allows our patients to get quality care at home
7416172 we want to be able to take care of these people from the time they are diagnosed through treatment and after treatment
7416173 it has been our pleasure to serve the reynoldsburg community for the past five years
7416174 the new location better positions us for greater opportunities for ministry
7416175 our goal is to be a one source location with christian resources for churches and individuals as we strive to fulfill our vision of providing biblical solutions for life
7416176 as the day of the long awaited opening ceremony arrives chinas economy is indeed slowing a slowdown in export growth is rippling across the economy new orders at factories have declined and the countrys property market has seen a sharp drop in transaction volumes
7416177 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
7416178 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
7416179 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
7416180 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china
7416181 business books on china are published so frequently these days it seems there is a secret factory churning them out

7416190 two fertilized eggs are implanted in the uterine wall at the same time when two eggs are independently fertilized by two different sperm cells dz twins result the two eggs or ova form two zygotes hence the terms dizygotic and biovular

7416198 as long as russia can be said to be abiding by the terms of the cease fire in georgia
7416199 there is an issue but i dont think its so strong to prevent the waiver from passing as long as russian behavior is what it has been agreed to on georgia

7416288 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain

7416294 that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7416295 i expected to finish well because i was confident during the climb i was also fortunate not to fall or injure myself my plan was to reach the peak as fast as i could and to take it slow in the descent
7416296 had there been a runner close to me in the descent i may have gone a minute or two faster i had a good lead so i ran more cautiously
7416297 i am happy though as this is my first ever race here and i did not expect to win anything

7416311 behind all of the pomp and glitter an untold number of chinese citizens are now languishing in labour camps prisons or simply missing as a result of these games
7416312 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7416313 the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation

7416357 this isnt a new phenomenon over the last 20 years we have had to turn over some rosters weve had some very good players leave so the system has to stay the same the key is to have the minor league and scouting departments contribute players who can step in and replace them

7416480 since hercules is the greek ideal for strength and courage and was said to have founded the olympic games to honour zeus phelpsean was a no brainer
7416481 do i think phelpsean com will fetch 1 million i think its worth far more than 1 million to someone out there
7416482 as far as the url in question it is not in violation of our policies however it is certainly a very steep price for someone to potentially pay
7416483 these were obtained by a source close to the players while they were in vegas practising
7416484 this vital field of action for the church requires a radical change of mentality an authentic new awakening of conscience in everyone new methods are needed as are new expressions and new courage

7416489 i came here the day after finishing the martin scorsese
7416490 i just had the flight time between the two filming schedules essentially thats how its working out its pretty well back to back right now
7416491 which is great because the variety of work i can choose to do now is stupendous i can choose to do a film like
7416492 i can also really allow myself to push the parameters of recklessness in my work i dont mean in my discipline but i do mean in the performance although im absolutely word perfect on the text i did allow myself to be a lot looser and more reckless in
7416493 and i can also choose to play a silly little role like in
7416494 for the most part if you look at my cv
7416495 very often im either the moral center of the film or the political center of the film but to be part of the comedic half of the film as in
7416496 so those four films in philadelphia pretty well represent what im allowed to do now what i allow myself to do and the great position i find myself in which is having these wonderful choices so i say yes i can do that for mike myers that would be wonderful as well as of course doing this immensely committed and dedicated role with penelope in elegy

7416501 so i had to be free of any judgment of him positive or negative and as i say to remove as many layers as possible through which to filter him

7416714 go up the bridge stay down dont go up the second bridge
7416715 its so well arranged that you cannot divide it up
7416716 the real haves are they who can acquire freedom self confidence and even riches without depriving others of them they acquire all of these by developing and applying their potentialities on the other hand the real have nots are they who cannot have aught except by depriving others of it they can feel free only by diminishing the freedom of others self confident by spreading fear and dependence among others and rich by making others poor
7416717 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god if this is part of how you were raised its possible that you believe loving money and wealth is greedy
7416718 i saw you on tv last night debating with barack obama
7416719 he says im losing my memory and that i wont be able to remember the names of foreign leaders if im elected but im going to prove him wrong
7416720 johnny needs to learn the power of arbitrary authority that defies explanation how else will he be able to cope with dmv later in life
7416721 i have the same answer you gave your son it just is im thinking maybe its because a baseball cap is so casual and dinner is supposed to be a more formal affair or maybe because a cap casts a shadow on your face so its harder for you to have meaningful conversations while wearing one at the one place families are supposed to talk not sure but we use the same rule that being said a cubs hat should be allowed everywhere it should be a law
7416722 on your hat question removing the hat has long been a show of respect have you noticed that at the end of a round on the pga golfers remove their hats as they shake hands with their playing partners people used to remove their hats when going indoors or when in the presence of a lady or when our national flag passed by to remove the hat at dinner shows respect for ones dinner partners the family it shows respect for the people who made the meal if grace is said it shows respect for ones god in school removing the hat respects the teacher and the educational process which should in my opinion be treated as if kids take it seriously by implication to not remove the hat is to show that respect is not needed in the situation in question call me old fashioned but i think there are too few things these days that are treated with the respect that a civilized society should give them just my take on it
7416723 as far as school goes hats were banned about 10 years ago in most areas b c of gang markings
7416724 los consumidores argentinos son un poco m s sofisticados y el modelo de farmacias baratas que propon a simi s lo funcion bien en pocas de crisis pero cuando la situaci n mejor un poco los clientes se fueron hacia otro tipo de propuestas
7416725 la argentina es un pa s hermoso para pasear pero no para hacer negocios hay muchas regulaciones que frenaron nuestro crecimiento y por esa raz n decidimos concentrar todos los esfuerzos en el mercado chileno donde nos est yendo muy bien
7416726 ven amos perdiendo bastante plata y con el cierre de las farmacias quisimos dejar de perder
7416727 las regulaciones que existen en buenos aires y en otras provincias nos obligaron a reformular nuestro negocio en la argentina y para poder crecer en estos distritos tuvimos que lanzar un sistema de franquicias ya que por ley estamos obligados a que cada local pertenezca a una sociedad de comandita simple en la que participe como accionista un farmac utico
7416728 hoy tenemos 55 sucursales en la argentina y esperamos sumar otras nueve o diez antes de fines de a o al apuntar b sicamente al interior del pa s entre las provincias en las que queremos abrir figuran chubut corrientes r o negro san juan y jujuy
7416729 do not believe that post invasion intelligence invalidates our justification for using military force against saddams iraq the truth is the exact opposite
7416730 if we discover a desire within us that nothing in this world can satisfy also we should begin to wonder if perhaps we were created for another world
7416731 deep down inside you long for a cold hearted republican to lower taxes brutalize criminals and rule you like a king
7416732 the nine most terrifying words in the english language are im from the government and im here to help
7416733 after you vote for yourself will you turn to the ls on the ballot and vote for me
7416734 when i got the phone call from pat waak the state dem partys chair to tell me id been selected i started crying
7416735 i wouldnt go to the convention if they gave me a 50 check
7416736 now your room better be clean when i get home
7416737 it was waking up this friday and being asked to speak to the national convention of stonewall democrats 372 gay lesbian bisexual and transgendered delegates the largest number ever
7416738 i have a vote now before i would have been a lump in a chair
7416739 obama hasnt yet talked to me vice presidential nominee joe biden talks to me all time he has been an active proponent of womens issues but hes not the presidential candidate
7416740 we have 19 hard fast delegates for clinton and at least half are waiting to hear the message from obama but we will come together i look at it this way in 2000 we had an election stolen from us and in 2008 i am not going to give it away
7416741 my friends have told me the whole country in china is excited about the olympics and i really share the program with my host family
7416742 i brought him because hes at that age when hes starting to ask questions i thought i would at least allow him to see this process in action to see and hear what people had to say
7416743 i want him to hear opinions to see how people voice themselves
7416744 i want him to see what is happening to actually be a part of it in school he wont see or be taught any of this he needs to know what his country is about
7416745 it was something i definitely wanted to a part of
7416746 it was just a fantastic thing to see humans of every age and race come together
7416747 that never happens back home tomorrow they may pass each other on the street and they wont know each other but for this one day everyone had one shared purpose
7416748 it was the voices we heard it was powerful and so moving i will never forget it
7416749 if you think those guys have chemistry i think we have chemistry
7416750 yo nunca supe que me quitaban la concesi n porque carrefour hab a decidido incursionar de manera directa en el mercado aunque esto es apenas l gico si se tiene en cuenta que casi todos los supermercados tienen su propia cadena de droguer as hubiera sido interesante saber que buscaban un aliado para presentarles mi propuesta o por lo menos enterarme que ya lo ten an y por eso estaban sacando a fava de los supermercados
7416751 las boticas no son un desplante impulsivo y caprichoso est n perfectamente previstas tanto en la ley de medicamentos como en la estrategia de suministro se han insertado dentro de una estrategia de seguridad del acceso
7416752 las personas obtienen all un 85 de descuento del precio de los medicamentos esenciales y as se refuerza el programa de correspondiente a dichos medicamentos est n especialmente dirigidas a los sitios de dif cil acceso y donde habitan grupos econ micos menos privilegiados para garantizarles a ellos un suministro de calidad estas boticas no son improvisadas tienen su farmac utico un respaldo t cnico adecuado tienen una supervisi n adecuada desde el punto de vista profesional est n dispuestas como garant a y seguridad para que muchos venezolanos tengan acceso a medicamentos
7416753 representan una alternativa suplementaria o complementaria de los mecanismos que tiene el estado en ning n momento colidan ni entorpecen el sano y profesional ejercicio de las farmacias privadas
7416754 porque son comercializados en venezuela por muchas casas y sus reservas les han permitido garantizar al mercado farmac utico venezolano el abastecimiento por eso los medicamentos de consumo masivo en su mayor a gen ricos no han fallado
7416755 por eso en este momento no contamos con un desabastecimiento que podr amos catalogar de preocupante
7416756 en estos momentos se est n realizando compras de emergencia para garantizar que estos pacientes realmente tengan sus equipos sus insumos y sus medicamentos para realizar un proceso tan delicado como lo es la di lisis
7416757 la situaci n ha llevado a muchos sectores a reconsiderar su posici n estrat gica en el mbito de la salud
7416758 estos abarcan una gran gama de productos que resuelven la mayor a de los problemas terap uticos de las enfermedades m s importantes en lo que llamamos los perfiles de morbilidad y mortalidad de la poblaci n venezolana
7416759 nosotros necesitamos quebrar monopolios eso no es un problema s lo de venezuela sino del mundo estamos demasiado restringido a algunas casas comerciales que jugaban por no decir manipulaban demasiado en el mercado hoy la india china pakist n se han convertido en mercados emergentes poderos simos del sector farmac utico de hecho la mayor a de los grandes laboratorios del mundo est n adquiriendo materias primas de estos pa ses y nosotros no nos vamos a rezagar en eso
7416760 los puede utilizar el rico y el pobre en las mismas condiciones de seguridad y de la calidad porque el estado venezolano tiene en estos momentos los mecanismos de regulaci n en materia de salud que nos permiten decir eso nuestros mecanismos siguen perfeccion ndose el instituto nacional de higiene vigila mucho los aspectos t cnicos y los legales reposan en la direcci n de drogas y cosm ticos del ministerio
7416761 est previsto en la ley por la v a de la emergencia y como productos de servicio
7416762 estamos garantizando adem s ampliando las posibilidades de oferta farmac utica en venezuela esa es una competencia sana antimonop lica y antioligop lica
7416763 el estado venezolano siempre hab a movilizado m s o menos el 2 o 3 en t rminos financieros en el sector farmac utico en este momento maneja entre el 30 y el 35 aspiramos al 50 del total del dinero que se mueve en el sector
7416764 el estado en su conjunto est invirtiendo m s de 600 millardos en medicamentos pero esto es ineficiente porque es muy dispersa en este momento estamos redise ando las bases para esto se debe aumentar la eficiencia y debe aumentar la eficacia
7416765 es m gico es muy m gico uno no lo vive no lo siente hasta que no est aqu le doy gracias a el compositor colombiano est fano asegur el viernes que

7416775 every filipino aspires to have a piece of land where they can build their dreams this aspiration is sacred to us and we are therefore fast tracking the processing of land patents in all parts of the country
7416776 we are likewise working for the speedier resolution of land cases in the country to unlock the potential of land as a dynamo of national development
7416777 many developing green applications for industrial gases will show the greatest growth first
7416778 for example in the u s the requirement to switch to low sulfur diesel fuel will boost the demand for hydrogen
7416779 has given us a problem in the last six to eight months
7416780 i am hoping that hydrogen will come down as capacity increases and there are no more spikes in our fuel charges such as oil natural gas or diesel
7416781 as long as capacity is online too i think hydrogen will level off
7416782 air liquides pipeline network will provide conocophillips with hydrogen needed to produce new ultra low sulfur diesel fuel the remaining hydrogen from the new smr will meet the increasing needs of air liquide hydrogen network customers especially existing and new petrochemical customers along the companys gulf coast pipeline system
7416783 over the next year or so i dont expect any significant supply problems
7416784 the board of directors of boc intends to recommend boc shareholders to accept the offer
7416785 esta invitaci n nos llena de orgullo y satisfacci n por el hecho de que el equipo de campa a del candidato barak obama nos tome en cuenta para participar en la convenci n dem crata que es una de las actividades m s importantes para los inicios de campa a presidencial en estados unidos
7416786 es un verdadero honor dado el nivel tanto de los oradores como de los invitados
7416787 el arte de golpear con los pies y las manos
7416788 lo primero que pide un inversionista es la estabilidad macroecon mica que haya una tasa de cambio que refleje la realidad del mercado y una parte muy importante es la seguridad jur dica y ciudadana
7416789 debemos siempre cuidarnos de que esa imagen no se vaya al exterior y afecte las gestiones que se hacen para promover la inversi n
7416790 aunque la mayor a de los problemas est n concentrados en el sector el ctrico en el que la rd tiene una muy particular historia de subsidios y distorsiones ello tambi n detiene a los inversionistas en otros sectores
7416791 poner en orden el sector el ctrico es una prioridad para restaurar la confianza entre los inversionistas
7416792 una de las debilidades importantes que tenemos en el clima de inversi n es que todav a existen ciertos grados de discrecionalidad en la aplicaci n de las leyes y eso naturalmente crea preocupaci n en el inversionista especial el extranjero que est acostumbrado a realizar sus transacciones en un marco de mucha seguridad jur dica
7416793 esto ocurre sobre todo por la falta de control en el sector que todo el que quiere hacer de vendedor con una simple tarjeta lo hace pero eso se puede corregir con una ley que regule a los vendedores
7416794 en el turismo hay garant as plenas para la inversi n y es el sector de mayor inversi n en el pa s que ha demostrado un crecimiento sostenibilidad y potencialidad de desarrollo tanto en nuevos hoteles como ofertas complementarias

7416817 my entire take on rock music has been tweaked after this film music was something i had put aside to make movies now i want to pursue music keenly
7416818 i dont rule that out if ever there was a desire in me to be part of a music band its now i wouldnt like to ignore this desire in me now because two years from now ill regret it
7416819 lo que decimos es que debe respetarse el plazo de cinco a os establecido por los legisladores

7416821 we paint what we know especially issues that affect us as a person in the community
7416822 people are free to interpret the pieces in whatever way they want it is up to the individual
7416823 the idea is about being far from home being away from their families
7416824 each idea has to rely on another to work that is the integral story
7416825 compromise plays a large part in our relationships and our community
7416826 did you know that one contestant actually got us all worked up when we found out that he was cutting up his brothers stamp collection for his work it was only after he assured us that his brother had given him his consent that we all heaved a sigh of relief
7416827 when we mooted the idea to the top management they had no idea what shoe customisation was all about and we had to explain everything in detail to them still we are glad that so many young artists came forward to take part
7416828 the canvas material was an ideal base for painting and furthermore pallas was celebrating its 50th anniversary which was in line with our 51st merdeka day celebration
7416829 if you notice young people are very creative and they love to share ideas providing an avenue for them to express themselves will eventually train them to be good entrepreneurs in the future due to the fact that they are able to experience how to research organise adapt and interact with different levels of people from a young age
7416830 shit somebody had fun in the surveys amp polls section
7416831 say dont you remember they called me al it was al all the time
7416832 its something i have been doing here lately and i cant get out of it i have just hit a little bump in the road and ill be out of it here shortly
7416833 you have to put somebody in that role he said
7416834 i feel this is amitabhs best performance he was the obvious choice for the role
7416835 amitabh suited the role of the ageing theatre actor perfectly i dont think anyone would have fitted the bill so well he is so eccentric performs so brilliantly and the way he speaks english is so impeccable and clear i feel he is the crowning glory of the film
7416836 rituparno ghosh creates magic out of relationship based cinema i dont think anyone would have treated the script the way he has done it
7416837 this film is in english and anyone who understands the language can enjoy it it imparts undertones of various messages and talks in particular of the conflict between theatre and cinema
7416838 i love watching a film like om shanti om but i know there are better people who are making such masala and romantic films now more intelligent and meaningful stories need to be told even mithya was such a film
7416839 the last lear is a niche film and so it was required to be shown internationally before being brought it to india it has already travelled to film festivals in toronto rome and london
7416840 when we thought of releasing the film around the summer vacations this year the ipl indian premier league matches were on and there were also a lot of big films packed till now we wanted to release it at a decent time when there wont be many commercial films to compete with

7416930 the ultimate land use study tour is the fastest and best way i know to see this up close and ask your own questions directly of farmers local government leaders and developers
7416931 the goal of the tour is to increase awareness knowledge and understanding of alternative land use implementation tools and expand leadership to consider pursuing some of these techniques here in wisconsin
7416932 these communities have figured out how to develop win win solutions that dont pit farmers and folks who want to preserve the land against developers
7416933 the ultimate land use study tour really shows how communities can protect farmland and their local agriculture infrastructure by using either purchase or transfer of development rights programs as tools to help implement their land use plans it was interesting to see and hear how farms could sell their development rights through a voluntary program
7416934 many farms then use proceeds from the sale of their development rights to reinvest in their operation often through installment purchase agreements that help reduce their tax liability as well farmers in those areas know they can plan for the future without fear of urban or suburban development popping up next door
7416935 these innovative tools will not work without first having a quality comprehensive plan

7416941 in the student world of that era groups reflecting mainstream america held the allegiance of few as a result we ypsls although earnestly regarding ourselves not only as socialists but even as marxists of a sort and thus to the left of 99 percent of americans spent the largest portion of our energies battling student groups even farther to our left sometimes this allowed us to capture the ostensible middle ground
7416942 in the early 1960s we were on the losing side in what proved a harbinger of the increasing radicalization of student activism throughout the decade the left wing soon took command of ypsl and the organization flew apart in an explosion of new factions each more radical than the last by 1965 most had found their way to more fertile fields in the emergent new left ironically they also thereby cleared a path for our rump of right wingers to re create the ypsl according to our own lights

7417010 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
7417011 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
7417012 i dont think you would find anybody in the who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
7417013 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
7417014 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist

7417032 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7417033 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7417034 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad

7417042 the reality is it is very difficult to implement and the state needs to show leadership so the towns have some short term incentives for regionalizing

7417052 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression

7417058 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station
7417059 i know this is a huge change for titchwell and for the very many people who share our deep love for the reserve but the need to go ahead with this scheme was clear
7417060 we faced a stark choice between sacrificing the brackish marsh or losing the whole site to the sea
7417061 in drawing up these changes we have listened hard to local people and to visitors as a result the new look site will keep and improve on all the things that make titchwell special for them
7417062 the markets reaction is muted because the proposed measure would be designed only for aged people
7417063 am i giving an accurate fair and orthodox picture of jesus the man and am i giving an accurate fair and orthodox interpretation of what he is saying alternatively am i imposing my pet theories am i following a theological agenda am i projecting my own thoughts and feelings am i telling you what i think jesus ought to have said or what i think he meant to say am i concentrating on my own academic and religious credentials so that i am i too busy trying to project myself that jesus cant be seen properly at all

7417073 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7417074 the clinton people here theyve said they wanted catharsis they wanted that roll call but they may not get it
7417075 they dont want to be blamed for any trouble at this convention
7417076 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7417077 typically presidential candidates have gotten a bump in the polls after naming their vice presidential running mate
7417078 obama apparently received no immediate benefit in the polls from naming biden as gallup poll daily tracking interviews conducted during the day on saturday still showed obama and mccain closely matched in voter preferences for president
7417079 polling yesterday found that 39 believe obama made the right choice while 25 disagreed

7417083 aggressive management of this infectious disease is feasible and can prevent high mortality rates and further transmission of drug resistant strains of tb

7417103 this places considerable doubt on the version of mr bird
7417104 the accused person is actively trying to deceive police by inferring other people are involved in the matter and not being entirely truthful
7417105 the one point that i do agree with the learned sergeant is that facts before your honour are circumstantial
7417106 there are significant factual disputes in relation to the matter
7417107 if there is any breach of the bail conditions mr bird can be arrested for that i note that this can be a long procedure and with any breach of bail he would spend a long time in custody
7417108 these laws will give the commonwealth government power to suspend welfare payments if people dont have their children enrolled and regularly attending school

7417113 now that i look back at the 04 experience it was a blessing to myself
7417114 lebron dwyane and also carlos boozer we were at americas lowest point in 04 and now were sitting here because we did a hell of a job putting american basketball back where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7417115 for one moment if we had gone the other way and gotten selfish we wouldnt be sitting with gold medals around our necks
7417116 after 2004 dwyane carmelo and i touched base with each other and said we wanted to make a commitment to be part of usa basketball and try to accomplish something that wed never done before and thats to win a gold medal
7417117 once we came together and said we want to do it we put in our time put in our hearts and we gave up our summers to sacrifice and play the game of basketball which we love to do
7417118 i think they took this tournament very seriously their guys were hungry and wanted to get back to the top thats what theyve done they were able to get back on top and show they should be in first place but they had to work for it
7417119 i meant a six year commitment seriously i felt everything we had done with the infrastructure was great but to really lift the bar and go forward we had to finish and go win
7417120 were going to celebrate now and talk about the future and the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be a part of what we do going forward
7417121 its gonna be tough to put a team like this back together but after the way we told this story how we represented ourselves and our country and enjoyed this experience hopefully everybody will want to do it
7417122 there were young guys in vegas who helped us prepare who have all the talent all they have to do now is grow and most important grow together

7417130 at the present time we are focusing our efforts on defending our client la bamba and mr caro with regard to the allegations involving inaccurate ctrs
7417131 the policy of la bamba since 2004 has been not to cash medicare checks and the company wholly denies that they knowingly engaged in any cashing of fraudulent medicare checks
7417132 develop implement and maintain an effective anti money laundering program reasonably designed to prevent the money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering
7417133 the implication of that statement in the indictment is that even if la bamba didnt know it was laundering money it should have known or at least suspected
7417134 it suggests the firm may not have done enough to detect suspicious activities indicative of money laundering

7417189 they did sg 1 and atlantis simultaneously for three years thats 40 hours of television each year and he wasnt eager to going back to that knowing that mgm wanted to do more movies for sg 1 either universe would have to wait until atlantis was done or atlantis would have to be done right now

7417260 we welcome the fact that two well established and well consolidated companies have agreed to work together and focus on our respective core businesses at a challenging time for the market with the sale of the residential properties to essex we will be able to focus even more on the development and sale of property and will not need to invest resources in letting and administration of the properties from a financial as well as from a market perspective the agreement with essex represents a good solution for sj ls which will release resources for the further development of our activities within the project development area both in denmark and abroad
7417261 essex already owns approx 5 000 residential units and the purchase of the sj ls portfolio will provide us with an attractive portfolio in greater copenhagen the rental market has seen highly positive developments in recent years in contrast to the more troubled owner occupied market under the current market conditions we wish to focus on investment in and rental of properties the sale of our construction site in restad syd to sj ls is therefore a logical consequence of our focus on investments in late stage projects it is very pleasant with a positive agreement between two strong companies in the market an agreement we are convinced will be for the benefit of both companies in future
7417262 dalam pikiranku tergambar beberapa dampak dari tulisanmu ini jika ia jadi dimuat
7417263 pertama artikel yang ditulis si fulan itu sangatlah tajam menusuk hati kaum muslimin sementara konsumen pembaca harian al ahraam itu sendiri relatif sedikit dibanding jumlah penduduk mesir secara keseluruhan dan rata rata mereka tidak membacanya dengan serius
7417264 jika kita menurunkan bantahan terhadap artikel tersebut maka akan timbul beberapa titik rawan diantaranya justru akan mengekspos artikel tersebut dan memancing keingintahuan bagi mereka yang belum membacanya sementara yang sudah membaca akan kembali terpancing untuk membaca dengan serius dengan demikian tanpa sadar kita telah memicu perhatian masyarakat kepada sesuatu yang buruk yang bisa saja mendatangkan mudharat bagi orang orang yang berjiwa lemah kalau artikel si fulan itu kita diamkan saja insya allah ia akan tenggelam dengan sendirinya
7417265 akhi bantahan adalah salah satu bentuk tantangan yang akan memancing sikap keras kepada bagi yang dibantah dan sekalipun ia menyadari bahwa ia salah tapi bantahan itu akan membuatnya bersikukuh pada kesalahannya ketahuilah akhi si fulan itu telah terpengaruh oleh sebuah lingkungan yang membuatnya berpikir seperti itu dan aku melihat tujuannya menulis artikel itu bukanlah untuk mengungkapkan apa yang menjadi keyakinannya melainkan sekedar mencari perhatian dengan cara menghalalkan segala cara
7417266 akhi jika sampai si fulan bersikukuh dalam kesalahan itu akibat bantahan yang kita sampaikan maka secara tidak langsung kita telah menghalangi pintu taubat baginya si fulan itu masih muda membukakan pintu kebenaran baginya jauh lebih baik daripada melemparkannya jauh jauh dari kebenaran yang sebenarnya menjadi hak dia justru kewajiban kitalah untuk membantunya meraih kebenaran itu aku tidak ingin emosi yang bermain dalam dada kita membuat seseorang terhalang dari hidayah allah begitulah pemikiranku bagaimana menurutmu akhi

7417269 bu kang endi tetangga kita yang sedang di rawat di rumah sakit itu kondisinya semakin memburuk bapak tidak sanggup melihat penderitaannya sepertinya kita harus bantu dia dan keluarganya tiga hari lalu kebetulan bapak sedang di sana seorang suster memberitahukan bahwa kang endi harus dioperasi segera keluarganya belum berani menyatakan iya sebab biaya operasi itu hampir rp 50 juta
7417270 kalau ibu berkenan bagaimana bila dana tabungan haji kita diberikan saja kepada mereka semua untuk biaya operasi
7417271 diberikan waduh pak hampir dua puluh tahun kita nabung dengan susah payah agar cita cita berhaji dapat diwujudkan masa bisa pupus seketika dengan membantu orang lain yang bukan saudara kita
7417272 bu banyak orang yang berhaji belum tentu mabrur di sisi allah mungkin ini adalah jalan buat kita untuk meraih keridhaan allah swt biarkan kita hanya berhaji di pekarangan rumah kita sendiri tidak perlu ke baitullah bapak yakin bila kita menolong saudara kita insya allah kita akan ditolong juga oleh dia yang maha kuasa
7417273 doakan ya agar operasi berjalan lancar dan pak endi semoga lekas sembuh kalau boleh tahu darimana dana operasi ini didapat
7417274 ada seorang tetangga kami bernama pak asep yang membantu alhamdulillah dananya bisa didapat dok
7417275 memangnya beliau usaha apa kok mau membantu dana hingga sebesar itu
7417276 dia hanya punya usaha toko kecil di dekat rumah kami saya saja sempat bingung saat dia dan istrinya memberikan bantuan sebesar itu

7417284 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7417285 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7417286 the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middle part of this year
7417287 one of the things well be experiencing later this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading to economic weakness
7417288 when you can get an adverse feedback loop that argues that what you need to do is act more aggressively
7417289 we will have to see where it will go it is too early to give a comment on that
7417290 our significant experience with coal mining in russia leaves us well positioned to make the most of our acquisition of pbs ensuring its continued growth by providing additional management and operational expertise
7417291 i think traders in asia are now feeling a bottom to the market after prices fell over 6 on friday so some of them may be seeing a buying opportunity at these price levels
7417292 lingering concerns about russia and georgia are also giving some support to prices
7417293 r eason is constantly evolving in history towards an absolute goal
7417294 a commodity is in the first place an object outside of us a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another the nature of such wants whether for instance they spring from the stomach or from fancy makes no difference neither are we here concerned to know how the object satisfies these wants whether directly as means of subsistence or indirectly as means of production
7417295 e very useful thing as iron paper amp c may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and quantity
7417296 the utility of a thing makes it a use value but this utility is not a thing of air being limited by the physical properties of the commodity it has no existence apart from that commodity a commodity such as iron corn or a diamond is therefore so far as it is a material thing a use value something useful this property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities use values become a reality only by use or consumption they also constitute the substance of all wealth whatever may be the social form of that wealth
7417297 u se values become a reality only by use or consumption
7417298 exchange value appears to be something accidental and purely relative and consequently an intrinsic value i e an exchange value that is inseparably connected with inherent in commodities seems a contradiction in terms
7417299 therefore first the valid exchange values of a given commodity express something equal secondly exchange value generally is only the mode of expression the phenomenal form or something contained in it yet distinguishable from it the exchange values of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all of which thing they represent a greater or less quantity this common something cannot be either a geometrical a chemical or any other natural property of commodities such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities make them use values but the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterized by a total abstraction from use value is just as good as another provided only it be present in sufficient quantity
7417300 all that these things now tell us is that human labour power has been expended in their production that human labour is embodied in them
7417301 total labour power of society which is embodied in the sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that society
7417302 the value of one commodity is to the value of any other as the labour time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the other in general the greater the productiveness of labour the less is the labour time required for the production of an article the less is the amount of labour crystallized in that article and the less is its value and vice versa the less the productiveness of labour the greater is the labour time required for the production of an article and the greater is its value the value of commodity therefore varies directly as the quantity and inversely as the productiveness of the labour incorporated in it
7417303 to become a commodity a product must be transferred to another whom it will serve as a use value by means of exchange lastly nothing can have value without being an object of utility if the thing is useless so is the labour contained in it the labour does not count as labour and therefore creates no value the labour whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its product or which manifests itself by making its product a use value we call useful labor in this connection we consider only its useful effect
7417304 human labour in the abstract the expenditure of human labour in general
7417305 a commodity appears at first sight a very trivial thing and easily understood its analysis shows that it is in reality a very queer thing abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties so far as it is a value in use there is nothing mysterious about it whether we consider it from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human wants or from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human wants or from the point that those properties are the product of human labour
7417306 this fetishism of commodities has its origin as the foregoing analysis has already shown in the peculiar social character of the labour that produces them
7417307 a commodity is therefore a mysterious thing simply because in it the social character of mens labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social relation existing not between themselves but between the products of their labour this is the reason why the products of labour become commodities social things whose qualities are at the same time perceptible and imperceptible by the senses in the same way the light from an object is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve but as the objective form of something outside the eye itself but in the act of seeing t here is a physical relation between physical things but it is different with commodities there the existence of the things qu commodities and the value relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities have absolutely no connection with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefrom there it is a definite social relation between men that assumes in their eyes the fantastic form of a relation between things this i call the fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour so soon as they are produced as commodities and which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities
7417308 the people came out of their houses and smelled the hot stinging air and covered their noses from it and the children came out of the houses but they did not run or shout as they would have done after a rain men stood by their fences and looked at the ruined corn drying were silent and they did not move often and the women came out of the houses to stand beside their men to fell whether this time the men would break the women studied the mens faces secretly for the corn could go as long as something else remained the children stood near by drawing figures in the dust with bare toes and the children sent exploring senses out to see whether men and women would break the children peeked at the faces of the men and women and then drew careful lines in the dust with their toes horses came to the watering troughs and nuzzled the water to clear the surface dust after a while the faces of the watching men lost their bemused perplexity and became hard and angry and resistant then the women knew that they were safe and that there was no break then they asked whatll we do and the men replied i dont know but it was all right the women knew it was all right and the watching children knew it was all right women and children knew deep in themselves that no misfortune was too great to bear if their men were whole the women went into the houses to their work and the children began to play but cautiously at first as the day went forward the sun became less red it flared down on the dust blanketed land the men sat in the doorways of their houses their hands were busy with sticks and little rocks the men sat still thinking figuring

7417314 water is inundated to five feet here nearly 100 000 people have been displaced and water is not receding the state government should have been cautious at such time particularly when it has promised to take up flood protection work in time on the basis of past experience but the situation is painful we are with the people of the state in such hour of crisis
7417315 it seems like new york firms have a thing for bay windows but not the usual

7417320 brooklyn architects solid objectives idenburg liu so il have designed a rooftop landscape of allotments to showcase green roof technologies on an industrial building in queens new york city garden city roofs a company that specialises in green roof systems planyc in which he call for buildings to be more energy efficient by 2030 interest in green roofs is on the rise
7417321 our client is a start up company who is catering to this new interest mostly by inexperienced building owners
7417322 she is providing a one stop shop where one can learn about the roughly half a dozen systems available get structural engineering advices tax rebate advice installer and maintenance recommendation
7417323 we have designed the allotments and a small sales offices that doubles as a display for

7417325 comes complete with an altar an apse and a confessional
7417326 kept an eye on the rules and made sure we paid attention to that
7417327 this party was less about sen durbin and congressman emanuel being leaders in congress
7417328 it was more about them being prominent illinoisans who are friends of barack obamas and want to celebrate the fact that a fellow illinoisan will be nominated by his party to be president
7417329 going into it there is a sense of seriousness and purpose at hand almost every democrat no matter who they supported in the primary initially believes that a bush mccain presidency and four more years of those policies would be a disaster and im not being hyperbolic for the country
7417330 theres a much greater degree of confidence than four years ago
7417331 people want to see change theres a lot of optimism and a lot of energy
7417332 weve learned the idea that we should be above the fray and not engaged in this dogfight thats over
7417333 people in colorado and in the west are of the view that we need to have a new beginning we need to turn the page we need change i think thats the kind of candidacy barack obama brings to the presidency and thats the message we will see at the national convention
7417334 this is about getting out the vote and its about registering millions of new voters in order to win
7417335 a lot of this is going to be about not just about the pomp and circumstance thats going to be on television its going to be a lot of behind the scenes stuff in getting these folks to be a part of the campaign an active part of the campaign because we need every one of them
7417336 it was kind of fun to be able to pick four extraordinary women
7417337 virtually every time there is a contest somebody besides the nominee gets placed in nomination
7417338 she always says the right thing and is incredibly helpful and i think this is another opportunity for her to be incredibly helpful
7417339 what i think we see now is a candidate who believes in the 50 state strategy which is terrific and understands that if you cant expand the electoral map it kind of limits your opportunity to be a national party
7417340 were going to end up with all that data and all that infrastructure after this is over
7417341 and its going to help congressional candidates and senatorial candidates its going to help governors i mean in 2010 what this campaign is going to do for the electoral map all over the country is extraordinary
7417342 you cannot go back and just do the things that youve always done especially if you lose
7417343 it was time to try something different and get out of our core base area and go into places that we havent been for a long time im very pleased with denver
7417344 when i look every day the big oil companys building is right out there next to me and its quite a reminder that we should have mutually beneficial relationships with the oil industry
7417345 ive lived through this a long time and ive watched you know everybodys got these buzzwords about change my argument about change is to what
7417346 when people talk about change id like to see what theyre changing it to but nobody wants to talk about that
7417347 this race has been about who can do the best for the state they need somebody who knows how to do the job back there and i know how to do the job
7417348 and walked right past us and didnt say hello his wife did come over and speak with us which was very nice and cordial but he did not it kind of took me aback because these are his colleagues in congress and theyre all the way up here in alaska
7417349 clearly young has alienated his colleagues and isolated himself over the years
7417350 what i think that means for alaska is that we are not well represented
7417351 the extent of the effort is going to be staggering
7417352 in years past i dont think we have mounted an offense during the democrats convention and it would be a first for that this is an extraordinary election year and thats why it warrants extraordinary measures
7417353 there has been a very concerted effort on the part of the mccain campaign to basically counter what i perceive to be an unbelievable bias toward covering barack obama
7417354 i think theres going to be a lot of glitz and a lot of hype around the convention but our aim is talk about the reality of his voting record and his lack of leadership experience
7417355 hes got plenty of good surrogates who have done very well on his behalf
7417356 there are two kinds of surrogates those who have name recognition and can easily be covered and those who have really interesting things to say
7417357 but what i am hoping to do is comment in a way that has credibility that isnt over the top and causes people to think twice about sen obama
7417358 you can bet were going to have a more aggressive counteroperation in minnesota than what weve read about their effort in denver
7417359 it shows you are taking the race seriously but you also want to make sure your message gets heard
7417360 sending current and former elected officials into the fray is guaranteed to generate media coverage not only to try to frame the message but also to try to blunt the democrat bounce they usually get from the convention
7417361 dream in color how the s nchez sisters are making history in congress
7417362 the first step toward making anything happen is to believe its possible
7417363 ive had members proposition me and there are even ones twice my age who have this sort of rock star mentality that everybody wants to be their groupie when they are turned down politely but firmly some of them still wont take no for an answer soon the word gets around they are the ones to avoid the ones who are always a little too friendly or a little too touchy feely
7417364 among the women in congress there are probably one or two who try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7417365 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation the old women should be seen and not heard mentality and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7417366 its actually one of the best times to send a contingent out because its recess and of course its generally less active on the hill
7417367 weve had weekends where you might see three major sports events in the same area
7417368 it doesnt make much difference whether its denver st paul boston or new york
7417369 it all really requires a lot of cooperation between the state local and federal agencies
7417370 in general its like what we do with any large gathering where there are going to be a lot of people
7417371 were always employing counterterrorism techniques its pretty much the same thing we do every day here on the hill
7417372 we have a template we put in place that weve used at other venues it comes down to working off all of our partners
7417373 we take information from a lot of different areas from the local police federal agencies and we consume a lot of information to help formulate a plan we like to think were getting ready for any scenario
7417374 well here in the 21st century we usually just kind of assume it would go the other way
7417375 when the road of excess has reached the palace of wisdom it is a healed wound a long scar
7417376 is not only prodigal extravagance but also an assumed limitlessness
7417377 our human and earthly limits properly understood are not confinements but rather inducements to formal elaboration and elegance to fullness of relationship and meaning
7417378 does not propose to enlarge itself by limitless extension but rather to enrich itself within bounds that are accepted prior to the work it is the artists not the scientists who have dealt unremittingly with the problem of limits

7417386 in islam there is no separation between the secular and the sacred the law is suffused with religion
7417387 the islamic sharia is not an easily identifiable set of rules that can be mechanically applied but a long and quite varied intellectual tradition
7417388 all civil penal financial economic administrative cultural military political and other laws and regulations must be based on islamic criteria
7417389 all existing laws shall be brought in conformity with the injunctions of islam as laid down in the holy quran and sunna and no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to such injunctions
7417390 already playing a significant role in the financial systems in the middle east
7417391 many modern islamic nations say they guarantee freedom of religion but this does not necessarily include the right to speak openly against islam and act on those ideas
7417392 who want the restoration of islamic law lock stock and barrel
7417393 we of the church believe that all men have inalienable rights to think freely to talk freely to write freely their own opinions and to counter or utter or write upon the opinions of others
7417394 our technology has not been discovered by a group true if the group had not supported me in many ways i could not have discovered it either but it remains that if in its formative stages it was not discovered by a group then group efforts one can safely assume will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future
7417395 you have to eat a pound of dirt to officially make it through childhood
7417396 to be truthful i didnt think anything like this would happen
7417397 i have never endorsed in a presidential primary before but i really believe events require us to stand up and be counted
7417398 he unites rather than divides he has the unusual ability to inspire and to lift people to be better that is a rare skill and something thats needed
7417399 he understands the need to change our fiscal course and address long term challenges including health care cost growth and tax reform
7417400 i think conrad will provide counsel for obama and let him know that its a very high priority to deal with long term deficit problems
7417401 this administration will now leave office with the worst record of fiscal responsibility in the history of the country
7417402 he squandered a record surplus and left us deep in debt
7417403 this cycle you have so many more media outlets looking for content and celebrities are magnets for them so there are a lot more opportunities
7417404 i really have the feeling that the whole world is watching this one
7417405 some will bring nothing but themselves and might detract from whats important at the convention
7417406 and some will be good because they have an issue that they know and care passionately about and theyll be there to form relationships and communicate a message to lawmakers
7417407 its much more common now than it used to be so its generating its own backlash
7417408 the mccain campaign is trying to turn the word celebrity into a dirty word and thats not appropriate mccain is a celebrity and he wants to be an even bigger one
7417409 in those days there was a sense that there was this world of fame and it was the first time that somebody was going to be president who was going to be like a movie star
7417410 i dont think it has that kind of aura that it used to have
7417411 do french movie stars and british movie stars go around endorsing candidates with the same sort of frequency we do i would say certainly not with the same kind of frequency
7417412 i think that its terrific that both presidential candidates recognize the value of r amp d
7417413 its hard for companies to make r amp d budget plans not knowing when the r amp d credit is going to expire
7417414 the political reality is that it would be extended for at least one year
7417415 his overall package is just too hard for us to swallow
7417416 ive heard that mccain doesnt like reading in print about lobbyists who are helping
7417417 i dont know how much they will utilize me yet
7417418 im planning to be in denver helping to dispel misconceptions and doing whatever the mccain folks ask me to do
7417419 im completely honored to be participating in this particular delegation
7417420 ive been really blessed to have been on the road with mccain i will of course do whatever they ask me to do
7417421 for some of the speakers the real high profile ones they have their own speechwriters or staff
7417422 what we do is make sure theyre not off the reservation and make sure the themes the campaign wants woven in are woven in
7417423 it could be the national committee woman from vermont we contact them to know what their time slot is do the rehearsal vet their speeches and help them with the podium walkthrough
7417424 start later and spread it out so that the candidates dont have to all be working 20 states on the same day which is what happened this year
7417425 as long as they keep arguing with each other nothing gets done ill listen to what musgrave and markey are talking about this year and decide from there
7417426 we need to go again to washington d c to solve these problems as americans
7417427 and if we look at both what democrats are talking about and what republicans are talking about theres a lot of common ground there take away the rhetoric lets look at the common ground and work from there
7417428 with denver being our headquarters town we were approached very early in the process in trying to attract the convention to denver as an opportunity to showcase the company internationally
7417429 what were getting out of our sponsorship is we hope a lot of brand recognition
7417430 obviously when the convention is on television the democratic party is very guarded about their brand and their efforts to promote their candidate so its going to be far more subtle
7417431 we do have a signature building downtown that hopefully will end up in a lot of night shots in the citys skyline and weve been looking at various advertising and marketing opportunities with the delegates
7417432 this is a great opportunity for us to serve as a connection for the business and government communities
7417433 while the convention is in some respects an ultimate partisan event its really a nonpartisan activity thats wonderful for the business community
7417434 what a great showcase for the city even as a republican i plan to go to the acceptance speech at invesco field and really just enjoy the whole festivities
7417435 its a high profile event that really showcases our city and our state we wanted to help make that happen
7417436 we have a number of events that are being held at the office as a result of people within the firm being contacted by friends and business acquaintances
7417437 hopefully that would show up in any interview with the delegates
7417438 this is not a unique opportunity for us to have policy discussions
7417439 that said it is a way for us to further develop our personal relationships with folks influencers
7417440 policymakers are going to be more focused on the convention
7417441 they arent going to want to talk about universal services reform
7417442 sen obama made renegotiating nafta a major priority during the primaries so we would assume that would be one of the first things he would do
7417443 the first thing the mexicans are going to say is fine lets review the agreement
7417444 theyve got agenda items too that will be well chosen and are things that we are not going to want to concede
7417445 we are fully prepared to attack this head on after the first of the year if in fact that scenario proves to be true
7417446 the american consumer and businessperson cannot afford to take a timeout on trade nor can our trading partners around the world
7417447 we will ramp our efforts up even more across the country because this is where we win this in the small towns around the country and the cities outside of washington
7417448 we have momentum a momentum that we have built through all of the trade agreements that weve had over the course of the last several years
7417449 the structure of trade has changed dramatically over the last 15 years it used to be that competition was among the u s the european union and japan now its dramatically changed now you have other countries that have every different trade structures conditions have changed so policies have to change
7417450 theyre talking about revising nafta but there are lots of ways you can go about this in terms of additional side agreements
7417451 it does not have to be opened up so that it would be subject to another up or down vote in the senate
7417452 george bush has pursued policies that dont work for working americans
7417453 in recent years weve seen more than 3 million high quality manufacturing jobs disappear and more than 40 000 factories close down
7417454 economists will probably argue for the next 50 years over what the net job loss is for every study that the left can come up with that shows job losses the right can come up with one that shows job gains
7417455 i dont think that much is accomplished by hosting parties in terms of the legislative agenda so were not trying to compete on that basis
7417456 frankly im pretty confident about the level of support working families get from the democratic party businesses may be less secure and may be looking for ways to get attention
7417457 a lot of our events are about calling attention to what we think needs to be the priorities in the obama administration all of our events are really substantive
7417458 close loopholes that allow rampant unregulated oil speculation and to support giving the commodities futures trading commission cftc greater regulatory and enforcement authority
7417459 i see little difference between auth script amp sym links except that in the auth script example windows users are a little happier does support symlinks that relates to betterthan

7417502 but this is not a national organising committee which is going to sit on its laurels and nor are the athletes we will want to make sure that we deliver the best for britain in 2012 so we are going to be looking to go higher
7417503 if you had asked me this two weeks ago i would have said impossible
7417504 the phrase we used was fourth in the medals is the best we can hope to achieve given a nation of our size
7417505 but we look at these games and what has happened to the russians if they are in reach then theres no reason to constrain our ambitions

7417507 if youre able to kill your family member before that conversion process is complete youre actually doing them a favor because theyre still going to die a muslim theyre still going to have some chance of going to muslim paradise after death

7417514 pada hari itu 15 ogos saya saya diarahkan oleh orang atasan saya untuk menjadi saksi sumpah saiful bukhari saya antara empat orang imam yang diarahkan untuk menjadi saksi
7417515 sumpah itu bukan saya yang aturkan teksnya disediakan oleh peguamnya atau mungkin ada orang lain yang buat itu
7417516 apabila dia saiful membacakan teks dia seolah olah tidak merasa bersalah
7417517 kalau kita seorang islam yang beriman kalau kita nak bersumpah ini kita akan takut apa akan terjadi tetapi kerana teks ucapan yang dibacakan itu dia tak rasa bersalah

7417525 saya bukan imam besar di situ saya cuma imam biasa sahaja imam besarnya ialah haji abdul malek saleh di televisyen mengatakan saya iman besar di situ salah sama sekali kerana kehadiran saya di situ untuk menikahkan pasangan pengantin

7417565 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7417566 elaborate upon his stated intention to reduce the number of abortions by providing alternative programs
7417567 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7417568 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7417569 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7417570 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7417571 there still is a possibility that obama will chip into the republican advantage with this religious outreach
7417572 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election
7417573 people who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster

7417575 hey destiny this is andrew you and i hung out with kevin and lisa last week in case you didnt remember anyways im going to be free saturday night after 10pm if you want to hang out i have a few beers left heres my number

7417579 im definitely grateful that im a part of the acting business if thats because of idol then thats because of idol
7417580 im not afraid to look back to where i got my start
7417581 the green party has always stood for gender equity the green party has always stood for racial equality and so people particularly members of the corporate press for various reasons of their own have chosen to pigeon hole the green party as just a party for people who love nature
7417582 well of course we love nature i would hope that everyone loves and appreciates nature particularly since nature gives life and helps sustain that life
7417583 we are proud to run an all female ticket and hope that change will continue to occur as virginia woodhull worked for change over 100 years ago
7417584 women candidates and women successes particularly the candidacy of hillary clinton show that more americans are willing to accept a woman or a person of color as the chief executive
7417585 the green party in the united states has taken their progressive stands on racial issues gender issues and value issues in support of people of color and in support of women
7417586 so its a natural outflowing of the green partys stated values that they would eventually have a ticket that was comprised of women of color people of color the more women run the more women will win
7417587 smart as in sheer raw intelligence you know smart or like being president of the harvard law review and a professor of law smart as opposed to say dubya or even john mccain who graduated 894 of 899 from the naval academy

7417611 the first step must be to get off the wrong battlefield in iraq and take the fight to the terrorists in afghanistan and pakistan
7417612 for many years i have been ashamed mortally ashamed of having been even with the best intentions even at many removes a murderer in my turn as time went on i merely learned that even those who were better than the rest could not keep themselves nowadays from killing or letting others kill because such is the logic by which they live and that we cant stir a finger in this world without the risk of bringing death to somebody i only know that one must do what one can to cease being plague striken and thats the only way in which we can hope for some peace or failing that a decent death this and only this can bring relief to men and if not save them at least do them the least harm possible and even sometimes a little good so that is why i resolved to have no truck with anything which directly or indirectly for good reasons or for bad brings death to anyone or justifies others putting him to death
7417613 im not sure what im going to do writing on this thing i may just blabber and not mention that its alive every fucker has a blog yes why not why not

7417756 barrington high school is less than a quarter mile away from ej amp e tracks
7417757 any student who is walking across those tracks every day were not only worrying about them getting hit but standing out there in the cold for extended periods of time
7417758 pretty much anywhere our buses go theyre crossing the tracks
7417759 would have an impact on our ability to get our buses to and from school
7417760 my frustration is they led us to believe they would finish this development

7417762 when we moved in there was a school planned and a community pool and a workout facility but we dont have them but there are three ponds and they did a beautiful job of tying in the open spaces with the natural landscape were not panicking we realize a home is a long term investment
7417763 we wanted to keep the residents up to date on whats happening
7417764 their main concern is having the trash removed they also dont want to see another developer come in and build just anything we assured them that wouldnt happen
7417765 but theres a fine line between working with kimball hill on maintaining the property and complicating the issues
7417766 were hopeful that a developer will come in when the market turns around

7417776 we have residents who are going back to college because were giving them back their freedom by taking away some of their burdens of life
7417777 but when will there be policy changes when these young people can live with neighbors who are not disabled too
7417778 a lot of these places are classified differently so its not something everyone with medicaid can access
7417779 im the first person to admit that no matter how you are people want options
7417780 you find other people who are in your situation and exchange ideas and information its nice that i can share stories with people who have gone through some of the same experiences or can help because theyve experienced some of the same things

7417897 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7417898 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7417899 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7417900 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7417901 bill was telling me that badminton is also insanely popular there
7417902 so then i asked him to compare ok youve got three implementations of whats fundamentally the same game tennis badminton and ping pong how do they differ so we started discussing the parameters of it
7417903 a na ve guy like me watching these expert ping pong guys
7417904 theres this blur of the white ball but man the rallys lasting forever versus tennis ive watched a few times the guy goes ka whap with his blinding serve and thats it if you can break his serve youre there bill says badminton is kind of in the middle
7417905 i bet its part physics and part rules with badminton you cant do anything like those serves because the thing the shuttlecock resists going fast probably theres a reynolds number effect thats the same thing in ping pong although it goes fast the coverage of the table is such that itd be like tennis if either the ball was really slow or you could run really fast because you can actually move your only played it a couple times in my life but its only this far that youre moving it so its probably something like the ratio of the ball speed to lining up on it and then if thats true youd expect that doubles might be different because each player has a more limited field so youve cut their angle down so something can come cross wise in ways you wouldnt otherwise be able to do but thats just a guess itd be fun to see if someone has looked into this youd like to get some stats like from the olympics
7417906 to invent you need a good imagination and a pile of junk
7417907 imagine a swimming pool thats infinitely long and wide but only an inch deep
7417908 he thought he had created something really special the next great quality assurance testing tool
7417909 a body of knowledge and a group of experts who understood software security better than anybody on the planet
7417910 we were training organizations like microsoft and sap how to find security vulnerabilities and fix them
7417911 but on the government side we were showing these agencies how to exploit those same vulnerabilities for intelligence gathering purposes
7417912 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7417913 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7417914 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7417915 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7417916 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7417917 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7417918 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7417919 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7417920 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7417921 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7417922 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7417923 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7417924 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7417925 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7417926 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7417927 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7417928 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7417929 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7417930 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7417931 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7417932 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7417933 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7417934 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7417935 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7417936 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7417937 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7417938 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7417939 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7417940 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7417941 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7417942 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7417943 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7417944 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7417945 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7417946 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7417947 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7417948 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7417949 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7417950 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7417951 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7417952 i dont want to hit all my home runs in the preseason but its what i plan to do
7417953 we wanted to play much better to open up the stadium but it didnt happen they outplayed us tonight
7417954 offensively we didnt have a lot of rhythm but we didnt have the ball a lot
7417955 in the second half we had a chance to get back in it but the turnovers really took the wind out of our sails
7417956 he handled the information we got in and out it was a noisy game and it could have been noisier but we got off to that good start
7417957 the touchdown was a plus but it could have been a whole lot better
7417958 weve got to get back to protecting the ball like the colts normally do
7417959 i told the team after the game that this was kind of a normal nfl game
7417960 if you could keep from turning the ball over and can win the turnover battle youll have a real good chance of winning the game thats what happened
7417961 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7417962 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7417963 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7417964 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7417965 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7417966 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7417967 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7417968 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7417969 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7417970 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7417971 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7417972 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7417973 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7417974 im concerned about the big plays that got called back ive seen thomas run against us in
7417975 i think we have a great combination with our two backs i think we have an outstanding line its just how quickly our chemistry can come together
7417976 coaches may say okay guys im not going to let you sit out this game but i want you to practice i say heck if im going to practice im going to play at least a series otherwise its really a long time until you play another game
7417977 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7417978 this is a planning took where all things are going
7417979 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7417980 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7417981 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7417982 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7417983 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

7417987 things im proud of having accomplished with the deeprockdrive team
7417988 things i wish id have done differently with my first startup
7417989 building a startup is the most difficult and most rewarding thing anyone can do sometimes you can even make some money at the end of it all there are so many things that can go wrong it is a miracle when a startup actually makes it it is important to celebrate our successes learn from our failures and value them equally failure is important because success is a terrible teacher
7417990 we deeply mourn the loss of a respected leader in the oil and gas industry who was a mentor and a friend to so many of us in the business our company was fortunate to have someone of his stature and experience as a part of our board of directors
7417991 on behalf of all of our employees and the board of directors i extend our deepest sympathy to his wife kathy and the entire family

7417995 we have had contracts with both cekab and edb for card authorisation and capture of card transactions for many years and our experience of both companies has been good we are now able to bring these services together from a single supplier
7417996 this represents the first major shift in 100 years in the way concrete is prepared and the icrete system is available worldwide the rising costs of materials labor and concrete itself have no geographic borders
7417997 although the middle tier of the market makes up nearly half of overall it spending there are few dedicated it resources focused on this segment
7417998 we feel that there is a unique opportunity to create a new business model through the marriage of consulting solutions integration development and services that are solely focused on the under served mid market
7417999 by acquiring established local it providers around the globe and bringing them together under one umbrella sparxent will act as a single source for it providing the broadest array of expertise and tools to the middle market
7418000 the key to our comprehensive approach is to bridge the gap between vars that lack the software competency to provide true integration and software development companies that are not equipped to provide a breadth of consulting services

7418004 were going to have to make some decisions and its not sufficient for us to just finesse the issue because were worried that well we might be attacked for the various options we present
7418005 whats stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans whats stopped us is the failure of leadership the smallness of our politics the ease with which were distracted by the petty and trivial our chronic avoidance of tough decisions our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle the big problems of america

7418014 you dont want a blue ceiling to look like an afterthought or like it came out of nowhere

7418016 a traditional house would use a more traditional color something lighter on a contemporary house you can do something bolder something brighter
7418017 you want to keep the blue soft light and airy

7418032 the talk criticized some aspects of the traditional understanding and though promised immunity ford was summoned to the

7418035 the most rapid and massive exit of adventist pastors in the movements 150 year history
7418036 is still a member of the church and his personal lifestyle is distinctly adventist
7418037 almost two decades have passed since dr ford took his courageous stand for the gospel since that time it has become obvious that dr fords teachings have led many christians to a better understanding of personal salvation and the scripture in fact many within the seventh day adventist church have adopted his view of the gospel and his advanced position on the investigative judgment although it has been almost two decades since dr ford has been exiled from the denomination he is still a seventh day adventist who personally supports a vegetarian lifestyle as well as such fundamental doctrines as the seventh day sabbath second coming judgment state of the dead new earth etc

7418041 the united states reiterates its continued strong endorsement of nigerian institutions not individuals in their investigation and prosecution of all forms of corruption especially at the highest levels in this regard the united states is maintaining its support of efforts to strengthen nigerias anti corruption institutions
7418042 on numerous occasions the united states has underscored its backing of the goals of president yaraduas seven point reform agenda one of the central pillars in this program is the fight against corruption which is taking place through such institutions as the economic and financial crimes commission
7418043 we are expecting to begin using them frequently in and around that area and in places in jefferson and clallam counties

7418054 difficult to understand because the companys share price had slid from about 1 90 in mid june when it was announced
7418055 rocs operational and financial results for the half year have been somewhat overshadowed by the decline in the companys share price since the announcement of the proposed anzon takeover mr clement said
7418056 if successful roc will more than double its 2p reserves and increase its forecast production in 2010 to over 20 000 boepd barrels of oil equivalent per day
7418057 the takeover will immediately increase operating cash flow for the company by up to 50 and expose roc to significant upside reserves potential from the development of the basker manta gummy project in bass strait over the next 18 months structures and career paths shift
7418058 to ensure we would be in a position to get the settings right and provide continuity during a difficult period
7418059 nothing changed expect to the extent that when we extended mikes contract we believed and we were absolutely right that we were entering a very difficult environment
7418060 we wanted to have the option of security of tenure we also wanted mike to get the setting right for us as we got into the storm
7418061 we believe weve probably passed through the eye of the storm
7418062 weve had that continuity and weve now come to an agreement with mike that he step down
7418063 i cant say that the markets are turning very quickly but were prepared for the environment were in
7418064 i actually think that challengers benefited from the relationship weve had with mike as ive said hes done a great job

7418067 for decades john conyers has been the conscience of the congress a model of what it means to be an elected leader whose mission in office is not to enrich the corporations and the people who like john mccain have ten homes
7418068 tonight we honor john as a civil rights champion and pioneer
7418069 what may be even more shocking is that 40 years later that inequality and injustice is greater than ever
7418070 dr kings quest for justice can not be fully realized until the day when our health care is no longer determined by wealth but by patient need
7418071 while johns bill hr 676 has more co sponsors than any health reform in congress there are still far too many who want to stop far short of what is needed to cure our national nightmare
7418072 people who think more insurance whether youre forcing people to buy private insurance or simply giving them public subsidies to buy it is somehow universal healthcare
7418073 as long as insurance companies can continue to deny care because they dont want to pay for it and cancel coverage for people when they get sick
7418074 as long as insurance companies and drug companies and hospitals can continue to charge what ever they want and siphon off 30 cents of every healthcare dollar for billing profits and executive pay
7418075 well continue to have a medical system that has made the u s last in the world among industrialized countries in preventable deaths
7418076 if we matched the criteria of those other countries 100 000 fewer americans would die prematurely every year thats 25 times the number of americans who have died in iraq
7418077 so why are some of our friends telling us to settle for what is politically expedient for conventional wisdom about what can we achieved
7418078 if the civil rights movement taught us anything it taught us the importance of struggle
7418079 it taught us that police dogs and jim crow laws and the politicians and the media experts telling us to go slow were wrong
7418080 they were on the wrong side of history they were on the wrong side of humanity
7418081 it taught us that when millions of people get riled up when we unite our power when we get into the streets and the court of public opinion that we can move mountains and we can change the world
7418082 lets honor the civil rights movement for what it has achieved and what we still need to achieve
7418083 our view is that the market will grow by be zero to three per cent in this six months we have no visibility beyond that

7418094 putting a price on carbon is the most important step we can to take to reduce emissions as president my first priority to combat global warming will be enacting an economy wide cap on u s carbon emissions that will reduce u s emissions by the amount scientists agree is necessary 80 for the u s to bear an equitable share of the global emissions reduction burden i will devote significant resources from a permit auction toward accelerating the development and deployment of low carbon technologies addressing the economic challenges imposed on key industrial sectors and providing meaningful incentives for action by developing countries another top priority for my energy and global warming agenda will be changing the cars we drive and the fossil fuels we burn i will increase fuel efficiency standards to the limits of technological and economic feasibility introduce legislation to lift the 60 000 per manufacturer cap on buyer tax credits to encourage more americans to buy ultra efficient vehicles and encourage automakers to make fuel efficient hybrid vehicles by helping them shoulder the health care costs of their retirees domestic automakers will get health care assistance in exchange for investing 50 percent of the savings into technology to produce more fuel efficient vehicles in addition i will provide automakers with generous tax incentives for retooling assembly plants to change the fuels we burn i introduced legislation to enact a national low carbon fuel standard that will reduce the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of passenger vehicle fuels sold in the u s by 10 percent in 2020 and require additional reductions of 1 annually thereafter
7418095 my first priority in office will be ending the war in iraq it is a boulder in the road that blocks our progress on all of our domestic priorities confronting our dependence on fossil fuels is a crucial part of that process if we dont leave a stable iraq and we dont deal with our dependence on oil we will have to send our children and grandchildren back to the region so energy security which includes reducing demand for oil substantially increasing efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be a top priority of my first 100 days it is time for a national energy policy that moves the country into an alternative energy future key components of that policy will include raising fuel economy standards expanding energy efficiency programs and requiring government offices to be become more efficient and significantly increasing national investment in energy technology it is not enough to simply contain greenhouse gas emissions here in the us and reduce our own dependence on oil for our national security we need a global solution to both climate change and oil dependence to that end i will return the us to a real leadership position on climate change immediately the first steps have to be imposing limits on greenhouse gas emissions here in the us through a domestic cap and trade program and investments in new technologies and energy savings we must attack this problem on every front at the same time we need to move on the international front building trust and commitments among major emitters with the goal of a post 2012 framework that includes the united states and the major emerging emitters like china and india after seven years of doing nothing about climate change we cant afford to let the issue sit on the side
7418096 he didnt even get a chance to make it to the hospital

7418098 the most difficult thing is making the plans to come home and tell your children
7418099 the biggest contributing factor is there is no ambulances available to send anywhere near the airport or even available to cover that whole side of the city
7418100 the hospital routinely runs out of advance life support ambulances and theres no one available to send theyre aware of the problem theyve been aware of the problem for a long time and theyve decided not to fix it
7418101 people absolutely are waiting for ambulances longer than they should
7418102 were understaffed we have half as many ambulances as our next closest city
7418103 are you at all embarrassed by a 33 minute ambulance response time
7418104 i would have liked it to be about 28 minutes that would have been the best we could have done
7418105 there are times in every city when the system is overloaded with calls when you cant get an ambulance to respond from a very close in place
7418106 no because the care was completely appropriate the entire time had the ambulance gotten there five minutes earlier the patient would have arrested just as he was being put into the ambulance rather than a couple of minutes before
7418107 i hope we dont have that kind of attitude thats unfortunate to hear that from any authority or any medical facility in our city
7418108 clearly this stops as far as im concerned at the desk of dr patti gabow who has to pull out all tools all skills and leadership to address this issue and address it very fast
7418109 to me therere red flags already up in the air how many more events have to happen before a change is put in place
7418110 if i am capable of grasping god objectively i do not believe but precisely because i cannot do this i must believe if i wish to preserve myself in faith i must constantly be intent upon holding fast the objective uncertainty so as to remain out upon the deep over seventy thousand fathoms of water still preserving my faith
7418111 part of the reason im deploying people like that is so people feel comfortable
7418112 because i think there is some anxiety about the size of the event the fact that the federal government is involved people have read a lot of things theyve seen things in other countries i want them to feel comfortable
7418113 it doesnt make people feel safer it makes them more tense people feel like something is definitely going to happen

7418142 these are people who are the poorest of the poor mainly coming from rural areas who are landless farmers uneducated and unskilled so they have no jobs they come to the cities to ride rickshaws and earn about rs200 about 4 60 usd a day which can sustain their families so it will create employment problems

7418203 he said he got to see all the great operas at the met and didnt have to pay for one of them
7418204 he was never a man of means but he had a knack of always making sure we had what we needed
7418205 it is only two games if it was the last games of the season maybe there would be pressure but now no
7418206 i think teams have time now to lose some points
7418207 i understand that we didnt play like last week but i also understand the reasons why
7418208 wigan played better than portsmouth they pressured us and they were playing at home the people can help more than they can when we are at stamford bridge
7418209 also i have had many problems this week michael ballack played with a little injury michael essien has not been training for 10 days then trains for two and i needed him to play 90 minutes and mikel john obi is out
7418210 but they fought and it was possible to win the game it is fantastic for chelsea and fantastic for our group because we have confidence and we have six points
7418211 in my eyes yes we did enough i think most people who witnessed it would say that too
7418212 but they have given everything when you play these big teams sometimes you have to ride your luck we didnt have to do that because we played well against them
7418213 when you analyse it our goalkeeper didnt have a save to make thats almost unheard of against chelsea and they will go away thinking we nicked that one
7418214 for me robinho is the same player as always he is an important player who should be part of this project
7418215 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time
7418216 without doubt its not a comfortable situation either for him or for us
7418217 he continues with the team because we are going to see what happens we need to think that he could also remain with the team this season
7418218 his declarations have been inopportune but nobody is going to be kept at the club against their will
7418219 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline
7418220 i have a lot of respect for crouch and defoe
7418221 they are good players and will score a lot of goals this year especially at home
7418222 crouch is tall and wins most things in the air and defoe is very quick around the box he is a sharp player who makes problems for defenders
7418223 but as defenders we are here to deal with situations like that
7418224 we know who we are playing against so we need to prepare properly because it is very important we get the three points
7418225 we have started badly but it is a long season and we have plenty of time to put it right
7418226 it will not be easy portsmouth will want to show they are not as bad as they looked last week but we will be ready
7418227 i am not saying portsmouth are bad but when it is one of the top teams the community shield is like a derby and you really want to win
7418228 one of its unique features is that characters will be able to age grow beards and show battle wounds although sadly this wont be in the game at launch
7418229 recent acts of terrorism in kabul against the indian embassy there and in indian cities have led to a new trade of accusations islamabad has denied involvement skirmishes along the loc line of control in kashmir have added to mounting tensions
7418230 the challenge for the new coalition government is to see if it can repair the immediate damage and move towards constructing a stronger relationship with india
7418231 establishing itself as a stable cohesive force at home would be a vital step in this task
7418232 only a government that is firmly in control of its own helm can hope to enter into talks with a potentially hostile neighbour with any degree of success
7418233 some of his actions seem to have been largely cosmetic even where his own will to move forward was strong he was thwarted by others adopting a more hawkish line
7418234 the conviction that jihad in kashmir needs backing remains strongly rooted in some quarters
7418235 needs to challenge this mindset and persuade people that evolving a new relationship of trust and cooperation with india is vital in the longer run to the safety and welfare of the people of the region no matter which country or territory they live in
7418236 worked actively to build closer ties with pakistans giant neighbour to the east
7418237 his visit to agra in the summer of 2001 had helped relations move many paces forward even a breakthrough on kashmir looked possible at one stage and there was early hope of a complete turnaround in relations between the neighbours who had fought two wars since independence
7418238 the fact that musharraf who had participated in hostilities was willing to abandon the traditional military view on india was seen as significant
7418239 the early hope of agra faded the fact that musharraf was not an elected leader hindered talks but despite this with some help from his friends in the white house and elsewhere musharraf was also able to help dissipate the alarming tensions that emerged following the december 2001 terrorist attack on the indian parliament
7418240 the indians had long argued that jihadi outfits in the disputed territory were backed by pakistans establishment at least on paper the activities of militant militias were largely halted
7418241 the period of relative calm in kashmir made it possible for people to move back to border villages for divided families to meet and for movement across the border to take place similar confidence building measures slightly eased travel between pakistan and india tensions were lowered and over the last year selected indian films have played in pakistan
7418242 seems to have been a success but there have been alarming indications that much of what has happened since 2001 is cosmetic
7418243 reports since 2005 say the jihadi outfits are still being retained and covertly supported indeed some of these groups surfaced quite openly in the aftermath of the october 2005 earthquake their relief efforts suggesting they remained well organised and well equipped armies of militants
7418244 their presence has led to concerns over whether there is any real change on policy towards india the consequences of this reality have now been left to the coalition government to tackle
7418245 this would be a very bad move indeed dr shumack said
7418246 the college fears that appropriate people may not be given it inappropriate people may be given it and the side effects may not be managed appropriately
7418247 and overall far more people will be given it which increases the risk of pregnancies especially if this is not properly screened for and then theres more abortions
7418248 it would be mad to base too many judgements on the strength of just one match or even two
7418249 the league wont settle down until about christmas and it will be time to re evaluate things then if we stay strong we can stay in the running
7418250 weve got to assemble a team now and see where we are after the transfer window closes next week you must stay confident it is no good telling yourself you cant win this cant win that
7418251 given the right situations i think we will still do well there are a lot of teams who can do well this season and we hope we are one of them
7418252 if nothing else weve got to match uniteds work rate
7418253 the start has gone very well for me personally but from a captaincy point of view the players have been absolutely brilliant
7418254 you never know how people will take the change on but it has been taken on by everybody in such a positive manner
7418255 i have just tried to drum into them the way i want us to play and they have accepted that in the best possible way
7418256 he will bat at six bowl his medium pace and field at backward point and he has 150 games of one day international experience
7418257 so to have him back with the ability he has got and that kind of experience is an extra boost as well
7418258 morne bowled the equivalent of six overs in the nets in two spells of four overs and two overs
7418259 he was only operating at about 50 per cent of his capacity so we will have to step him up quite a bit if he is to make tuesdays second match
7418260 i knew he was a good player and you saw that as well
7418261 you always hope that when you introduce someone who hasnt plied their trade in the premier league they will make an instant impact
7418262 vincent has presence an understanding of the game and he recognises danger when those situations occur he nips these things in the bud
7418263 he has the flexibility i like in players and the ability to play in a number of positions his performance was key to our victory
7418264 this was a big win for us irrespective of the fact west ham went down to 10 men so early i felt we were in control
7418265 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7418266 it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was always going to be one winner
7418267 i do not think any one of my players can hold their hands up and say they performed
7418268 given the personnel we have available i do not think we were equipped to play with 10 men
7418269 we needed to defend in the second half with our lives and the first goal is always important
7418270 this institution has significant funding as do the other institutions both here in canberra and also around australia

7418280 thats his home and he spent a huge part of his career in san diego with that organization
7418281 to come back his first year and get embarrassed in the season series he had to take that with him this offseason im sure theres some vindication hes too much of a pro to admit it
7418282 its my worst birthday so far because im staring 30 in the face
7418283 theres not a lot of history as far as guys playing in the league besides javon and ronald
7418284 none of those guys has really played before so it would be tough to only go with two guys who have played before
7418285 we have some guys we can count on so well just look to the next guy
7418286 the last cuts some good people are getting let go on some of the good teams
7418287 its as bad as it can get as far as issues with the knee
7418288 i have to remind you guys that its preseason and you guys can figure out what that means
7418289 i wasnt able to accomplish what i really wanted which was to stay healthy
7418290 but any time you can overcome an injury and throw up zeros its nice
7418291 a couple of outings in a row joey has thrown the ball real well
7418292 we are still lagging behind in many events and disciplines in terms of medal counts and athletes ranked in the top eight were still lagging behind the u s is still number one and still much more powerful than china
7418293 we consider this one of our most successful engagements in the olympic games ever
7418294 we dont gauge our performances simply on the number of medals we achieve theres unlimited need and limited resources we need more resources
7418295 we need to focus on many sports where we really dont show up
7418296 there are lots of places where there are lots of medals and were not doing as well as we should we have to try to fill in the spots
7418297 i peek at the medal count every now and then
7418298 were all competitive we want to win all the gold medals
7418299 we do look at the medal count we take pride in what we can contribute
7418300 kyle moyer and my crew did a great job we started in ninth position and and to get a top 5 finish at a course that is very difficult to pass at is great we need to use this momentum going into belle isle next week and hopefully have a repeat finish
7418301 it was just one of those races there was a pretty clear track most of the time so it worked out
7418302 and that pretty much ended any chance we had of competing for a podium finish its a real shame
7418303 my filly is not getting as much credit for some reason
7418304 they dont mention her but they mention the other two quite a bit i just wish once in awhile theyd mention my horse
7418305 if everything goes well well try the ladys secret because id like to find out if she can run on that racetrack the breeders cup is the goal
7418306 i found a little filling on the tendon on the outside of his left foreleg this morning
7418307 i took him to the track for some exercise and it almost all disappeared but i decided to have a veterinarian look at it
7418308 a small lesion showed and it was decided that he wouldnt run hes too good a horse and though its a small lesion we didnt want to take a chance of making it worse
7418309 i think really well probably come back home and unwind a bit and look at cal cup
7418310 but im not ruling anything out you never know how things change that other horse beat us fair and square but my horse dug in really well
7418311 if he hasnt played in the preseason it would be hard to start him
7418312 two things he said as we were standing outside the first class bathroom
7418313 well ill send it to you because its one of the most beautiful of his speeches obama said
7418314 in it kennedy argues that a countrys health cant be measured simply by its economic output
7418315 how did we get to this strange pass where up is down and down is up
7418316 how did the notion of economy become so totally uneconomic
7418317 based on unrealistic assumptions the policy fails to take into consideration the social and environmental problems happening due to mining it is bound to promote large scale exploitative mining and will therefore exacerbate conflict says sunita narain director of cse
7418318 we have huge problems in not granting permission to industry our hands are tied we cannot impose any standards we deem necessary
7418319 rapidly growing influence of mining on the political sector of the country
7418320 the issue involves law enforcement not being able to do their jobs effectively he said
7418321 and i told the tv cameraman exactly where i was going to go
7418322 in my perspective its a great and special week for us
7418323 imagine we have truck drivers driving 2 200 miles from charlotte back to here its like all the hard work it paid off unexpected hard work
7418324 im not upset with anything particularly we just did absolutely nothing right
7418325 i dont know why we stayed out there when the car in the front of us is three seconds slower and we couldnt make up track position
7418326 it really was killing him coming in second all the time
7418327 obviously in the beginning its like i want to win the race as well but its great to see him get the win and now that hes got his win he can relax a little
7418328 it wasnt as easy today as i wanted it to be when the yellow came out because its a catch 22 no matter what you did
7418329 and helio had to work a lot harder than maybe what he should have had to work
7418330 it worked out in the end we were able to put just the right amount of fuel in each time we stopped to be able to get the track position we needed so that we could rely on him running hard and pick up a second or two a lap when we had an open track so that was really the key to the race was him being on the gas all day
7418331 we were able to do great pit stops in and out laps were fantastic
7418332 and as soon as we got the lead it didnt sink in to me
7418333 on the first burst of gunfire children and women immediately become the victims and thousands of families flee and lose their homes as the fighting intensifies there are more victims and the psychosocial wounds caused by the war deepen
7418334 children are unable to sleep for fear that something might happen at night they cannot eat well and of course they are forced to stop schooling
7418335 oftentimes children get hungry and sick because of inadequate food and decent homes this is because government agencies are often not ready for these offensives are unable to organize the evacuation of civilians and could not ensure the welfare of the affected families especially the children
7418336 it is irresponsible and the damage resulting from these indiscriminate bombings by the military would be much bigger because they do not distinguish the targets as a result residents become fearful and their lives are threatened because no one is spared from these bombings
7418337 quite possibly syndicates across borders which manage to persuade their recruits through various modes of deception and intimidation
7418338 filipino victims are pushed to try their luck in singapore not only because of poverty but also because of the promise of a lucrative job overseas
7418339 the report states that the existence of a large number of bars pubs in singapores red light districts fuels the demand for filipino women
7418340 they are each charged a minimum of 100 as recruitment fee in the philippines and given roundtrip tickets where the return ticket is oftentimes fake a fake invitation letter and
7418341 but instead of having legitimate jobs filipino women reportedly end up working as prostitutes they are forced to provide sexual services to customers and earn commissions from alcoholic drinks to enable them to pay the 1 000 to 4 000 they allegedly owe their handlers

7418352 eddings and i will be linked forever because of that one play and now there are two plays
7418353 we need to get some wins minnesotas been playing good ball it doesnt seem like they lose very much so you want to get off the homestand with a win
7418354 all of these wins at this time of the year seem to really get magnified so hopefully that can kind of spur us on
7418355 b j i think what he said was the ball just drifted on him
7418356 well just have to talk to him about that i dont know that he exactly had in mind that pierzynski might tag up on that
7418357 i shouldnt have gone horrible baserunning but i was just looking for somebody to get close enough and luckily he did
7418358 what doug ruled at second base was even though a j did kind of stick his arm out to make contact aybar was still in his way so a j if he would have turned he wouldnt have been able to continue on to third
7418359 so after making the throw aybar is no longer in the act of fielding and he cant obstruct the runner which is what doug ruled happened
7418360 this kid shows up to win every day hes a smart player he knows how to win when a j s out there youve got to beat him because hes not going to lay down and get beat
7418361 i really like the way ive been swinging it and my at bats have been good
7418362 pinch hitting is difficult for the guys that are good at it and i normally dont have much experience with it i got ready my work was good and i didnt really care i went up there and just swung the bat and it happened
7418363 obviously the quantity is not going to be there for me in any form this year
7418364 but its the quality i can still get hopefully thats the first of some big hits whether it be during the regular season or the postseason
7418365 thats really all my focus is im trying not to kill myself on the other stuff because its just not attainable
7418366 we never want to get swept especially here playing on our home turf with the home crowd and playing a good team
7418367 i dont want to say this was the biggest game of the year but i think it ranks right up there this was not a must win but we needed that
7418368 if wise is not ready tomorrow then we have to make a move
7418369 im a guy that uses my legs a lot so it all depends on how i feel in baltimore if its at the point where i still cant run then theyll put me on the dl but i havent heard anything

7418381 we did have a sense from the little information we have that there was some mistreatment
7418382 that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7418383 this is our response to the mortar shelling by government forces in the area
7418384 this is an act which stands in absolute violation of islamic as well as local pakhtun traditions
7418385 yet the carefully orchestrated facade could not conceal a police state that tramples on human rights
7418386 the international olympic committee kept its head in the sand when faced with reports of violations of media access crackdowns and round ups and concerns about air pollution hazards
7418387 i want it to become a museum if that is what the public wants
7418388 but i will only donate the property on the condition that the government agrees to allow me to add a new complex to house a cinema a library and a retail area to show belongings materials and movies about bruce lee
7418389 if the government chooses not to support the plan i dont think it will be worth donating the property
7418390 you make sure you are focused on what your goal is and what you want to achieve
7418391 i dont know what makes me different it beats me
7418392 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
7418393 i think i managed to give hope to all the 40 somethings out there i hope that i showed them that if you want something bad enough you can get it
7418394 i always feel like i dont have that physical gift i just have the gift of determination and work but it would be so fun to also have the other side of it that athletes like michael phelps are blessed to have

7418412 with the centre more patients can seek treatment instead of awaiting their turns at government hospitals
7418413 i was told the patients need to bear only half of the cost as the centre is subsidised by the government
7418414 each patient is required to pay only rm50 as the foundation will chip in rm10 and the health ministry another rm50
7418415 son now you tell me right now what is so funny

7418418 i just had to send you a picture of my first mosaic attempt i purchased your kit at the ck convention in portland and thought the fall pictures would be a perfect opportunity to give it a try i think it turned out really good but did take me 2 hours to complete
7418419 an artist never questions her right to experience everything the world has to offer
7418420 you were my student and my assistant now were competition
7418421 the way americas public schools are sliding theyll all be this way in a few months i say lay back and enjoy it its a hell of a toboggan ride
7418422 these special cocktails need to be shared with the world
7418423 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7418424 i think theres real power in people reflecting upon a very real moment in history and seeing what that has to do with where we are now
7418425 he told us that nonviolence was a steady loving confrontation
7418426 for us in the labor movement this should be a no brainer
7418427 its complicated obviously by the fact that there has never been an african american candidate for president
7418428 they are going to say to so many of our white members in appalachia you cant vote for him hes black
7418429 weve got to say to them thats bull dont let them do this to us again we should have learned our lesson
7418430 her voice dropped a little bit and her eyes dropped down to the ground and she said because hes black
7418431 i said look around nemacolins a dying town therere no jobs here kids are moving away because theres no future here and heres a man barack obama whos going to fight for people like us and you wont vote for him because of the color of his skin
7418432 brothers and sisters we cant tap dance around the fact that there are a lot of folks out there just like that woman those of us who know better cant afford to look the other way
7418433 we cant afford to shrug our shoulders we cant afford to look away and we cant let those bigoted wisecracks to go unchallenged
7418434 thats why when we hear people say america is not ready for a black president we have to get in their faces
7418435 i think its better that the party appeal to its base but i dont want to criticize mr obamas campaign this is just a snapshot in time the real test will come when we see how he formulates policies in the white house
7418436 barack obama is a liberal with respect to three core concerns
7418437 hes for phasing out our involvement in iraq and not repeating the calamitous error of preventative war he supports moving toward universal health care and hes committed to investments in sustainable fuel and pulling back from oil dependency
7418438 like any person in real politics hell do a lot of dealing
7418439 so far you havent been seeing the mccain campaign claiming hes a far out radical leftist but theres a potency to racial politics in this country that could determine the outcome in november
7418440 just how its going to play out depends on whether voters who distrust obama because of his race are concentrated in a few places like rust belt states or scattered around the country
7418441 i dont know that labels are very illuminating but i think the future of liberalism is based on white workers coming back to the progressive coalition and i think thats happening
7418442 you could argue that a shift to democrats doesnt mean a shift to liberalism
7418443 is the democratic party shifting from being the party of ted kennedy to jim webb from liberal lions like sen carl levin to moderates like evan bayh of indiana
7418444 in some ways thats the contest thats going to play out this year and in the next few years
7418445 the john testers of montana the mark warners of virginia these are the folks we used to call blue dog democrats the ones from the right wing of the democratic party today some might argue theyre the future of it
7418446 im proud to be a liberal ive always been very clear about that and so have our members but no president in a nation as divided as this one is always going to do everything we want him to do every president has to chart a middle course and i will give the next president whoever he is plenty of time to do his work there are some very big things that need fixing and a lot of issues that people need to pay close attention to without getting caught up in what labels mean
7418447 pontificates parsons trouble is without the slightest hint of irony
7418448 rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from god for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if god were not with him
7418449 i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again
7418450 how can a man be born when he is old
7418451 surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born
7418452 i tell you the truth no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and the spirit flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit you should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again the wind blows wherever it pleases you hear its sound but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit
7418453 it did damage to the door frame of the shop and it got up into the overhang of the roof and scorched the wood
7418454 a vehicle was seen leaving the scene whether it was involved its not 100 per cent sure
7418455 its too early to say if they are connected but there were two different fire starts and they were quite some distance away from each other
7418456 if it had gone unnoticed there could have been a lot of damage
7418457 they really had to work at it this is laminated glass the same as in a vehicle they actually damaged the door kicking in the glass
7418458 it doesnt look like well be able to the save the tree
7418459 but we found they moved down the building as we boarded windows up
7418460 it was kicked off its mounts and rolled off the roof to the pavement below
7418461 i am surprised no one is seeing or hearing anything
7418462 this costs major money especially in glass replacement we could be working on other things at schools
7418463 we reserve the right to respond to the aggressions on the part of the agents of the state and c defence wants informant details in slaying of american indian movement member in south dakota fbi informant reported seeing aquash alive in feb
7418464 i eat here a lot but it was by chance that i discovered that the restaurants backlane is filthy
7418465 the workers prepare food near several large garbage bins and you can see cooking utensils choking up the lane
7418466 can you imagine eating contaminated food i dont know whether this is a coincidence or not but most of the food outlets here are located side by side with car workshops
7418467 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7418468 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7418469 tough luck gee im sorry for you but theres nothing i can do
7418470 take time to smell the flowers to enjoy the breeze and the showers
7418471 drinking with dad is just as bad as it can sow the seeds of alcoholism in adult life
7418472 my designs are meant for the woman who believes in herself and is ready to experiment with style my designs are contemporary and have a bold feel to them my opulent luxury fabrics help me to create a different look for women
7418473 my creations are an ode to womens beauty and i want them to look beautiful in every dress i design fashion pampers your inner soul and makes a person feel very special my designs give women what they want the most attention
7418474 when i launched my label i realised there was huge potential in mens wear everyone was dressing up women but there was a void in the mens section i took the plunge and it has paid off well
7418475 i have done ethnic wear for men resort wear cruise wear and cocktail dresses for women and i will soon foray into home furnishings interior and accessory designing
7418476 i was waiting for the right moment my export business gave me an inside view of the fashion world and i am glad to tell you that our designs are at par with international styles
7418477 my designs take inspiration from culture art and architecture i incorporate them all with minimal style i pay attention to the texture and the cuts of the fabric i dont make much use of embellishments in my designs
7418478 i would like to design for deepika padukone and sonam kapoor as i feel they have the perfect height and attitude to carry my creations

7418481 restrict oversized bags for daytime only as they look cool and chic but to make a statement carry a clutch in the evening
7418482 clutches in gold silver and metallic hues with little embroidery can go with any outfit but it is the neutral bling like dull gold and silver that stands apart
7418483 fashion for me is more about fusion my bags have an indian feel to them as i render them in a more traditional and contemporary manner
7418484 for my bags i use all sorts of woven fabrics like patola and kashid and have fused this with leather to give it a contemporary look
7418485 oversized detailed stitching sleek outer pockets print and textured fabric bags are very much in this season
7418486 most of our bags are accessorized with buckles rings buttons and studs
7418487 bright colours like red black cobalt fuchsia and orange are in but purple simply stands out
7418488 we use italian leather and sometimes nylon for our bags they enhance the durability and longevity of our products
7418489 major general jalandar shah commander of the zafar corp and major abdul jabar commander of a commando battalion were dismissed for neglecting their duties and concealing the facts of huge civilian casualties
7418490 the un has always maintained that civilian casualties are unacceptable and undermine the trust and confidence of the afghan people
7418491 the bus service across the line of control loc has been suspended as of today monday but is likely to be operational on its next scheduled date after a fortnight
7418492 although defendant has a system to deliver voicemail faxes and video into outlook inboxes none has been produced there are few emails from some custodians and email boxes are missing from alternative email boxes plaintiffs also contend that many relevant emails and documents were not identified and produced because defendant performed an unreasonable key word search
7418493 seroquels generic name the case involves a slew of cases over the anti psychotic drug seroquel acronyms for diabetes hyperglycaemia spelled the british way and endocrine the search method apparently failed to include common misspellings or the singular forms of words and failed to make allowance for spaces or dashes
7418494 the key word search was plainly inadequate while key word searching is a recognized method to winnow relevant documents from large repositories use of this technique must be a cooperative and informed process rather than working with plaintiffs from the outset to reach agreement on appropriate and comprehensive search terms and methods defendant undertook the task in secret
7418495 many of the other technical problems identified by mr martin and mr jaffe e discovery specialists for the plaintiff likely could have been resolved far sooner and less expensively had defendant cooperated by fostering consultation between the technical staffs responsible for production instead defendant shielded its third party technical contractor from all contact with plaintiffs this approach is antithetical to the sedona principles and is not an indicium of good faith
7418496 the court finds that defendant has been purposely sluggish in making effective production to plaintiffs it is undisputed that the completed production had load file metadata page break and key word search problems making the 10 million pages of documents unaccessible unsearchable and unusable as contemplated under the rules

7418534 in todays business environment data volumes are too large timelines too short and ediscovery requirements too complex not to have an automated review and analysis solution with sophisticated early case assessment whats more recent case law like victor stanley highlights the need for the legal industrys best conceptual search functionality which is represented in axcelerate ediscovery to be an integral part of any document review process
7418535 we worked closely with key customers like fulbright amp jaworski to expand the functionality of axcelerate ediscovery building out the specific features that will enable them to manage their entire review process far more effectively the result is an even more powerful eca review and analysis system that gives our customers and their clients a significant advantage over their competition
7418536 we continued to step up effort to develop innovative businesses in traditional fixed line services we used high quality and bundled services reformed pricing mechanisms and improved customer experience to promote customer loyalty as a result the company achieved good results in its strategic transformation into a broadband communications and multimedia service provider
7418537 we believe that revenue contribution from the broadband content and application services and arpu from broadband subscribers will both increase as broadband content and applications become ever more enriched and their penetration among the subscribers rises
7418538 in the second half of 2008 we will increase investment in our innovative businesses and step up effort to develop the innovative businesses including the broadband services
7418539 we want to fix that statistic were concerned about it the message here is crystal clear and that is children need to be in school
7418540 thats a high priority and were reinforcing it through the legislation
7418541 it is critical that we trial this measure that we look at whether or not it does in fact make sure that parents do the right thing and get their children enrolled at school and attending on a regular basis
7418542 i picked a couple of new ideas lets hope i can now surf ha ha
7418543 content is very useful and great to have a local product

7418547 initial tests have shown that network load could be reduced by a factor of five or more without compromising network performance
7418548 at the same time speeds are increased by about 20 percent
7418549 we think we have one of the most extensible rigorous architectures for making these applications run more efficiently
7418550 americans today spend almost as much on bandwidth the capacity to move information as we do on energy
7418551 thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges
7418552 maybe that labyrinth held clues to another client or another rogue state
7418553 and were not going to rest until you are stopped
7418554 what message does that send when you try to recruit other informants
7418555 detailed construction plans for nuclear weapons for gas ultracentrifuges for the enrichment of weapons grade uranium as well as for guided missile delivery systems
7418556 under all circumstances this information was not to reach the hands of a terrorist organization or an unauthorized state
7418557 we could have respected the treaty by avoiding their publication and putting them under lock and key
7418558 if they had kept the material in federal possession for years why not keep holding it
7418559 the newspapers know more about these things than i do
7418560 no answers to the really interesting questions in this case
7418561 the brits were much more cautious in terms of interpreting intelligence which made it very very worthwhile for me because i had inherited a shop which had decided that we were going to war basically when the bush administration came in
7418562 an attempt to try as it were id say to defuse the whole situation
7418563 and then worry when america wants to sort them out
7418564 it is probably the case that by using methods such as extraordinary rendition deep interrogation indefinite detention and targeted killing that the us has lost more and her allies with her than we have gained in short term relief from terrorist attacks
7418565 is vitally important for all of us in confronting terror that we attempt to climb onto the moral high ground
7418566 we conned the british our closest ally about sabri so they couldnt place in proper context the incredibly valuable channel theyd set up with habbush
7418567 undermined americas moral standing on a mission it now so desperately needs to lead

7418581 youth without youth as in many of these films the only real emotion that comes across is great gusts of sadness and regret
7418582 and look at him walking through the door hes sad because his girl just left him
7418583 the reality of life speaks to us in the silence
7418584 i think now in my heart of the people who are close to me and especially the fans who came to china to cheer for me at the olympics
7418585 those things gave me the power to get the gold medal

7418589 the best thing they could do was play great volleyball they cant control what had happened and probably are going to try to comprehend the magnitude of that event later but what we can do is try to play the best we can
7418590 i thought that was a real good way for them to deal with it im very proud of their approach and their maturity
7418591 at some point in time in all our careers were going to win our last golf tournament and when you win it you obviously dont think thats going to be your last one
7418592 when i won this tournament in 06 i thought i was just going to light it up
7418593 i tackled tom about as well as usc tackled vince young
7418594 its a good way to do that and to communicate all fall
7418595 its a good way to keep the camaraderie when we were friends because we all went to high school together
7418596 ladanian tomlinson adrian peterson steven jackson brian westbrook tom brady
7418597 i was one of those i think it was the fifth or sixth pick and all the good running backs were gone
7418598 i had julius jones last year who carried some yards but he didnt get the touchdowns because theyd always give it to marion barber
7418599 so this year i thought well ill pick marion barber instead of julius jones
7418600 last year i had terrell owens and randy moss and i was doing really well i was the number one seed going into the playoffs
7418601 and some guy that i played had adrian peterson from the vikings and that totally screwed me up
7418602 i just pick who did good last year and thats how it goes
7418603 with the technology that we have now you basically let the computer do the work for you
7418604 china has been systematically targeting every single available medal and were going to have to do that in the future
7418605 the resources that they put toward their olympic team and the population base and the dedication is fantastic
7418606 they have a lot more to spend now and they like spending it on sports
7418607 team sports are extremely popular in america and because of our culture its where we place our emphasis
7418608 but its far easier and less expensive to train one individual than it is 30 or 18 in a team sport

7418631 restrict oversized bags for daytime only as they look cool and chic but to make a statement carry a clutch in the evening
7418632 clutches in gold silver and metallic hues with little embroidery can go with any outfit but it is the neutral bling like dull gold and silver that stands apart
7418633 fashion for me is more about fusion my bags have an indian feel to them as i render them in a more traditional and contemporary manner
7418634 for my bags i use all sorts of woven fabrics like patola and kashid and have fused this with leather to give it a contemporary look
7418635 oversized detailed stitching sleek outer pockets print and textured fabric bags are very much in this season
7418636 most of our bags are accessorized with buckles rings buttons and studs
7418637 bright colours like red black cobalt fuchsia and orange are in but purple simply stands out
7418638 we use italian leather and sometimes nylon for our bags they enhance the durability and longevity of our products
7418639 there has been a steady increase in sari sales over the past few years the sari will never go out of fashion
7418640 the sari is here to stay from teenage girls to women in their mid 60s they all look graceful in it
7418641 it can be attributed to the versatile way in which the sari can be draped to accentuate the form of the wearer coupled with corsets off shoulder blouses and drawstring cholis that make it a whole generation younger
7418642 they said the problem was the boys were playing differently against her because she was a girl
7418643 theyd been taught to not push a girl so they werent fouling her hard and the focus had shifted from playing basketball to noticing a girl was on the floor with them
7418644 you just feel your way as you go she started playing with a local team just once or twice a week then began with the travel team and after that it just builds on up
7418645 i dont think anybodys saying honey how do we screw them up tomorrow but the attention judgment and objectivity that parents bring to their work lives and other spheres of importance they dont bring to their kids sports

7418659 the young men who come in from outer suburbs to drink alcohol and assault gay people are not going to be deterred by a sticker in a window
7418660 because they already have homophobic and violent tendencies its more likely to be a provocation
7418661 lots of people in the gay and lesbian community fear it will provoke more violence weve had enough of these pr stunts
7418662 if people get away with homophobic abuse there is a strong risk that they move on to physical abuse and violence
7418663 we must stop it before it gets to that stage
7418664 the patriot act is huge and i remember someone asking a justice department official how did they write such a large statute so quickly and of course the answer was that it has been sitting in the drawers of the justice department for the last 20 years waiting for the event where they would pull it out

7418675 a diesel locomotive has been sent to the area to pull one train out of the section our technicians have been dispatched to attend to the problem
7418676 we are also waiting to hear from ascension island st helena island and rio de janeiro to find out whether they have experienced similar circumstances
7418677 no one has been injured or killed we have not been informed of any major damage but we believe that what was experienced on the west coast on thursday was a mini tsunami

7418681 but highly desirable the greatest drug cartel the world has ever seen before my own modest enterprise was run of course by your british empire they fought two opium wars with china to retain their trafficking monopoly and twice they defeated them by the treaty of nanjing in 1842 they stole hong kong and opened five new ports to the opium trade turning millions of chinese into gibbering addicts its not unreasonable that someone should attempt to repay them in their own coin is it im doing nothing that the british havent done themselves
7418682 one day bond i will make as many heroin addicts in britain as britain made in china one day soon then youll lose your precious status at the un youll lose the cold war too youll become the third world country you deserve to be
7418683 we had been living in mud hut with a bunch of stinky soldiers
7418684 we were ready to get back and get back into a real bed i had a bunch of stories i wanted to write on the campaign
7418685 the vehicle was crawling around at that point and then we struck it its not really a sound a shock wave more than anything you hear this pop blast pop blast basically thats it then you hear the sound of crunching metal when the vehicle rolls over
7418686 basically they knew they had a couple of civilians so first protocol was to get everybody out of the vehicle
7418687 there was gasoline dripping all over me i was searching around for my helmet the soldier had the composure to say get out of the vehicle get out of the vehicle i was hesitant because i didnt have my helmet but he got us out
7418688 basically we climbed out of the gunner hatch and we were exposed pretty much basically in the desert typically what happens in these ied strikes is that it hits one of the cars itll pop and as the soldiers get out of the vehicle theyll taliban start hitting the soldiers with mortars and an ak 47 fire we were kinda worried that it would happen again but it didnt we were able to walk out of it
7418689 i dont think you come into a situation thinking that youre walking into the safest place in the world this isnt child games theyre playing out here its serious stuff
7418690 i was prepared for what it was but you never quite expect that youre going to be stuck in an ied strike inches away from death
7418691 i would say no they are not winning the war i think what youre seeing though is a substantial evolution in the nature of the terrorist threat globally
7418692 theyre becoming much more sophisticated in terms of launching hit and run attacks that look very senstational but in fact do not fundamentally change the balance of security on the ground
7418693 we know weve got our work cut out for us we know that with a potential canadian and american election in the works thetaliban is going to be looking to sensationalize their agenda there
7418694 thats part of the terrorist playbook is to try and intimidate canadians are not going to be intimidated weve got more grit than that
7418695 im really happy to be the winner here in beijing
7418696 this is history for kenya since 1968 weve been trying but we havent ever won a gold medal in the marathon im really happy to make kenyan history
7418697 i think if i can get a good course like berlin i can run two zero four
7418698 maybe next year i can go there and break the world record
7418699 i thought i had a chance at a medal comments dathan ritzenhein
7418700 but i looked at the clock at 5k and we were already out at i think 14 55 i knew if i kept that up that i wouldnt be finishing
7418701 to be able to come here and finish ninth in the olympics is a step for me
7418702 12 weeks ago i wasnt even running on the ground it took everything i had to get into this kind of shape that quickly
7418703 this has been an amazing journey something we have been working hard on for the last eight years
7418704 we have been saying all along that 2008 was going to be the olympics where we were going to make it happen
7418705 got into a lot of trouble at school it was nothing really really bad but nothing good either i just made bad decisions
7418706 the thought of some little kid saying i want to be a decathlete like bryan clay blows my mind its probably one of the most amazing things in the world
7418707 we go to the 110 meter hurdles and get a silver and a bronze who do we have to beat the world recordholder dayron robles
7418708 the 200 meters we get a silver and a bronze who do we have to beat the world recordholder usain bolt one two three in the intermediate hurdles wheres that joy we get one two three and we werent expected to in the 400 wheres that joy a gold medal in the decathlon im proud of this bunch theyve worked hard trained hard and have done an incredible job
7418709 ive been tested four times in china before i even started running these guys took urine tests and blood tests after every event final ive been tested
7418710 ive been tested out of competition so many times i lost track
7418711 ill still train hard and just work hard to stay on top because im on top now and i want to try to stay there as long as i can
7418712 it was very long to sit and watch the 100m go by and knowing i still had a couple days to go but in the end i look at it and say it was a blessing because i felt very fresh in the 200m
7418713 i always talk about the triple t tradition talent and training in our primary schools physicial education is mandatory and we actually start competing from early childhood
7418714 weve put up big screens in the towns and heavily populated areas so everyone can watch everybody has just stopped working to watch the races its a great moment for us
7418715 i thought the best thing to do is just to go there and if i find myself in the front i should just relax and not panic
7418716 i just saw the line and saw the screen and saw that i was going to cross the line before anybody
7418717 my body could not respond i could not kick at all
7418718 i was camping with friends and watched kellys final on tv at the campsite
7418719 i never thought this tv work was something i would do when i retired

7418725 i dont care if you dont believe in god leave me the alone please
7418726 many are very condescending and an equal number of them focus to much on their atheism
7418727 theres nothing about not believing in a deity that is inconsistent with talking about how you dont believe in a deity
7418728 atheism is a religion like not collecting stamps is a hobby
7418729 we wouldnt want to make broad sweeping generalizations and statistical inferences about being condescending that might be say condescending
7418730 atheists are bad people they think more about themselves than you do
7418731 if god is just then he would reward the virtuous man if hes not he would reward one regardless of his actual virtues in which case he would be a god unworthy of worship
7418732 the scientist you see no ones going to help you bubby because there isnt anybody out there to do it
7418733 its so amazing therefore it must be my god who created it
7418734 reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesnt go away
7418735 ur gonna burn in hell unless you accept lord god king messiah black belt bad ass mother ninja hating jesus as your personal saviour
7418736 haha look at those retards wasting there time at church im gonna spend this next hour looking at internet porn im so smart
7418737 if the only way you can accept an assertion is by faith then you are conceding that it cant be taken on its own merits
7418738 my atheism like that of spinoza is true piety towards the universe and denies only gods fashioned by men in their own image to be servants of their human interests
7418739 i help others not because i dont want to go to hell because my higher power wants me to be of service to others
7418740 the most closed minded pig headed ignorant people i know on the other hand are atheists
7418741 people of faith give more to charity than people without faith
7418742 but when it comes down to it theyre ultimately just trying to validate their own beliefs
7418743 you arent ready to commit your lives to either side of the fence
7418744 if you dont choose my beliefs then youre choosing not to choose
7418745 men must have created god otherwise he would not have been killed so easily by me
7418746 i might have done a little more drugs and paid a little less attention
7418747 thats kind of a popular misnomer that somehow its cheaper to do this
7418748 on the contrary its at least as expensive if not more
7418749 were his teeth the result of maybe too much heinz
7418750 this heinz campaign much like the same ones done by doritos converse and dodge only goes to show how hard it is to do great advertising
7418751 its sort of the last taboo which movie stars are gay because everyone sort of knows it but no one talks about it
7418752 no i got sold out sometime during the 90s record companies made the decision that us guys who had been around for a long time and had sold millions of records and were household names just werent as interesting as girls in stretch dresses
7418753 the bottom line is im a songwriter and i want people to hear my songs
7418754 im not saying its right im not suggesting it for anybody else this is just what i did this time to reinvent myself and stay in business sometimes i get sad about it really i still dont think that people should sell their songs for advertising
7418755 part of the deal i made was o k ill do this but im in charge make it look like a john mellencamp video i dont want to see our country as rah rah flag waving lets show the flood lets show the war lets show the whole thing the fact that they rolled a truck out at the end made no difference to me
7418756 about halfway through the record i didnt really know what it was supposed to be about
7418757 i had so many political songs akin to masters of war that kind of stuff but then i recorded a song called ghost towns along the highway and i said thats what this record is about
7418758 thats a very personal song because its not really about a physical place but about the decisions that weve made and the path that weve chosen corporate america has absolutely changed everything bloomington where i live has a beautiful square theres some restaurants but everyone wants to go shopping someplace else so when everything becomes the mc whatever then you lose what i always enjoyed about living where i live
7418759 when people try to write protest songs they get so trite and overstated
7418760 this song was completely fresh i never heard anything like it
7418761 what i know and what i love is garage music
7418762 whenever were messing around thats what the guys in the band all play
7418763 i had gone so far down this folk thing recording with appalachian instruments i wanted to go back to what we know how to do
7418764 at the time i was totally unaware we were making a record
7418765 but then i thought were never going to be able to beat these versions it sounds as if they just walked in and played and for a sound like that youve got to go through hell to get it
7418766 advertisers on that scale have so much power and visibility
7418767 everyone would think of my video as the apple iphone ad
7418768 when people with that much power and money copy you theres not much you can do
7418769 im quoting cultural references that everyone is familiar with i make art that reflects the culture i live in
7418770 it does seem like advertising people are pushing the envelope on this
7418771 theyre being more and more brazen in their borrowing on the one hand they should be mining the art world for inspiration and you would expect them to be referencing works that people are familiar with but more and more they seem to be getting into the territory of blatant rip offs
7418772 copyright law doesnt protect ideas it only protects expression the question is where do you draw the line is the agency being inspired by the idea or did they copy the artists expression
7418773 there was such a close resemblance to my work that it was uncanny
7418774 when i saw the ad i thought it was definitely inspired by my photographs and videos of installations
7418775 but i cant say that was an influence at all spencer is about masses of people and nudity were about representing the functionality of skin sure its hundreds of thousands of bodies but theyre meant to represent one thing skin
7418776 signs that say what you want them to say and not signs that say what someone else wants you to say

7418783 every new medium finds its own way and rules it will be true for this one too
7418784 the situation was carefully assessed by the administration and it was felt that it had become absolutely imperative to take action under law against these channels in larger public interest and for maintenance of public order
7418785 the local channels are doing a good job in reaching the message of the leadership to the people they are depicting the true picture of the events
7418786 not beaming the images of the current situation in kashmir
7418787 the indian channels are time and again showing what is happening in jammu but there is just a passing mention of the incidents taking place in kashmir
7418788 while the channels are taking updates from their reporters on phone they beam the violent images of jammu as if to given an impression that all this violence is taking place in the valley
7418789 summer has come and passed the innocent can never last
7418790 the vj book inspirations and practical advice for live visuals performance

7418828 pike was an oracle greater than that of delphi he was truths minister and priest his victories were those of peace long may his memory live in the hearts of the brethren
7418829 if it has its secrets and mysteries it is certain that something in the ancient initiations was regarded as of immense value by such intellects as herodotus plutarch and cicero the magicians of egypt were able to imitate several of the miracles wrought by moses and the science of the hierophants of the mysteries produced effects that to the initiated seemed mysterious and supernatural
7418830 then also the priest all the profane being removed taking hold of me by the hand brought me to the penetralia of the temple clothed in a new linen garment perhaps inquisitive reader you will very anxiously ask me what was then said and done i would tell you if it could be lawfully told you should know it if it was lawful for you to hear it but both ears and the tongue are guilty of rash curiosity nevertheless i will not keep you in suspense with religious desire nor torment you with long continued anxiety hear therefore but believe what is true i approached to the confines of death and having trod on the threshold of proserpine i returned from it being carried through all the elements at midnight i saw the sun shining with a splendid light and i manifestly drew near to the gods beneath and the gods above and proximately adored them behold i have narrated to you things of which though heard it is nevertheless necessary that you should be ignorant i will therefore only relate that which may be enunciated to the understanding of the profane without a crime

7418838 the reliance of medieval scholars on classical greek texts ensured that this colour scale was perpetuated for centuries in the tenth century ad the monk heracluius still classified all colours as black white and intermediate

7418909 its been estimated that on average a school age child using a disposable lunch generates 67 pounds of waste per school year that equates to 18 760 pounds of lunch waste for just one average size elementary school
7418910 for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another
7418911 and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart
7418912 yes they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarter
7418913 and the lord has sent unto you all his servants the prophets rising early and sending them but you have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear
7418914 wherefore you be witnesses unto yourselves that you are the children of them which killed the prophets
7418915 but the anointing which you have received of him abides in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it has taught you you shall abide in him
7418916 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made you make him twice more the
7418917 speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which god has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth
7418918 unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled
7418919 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me
7418920 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which lives and abides for ever
7418921 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me
7418922 and i will put enmity between you the devil and the woman eve and between your seed and her seed it shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel
7418923 behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they brake although i was an husband unto them saith the lord but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more
7418924 behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall you not know it i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert
7418925 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
7418926 you are our epistle letter written in our hearts known and read of all men forasmuch as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart
7418927 and i will make your seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered
7418928 that in blessing i will bless you abraham and in multiplying i will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore
7418929 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
7418930 blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross
7418931 behold you desire truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part you shall make me to know wisdom
7418932 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth
7418933 wherefore the lord said forasmuch as this people draw near to me with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men
7418934 cast away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will you die o house of israel
7418935 for circumcision verily profits if you keep the law but if you be a breaker of the law your circumcision is made uncircumcision therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge you who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god
7418936 what advantage then has the jew or what profit is there of circumcision much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of god
7418937 peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send i you receive the holy ghost whose soever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins you retain they are retained
7418938 of this mans seed king david has god according to his promise raised unto israel a saviour jesus
7418939 and as i peter began to speak the holy ghost fell on them gentiles as on us jews at the beginning then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy ghost forasmuch then as god gave them gentiles the like gift holy ghost as he did unto us jews who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god
7418940 when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then has god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life
7418941 and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god
7418942 and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourns among you
7418943 and certain jewish men which came down from judaea taught the gentile brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of moses you cannot be saved
7418944 and other sheep i have gentiles which are not of this fold jews them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd
7418945 and he said it is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel i will also give you for a light to the gentiles that you may be my salvation unto the end of the earth
7418946 for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you gentiles no greater burden than these necessary things that you abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if you keep yourselves you shall do well
7418947 well that makes a great cover for the harvesting of human organs doesnt it
7418948 competition is the key to progress provided that self glorification and self aggrandizement is perceived to be the hoped for final product both selfish gain and selfish path complement and reinforce each other to replace competition with collaboration we will have to socialise the masses mindset to view collective glorification and collective aggrandizement as the hoped for final product only then will collaboration be perceived as the method by which progress is best pursued
7418949 saya masuk ke sebuah toko buku terlihat buku ini dan fikiran saya terbayang tentang kapal terbang yang kerap terhempas dan jatuh

7418956 tapi bukan untuk dipertontonkan seperti dulu saya juga masih mendengar muzik tapi lebih senang kepada nasyid atau memuji islam seperti karya karya yusuf islam muzik rock sudah jarang
7418957 nikmat punya agama seindah islam memberi efek luar biasa dalam hati saya
7418958 for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water
7418959 woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter
7418960 how shall i pardon you for this your children have forsaken me and sworn by them that are no gods when i had fed them to the full they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots houses they were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed after his neighbors wife shall i not visit for these things says the lord and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this
7418961 you shall not make unto you any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth you shall not bow down yourself to them nor serve them for i the lord your god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
7418962 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen
7418963 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth
7418964 wherefore remember that you being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of christ
7418965 for so has the lord commanded us jewish apostles saying i have set you to be a light of the gentiles that you should be for salvation unto the ends of the earth
7418966 and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious
7418967 blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross
7418968 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
7418969 your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
7418970 for what nation is there so great who has god so near unto them as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for and what nation is there so great that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which i set before you this day
7418971 jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me
7418972 if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken
7418973 abraham said unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them
7418974 and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written
7418975 forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word
7418976 let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god
7418977 and the burden of the lord shall you mention no more for every mans word shall be his burden for you have perverted the words of the living god of the lord of hosts our god
7418978 woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture says the lord therefore thus says the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doings says the lord
7418979 and the pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy him
7418980 and the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine
7418981 the new covenant is written on your heart part 1
7418982 by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith
7418983 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went
7418984 jesus answered and said unto them you do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god
7418985 then the pharisees went out and held a council against him how they might destroy him
7418986 jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself
7418987 whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of christ has not god he that abides in the doctrine of christ he has both the father and the son if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed for he that bids him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds
7418988 for if he that comes preaches another jesus whom we jewish apostles have not preached or if you receive another spirit which you have not received from us or another gospel which you have not accepted from us you might well bear with him
7418989 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen
7418990 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness
7418991 and the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give you and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it if you therefore will worship me all shall be yours
7418992 these are the statutes and judgments and laws which the lord made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses
7418993 and in controversy they shall stand in judgment and they shall judge it according to my judgments and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies and they shall hallow my sabbaths
7418994 he that loves me not keeps not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me
7418995 and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself
7418996 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
7418997 circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked
7418998 circumcise yourselves to the lord and take away the foreskins of your heart you men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem lest my fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings
7418999 no stranger uncircumcised in heart nor uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary of any stranger that is among the children of israel
7419000 for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law
7419001 as for me behold my covenant is with you and you shall be a father of many nations neither shall your name any more be called abram but your name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made you and i will make you exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of you and kings shall come out of you and i will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after your in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto you and to your seed after you and i will give unto you and to your seed after you the land wherein you are a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god and god said unto abraham you shall keep my covenant therefore you and your seed after you in their generations this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and your seed after you every man child among you shall be circumcised and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of your seed he that is born in your house and he that is bought with your money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant
7419002 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb
7419003 now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he said not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to your seed which is christ
7419004 its very dangerous to form such an opinion when you dont know all the facts
7419005 queremos un empleado penitenciario cuya jerarqu a no s lo est dada por el rango sino tambi n por la capacidad s lo as podremos romper con la estructura verticalizada y militarista que impera en el servicio penitenciario sp desde hace much simos a os
7419006 no queremos renunciar al sue o que nos hemos propuesto
7419007 la cultura institucional las modalidades de trabajo las concepciones sobre la funci n de los agentes y otras cosas que van a llevar mucho tiempo
7419008 ya est en marcha a trav s de cursos tendientes a romper los viejos esquemas
7419009 un aprendizaje dirigido a la profesionalizaci n y jerarquizaci n
7419010 queremos que el empleado pueda armar su propio itinerario y no como ocurre ahora que est sujeto a las necesidades aleatorias de cada unidad hoy los destinos pueden ser cambiados de un d a para otro y eso es riesgoso para el sistema y para el agente
7419011 si un agente prefiere la seguridad penitenciaria tendr cursos sobre condiciones traslados seguridad perimetral requisas si opta por lo administrativo ser formado en contabilidad log stica licitaciones si su opci n es la asistencia recibir formaci n en comunicaci n psicolog a sociolog a resoluci n de conflictos mediaci n cada curso sostenido en un bloque te rico jur dico que contemple el conocimiento de los derechos humanos el derecho constitucional y el derecho penal
7419012 la situaci n es compleja hoy el personal penitenciario tiene que viajar varios kil metros a su lugar de trabajo hacer una tarea delicada y en un mbito que por naturaleza es violento con un r gimen de 24 horas de trabajo por 48 de descanso pero con extremas dificultades de acceso a las licencias y sobrecarga de servicios por la falta de personal todo eso conforma una tradici n institucional que atenta contra el trabajo
7419013 el encierro lleva a que los agentes sean tan presos como los presos
7419014 solo es capaz de liberaci n un oprimido los opresores no son capaces de liberar ni de liberarse
7419015 la mejor manera de asegurar los derechos humanos de los internos es comenzar asegurando los del personal
7419016 esto es pol tica de mediano y largo plazo no un parche
7419017 debe haber conciencia de la diferencia pero tambi n de lo que hay de igual entre ellos hay que hacerle entender a ambas partes que el otro siempre es un otro pero tambi n es uno mismo que el preso se comporte como preso es lo esperable pero preocupa que el personal penitenciario se comporte como preso all hay que robustecer la tica del empleo p blico y tratar de que estos hombres se sientan orgullosos de su funci n
7419018 los agentes suelen ser v ctimas de agresiones pero sobre todo de las invitaciones de los internos a comportarse err neamente
7419019 si es posible integrar un personal con capacidad para no engancharse con esas invitaciones habr un empleado aut nomo y con posibilidad de pensarse a futuro
7419020 muchas veces los agentes dicen los presos tienen derechos y nosotros no lo cierto es que no hay canales por los que puedan elevar planteos desde hace tiempo hay mesas de di logo con los presos pero reci n ahora se est n estableciendo con los agentes es all donde deben poner la palabra para democratizar el espacio ante la imposibilidad jur dica de agremiarse no queremos que estos hombres crean que los derechos humanos protegen a los internos y que ellos s lo lesionan esos derechos ellos tambi n tienen sus derechos
7419021 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time yet
7419022 this is just a transitory period of subdued growth and we will get through the other side and the growth will resume to more normal levels

7419024 quedaron proyectos pendientes de ser tratados o hay necesidad de que algunos temas tengan tratamiento parlamentario
7419025 hoy buena parte de la protesta del campo empieza a percibirse mucho m s politizada de otro modo no se entiende que toda la serie de iniciativas que estamos realizando no sean valoradas
7419026 nadie puede decir que no estamos haciendo nada pero hay una predisposici n a negar todo lo que ofrece el gobierno y correr el arco constantemente
7419027 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7419028 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7419029 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7419030 es la base de la mayor a de los delitos
7419031 si todo lo que tienen para combatir la droga son un auto y tres polic as hagamos algo entre los vecinos porque de lo contrario estamos fritos
7419032 sabe qui n vende la droga qui n la trae y c mo lo hace pareciera que los nicos que no lo saben son quienes tienen la responsabilidad de detener a los traficantes
7419033 en menos de un mes dijo el jefe policial se ver n los resultados estamos tras algunas pistas que fueron aportadas por los propios vecinos
7419034 el crimen de su hija est relacionado con la comercializaci n de drogas
7419035 los mbitos de decisiones pol ticas tomen determinaciones porque hoy en d a es la fuente de delito m s importante
7419036 la mayor parte de los robos que se cometen como los arrebatos o los hurtos de cables son perpetrados por chicos que usan el dinero de lo que venden para comprarla
7419037 los c digos mafiosos que vemos en las grandes ciudades poco a poco los veremos en los pueblos los que venden droga caminan impunemente por las calles matan a nuestros pibes les vuelan la cabeza los da os ser n irreversibles y no quiero esperar el futuro para medirlos
7419038 la gente de drogas peligrosas habla de la complejidad en la tarea de reunir las pruebas ya no alcanza con la prevenci n y con la contenci n es necesario una r pida y dura acci n policial
7419039 existe la percepci n de que se hace poco en materia de acci n contra el flagelo
7419040 tampoco se observan fuertes decisiones pol ticas del estado provincial y nacional para contrarrestar el problema
7419041 es incre ble c mo en pocos a os la droga pas a formar parte de la vida cotidiana de los pueblos
7419042 no se puede encarar con seriedad ninguna tarea cuando en el departamento belgrano hay un solo m vil policial para esa brigada que muchas veces no funciona y apenas tres efectivos policiales tognoli tom el compromiso de avanzar y tendremos que esperar los resultados quedamos en volvernos a reunir dentro de veinte d as para evaluar los cambios

7419054 one of my pet issues is that i dont really care too much whether things are art or arent
7419055 what im interested in i guess is the creativity thats around it you know people that are making things that are inspired by things and doing things and games are a big part of that
7419056 theyre probably a much bigger and more significant part of that than you know the sydney dance company or things that we spend a lot more time debating or investing in and theres a lot more pages in the paper seemingly devoted to critically thinking about dance production for the handful of people who see it than there are for critically thinking and talking about games that are played by hundreds of thousands of people
7419057 ive spent one of the episodes sort of running around and chasing people who have audiences of squillions on the internet from their bedrooms in australia so i went and found yahtzee crowshaw and spoke to him so hes kind of flying the flag for games

7419118 the young men who come in from outer suburbs to drink alcohol and assault gay people are not going to be deterred by a sticker in a window
7419119 because they already have homophobic and violent tendencies its more likely to be a provocation
7419120 lots of people in the gay and lesbian community fear it will provoke more violence weve had enough of these pr stunts
7419121 if people get away with homophobic abuse there is a strong risk that they move on to physical abuse and violence

7419189 we have to find out who these names and lists were sold to and those individuals should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law
7419190 clearly they didnt want this list to send these people holiday cards they wanted this list to force people out of their homes
7419191 if they didnt have someone to sell the list to they wouldnt have a currency for this

7419196 the chinese government continues to give us an endless stream of material to work with and has an incredible tin ear
7419197 behind all of the pomp and glitter an untold number of chinese citizens are now languishing in labour camps prisons or simply missing as a result of these games
7419198 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7419199 the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7419200 people walking on the street are so happy so optimistic about their own tomorrow the athletes are happy about their performance about the competition about everything they see

7419204 you have a young pitcher hes 27 years old and hes trying to pitch hes different than what he was earlier in the season as far as velocity and that type of thing but john maine wants to pitch and wants to gut it out and we have been assured that he cant injure himself any more than he has
7419205 i think if we do that i would think it would be a complete shutdown
7419206 i guess shutting it down is an option but jerry asked me what i wanted to do and i want to pitch
7419207 theres two months left in the season and i hope i can get through it
7419208 the car was superb i was pushing it to the limit there was nothing left out there
7419209 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7419210 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did absolutely nothing right
7419211 with everything that happened this week we never lost faith
7419212 when you see guys doing that you just want to do your best
7419213 we did a hell of a job putting american basketball back where it belongs on top of the world
7419214 kobes probably the best player in the world hes awesome
7419215 but you take kobe out you put carmelo anthony in you put dwyane wade in you put jason kidd in you put in lebron james i can keep going if you want i wish it was only kobe
7419216 it will be tough to put a team like this back together
7419217 im not coaching the team anymore i can sleep at night now
7419218 but we continue to adjust we picked up luis ayala when billy went down and hes been fine but the reality is there are no starting pitchers or closers out there for trades its tough for us to make waiver claims because there are two other teams in our own division looking to block us
7419219 theres not much we can do weve got to fill in from within
7419220 and weve been assured he cant injure himself any further but were in a pennant race here and weve got to do whats best for him and for the team
7419221 were just going to have to find the guy whos hot
7419222 this was painful youre at that time in the 10th inning when youre figuring matchups and all of a sudden youre down two runs because we didnt do a good job of execution so far as keeping balls in the ballpark

7419245 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7419246 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7419247 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7419248 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country

7419251 if he has any grievances the entire judicial system is at his disposal to address them
7419252 when should we step in now by arresting the ideologues or should we wait till it becomes a full blown armed insurgency
7419253 what about freedom of speech will the police now arrest people for their thoughts in fact an act like the csps 2005 makes it dangerous for us to even think since the state can interpret that as an act of sedition or waging war against the state
7419254 if in the name of security you curtail freedom a time will soon come when there wont be any public security at all
7419255 you are welcome to keep such an individual under surveillance call him to the police station or investigate his whereabouts and activities but you cannot arrest him before you have concrete evidence to corroborate your suspicions
7419256 but after participating in a relay fast in december last year mohan rao was picked up and charged under section 8 1 of the andhra pradesh public safety act for allegedly spreading the message of maoism among the youth

7419261 i dont see any problem with gps prescribing it as long as it is carefully managed under the same strict guidelines as it is presently dr gullotta said
7419262 what with city being at such fault for what happened
7419263 we want to make sure people know exactly who sen obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election between barack obama who wants to fundamentally change the way business is done in washington and john mccain who is just more of the same of what we have had over the course of the last eight years
7419264 hes got to be focused simple and clear rather than elegiac this is not a great novel this is a short clear focused discussion unless it is clear and real simple he has failed
7419265 obama certainly hasnt opened up any huge lead over john mccain in a year that should be an easy year for a democratic candidate
7419266 i think the country still wants to know who barack obama is and where he wants to take the country in a more specific direction than he has given
7419267 you cant lose the change mantra but youve got to continue to indict mccain
7419268 the bottom line is do you want four more years when they leave the convention they need to have fairly vetted that and answered that question

7419288 we believe that this is the kind of location where you should get in and out in two hours these are short term spaces
7419289 weve been brought up from conception to think cheap parking is a good idea
7419290 its part of our primitive reptilian cortex we just arent logical about parking
7419291 is there a pricing point by which transit becomes more attractive then driving between higher meters and the price of gas youre there you now have incentivized people to get out of their cars and onto transit
7419292 i think theres going to be a lot of people initially very upset by it
7419293 it sounds good in theory but in reality i think it would deter people from visiting the city
7419294 they dont want to spend a lot of money at meters meters are supposed to be cheap
7419295 we see them coming out to feed the meter all day thats not what parking meters are for theyre for you to come and park for one hour or two hours while youre shopping
7419296 if the city can free up those meters by charging more we are very much in favor of it
7419297 up until now the balance has really been autocentric and part of what were looking at is how to better accommodate transit and walking and cycling

7419339 the most common are hips and shoulders but we also treat a lot of wrists knees and ankles
7419340 with tendon inflammation you have to be very careful to guide the medication to a site close to the tendon without hitting the tendon which could rupture it

7419354 if one bike broke down they would steal another the reason behind killing the owners of these motorbikes was to avoid identification and evade arrest they did not even hesitate to kill people for amounts as meagre as rs 2 500
7419355 the other reason to kill was to get the original papers and keys of the bike which owners invariably keep in the vehicles with the original papers in their possession they knew police would not doubt them and they would get away easily

7419386 we arent saying people love them but i do think what the studies are showing is to watch content they are interested in people will accept and watch pre rolls
7419387 it is proof that audiences are willing to accept pre roll advertising in exchange for the content they want on demand

7419389 skype has proven to be the perfect partner for our new ask the expert lifeline
7419390 with skype weve not only found an interesting and visually compelling way to offer contestants help in the hot seat but weve done it in a really modern way using new technology thats becoming increasingly popular
7419391 most successful game shows have changed and morphed their look over time and i just think it was time for us to do the same thing
7419392 our show was always designed to be the most modern game show on television and the timing was right to take our unique format and look and evolve them into something even more exciting
7419393 we really took a good look at the lifelines we already had and modernized them
7419394 we quickly got rid of 50 50 as it was always the most unpopular lifeline on millionaire then we noted the switch the question was not helping the contestants much by replacing it with ask the expert we were able to create a truly effective lifeline that also looks very modern and different and cool

7419416 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
7419417 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans

7419436 things falling apart is a kind of testing and also a kind of healing we think that the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem but the truth is that things dont really get solved they come together and they fall apart then they come together again and fall apart again its just like that the healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen room for grief for relief for misery for joy

7419442 we wanted to have the option of security of tenure we also wanted mike to get the setting right for us as we got into the storm
7419443 we believe weve probably passed through the eye of the storm
7419444 weve had that continuity and weve now come to an agreement with mike that he step down
7419445 i cant say that the markets are turning very quickly but were prepared for the environment were in

7419482 after i shook their coachs hand it was all just a little too much for me and it started to sink in
7419483 ive tried to compartmentalize so much of my emotion the last couple of weeks but then all the filters kind of came down i was able to get out there in the hallway take some deep breaths and collect my emotions my thoughts and come back in
7419484 there are so many other lives invested in this project than just my own
7419485 so when i had to take some time off i knew it wasnt helping the team and when i came back i had to be able to be 100 percent invested in what were doing
7419486 these are the best of times and the worst of times
7419487 youre talking about an act with no motive who knows why this guy did what he did so if i spend time getting angry its not really going to help me heal
7419488 its not going to allow me to support my wife or my family and to get through the grieving process if we sit around being angry at something thats already happened its a waste of a lot of emotion
7419489 a couple of them said the best thing they can do was to play great volleyball
7419490 they couldnt control what had happened but they could try to play the best they could
7419491 on one hand im mourning my father in law my heart aches for my wife because of the loss
7419492 on the other hand im extremely proud of my team those are the two emotions i have theyre a little conflicted obviously i cannot change whats happened i can just embrace what has occurred and ill deal with the rest as i go along
7419493 she was ecstatic she screamed into the phone you won you won you won and then there was nothing left to say we were just kind of listening to each other smile on the phone
7419494 im really really sorry for what happened to your family
7419495 the only word for all this is surreal its all a bit fresh to really assign any meaning to it therell be time for that down the road i just know im really proud of my team proud to bring a gold medal home and be an olympic champion

7419503 first successful attempt to show how organic molecules might have been produced on the early earth
7419504 when modern scientists changed the experimental conditions to reflect better knowledge of the earths early atmosphere they were able to produce most of the same building blocks
7419505 everything about the origin of life on earth is a mystery and it seems the more that is known the more acute the puzzles get
7419506 researchers are linking these cambrian groups using not only fossils but also data from developmental biology
7419507 pattern of macroevolution that is change from the form of a common ancestor is called morphological divergence homology is a similarity in one or more body parts in different organisms that share a common ancestor homologous structures provide very strong evidence of morphological divergence
7419508 similarity in characteristics resulting from common ancestry is known as homology and such anatomical signs of evolution are called homologous structures comparative anatomy is consistent with all other evidence in testifying to evolution
7419509 homology many organisms exhibit organs that are similar in structure to those in a recent common ancestor this is evidence of evolutionary relatedness
7419510 structures with different appearances and functions that all derived from the same body part in a common ancestor
7419511 internally similar structures are called homologous structures meaning that they have the same evolutionary origin despite possible differences in function studies of comparative anatomy have long been used to determine the relationships among organisms on the grounds that the more similar the internal structures of two species the more closely related the species must be that is the more recently they must have diverged from a common ancestor
7419512 common ancestry is inferred based on many sources of evidence
7419513 clarification of the phylogenetic i e evolutionary relationships of the major animal phyla has been an elusive problem with analyses based on different genes and even different analyses based on the same genes yielding a diversity of phylogenetic trees
7419514 the more recently species shared a common ancestor the more similar their embryological development
7419515 are radically different in such fundamental properties as egg size fertilization mechanisms cleavage patterns and gastrulation movements
7419516 the more recently species shared a common ancestor the more similar their embryological development
7419517 we do i think have the right to be both astonished and ashamed by the century of mindless recycling that has led to the persistence of these drawings in a large number if not a majority of modern textbooks
7419518 wellss claim that supposed ancestors are younger than archaeopteryx is false
7419519 the intervals of time that separate fossils are so huge that we cannot say anything definite about their possible connection through ancestry and descent
7419520 wellss claim that supposed ancestors are younger than archaeopteryx is false
7419521 there is little persuasive evidence to support this explanation at the present time
7419522 alone invalidates kettlewells experiments as moths were released by placing them directly onto tree trunks

7419524 it might take only between 12 and 20 droughts to change one species of finch into another

7419532 there is no encompassing theory of human evolution alas there never really has been
7419533 scientists have been trying to arrive at a consensus about modern human origins for more than a century why havent they been successful

7419535 a completely human invention created after the fact shaped to accord with human prejudices
7419536 evolution is not directed toward a final goal or state
7419537 humans represent just one tiny largely fortuitous and late arising twig on the enormously arborescent bush of life

7419539 darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist
7419540 i view all beings not as special creations but as the lineal descendants of some few beings
7419541 descent with modification from common ancestors is a scientific fact that is a hypothesis so well supported by evidence that we take it to be true the theory of evolution on the other hand is a complex body of statements well supported but still incomplete about the causes of evolution
7419542 the concept of evolution actually has two faces one fact one theory if we ask how all the organisms on earth have reached their present forms the answer is that they have evolved this answer is based on such an enormous coherent body of evidence that we must take it as a fact by contrast the other face of evolution the complex body of ideas about how evolution occurs is a theory
7419543 modern organisms descended with modification from pre existing life forms
7419544 virtually all biologists consider evolution to be a fact although debates still rage over the mechanisms of evolutionary change exceedingly few biologists dispute that evolution occurs why because an overwhelming body of evidence permits no other conclusion
7419545 over the course of human history two approaches have been taken to the study of life and other natural phenomena the first assumes that some events happen through the intervention of supernatural forces in contrast science adheres to the principle of natural causality all events can be traced to natural causes
7419546 by coupling undirected purposeless variation to the blind uncaring process of natural selection darwin made theological or spiritual explanations of the life processes superfluous

7419601 it should be both and and we should push as hard as we can on both fronts
7419602 i have no doubt that bad schools significantly contribute to lower student achievement
7419603 why do we want to let schools off the hook
7419604 theres nothing in the manifesto that provides enough concrete detail
7419605 a lot of this will get fleshed out in the reauthorization of nclb
7419606 the potential effectiveness of nclb has been seriously undermined by its acceptance of the popular assumptions that bad schools are the major reason for low achievement and that an academic program revolving around standards testing teacher training and accountability can in and of itself offset the full impact of low socioeconomic status on achievement
7419607 we will not surrender one inch on the issue of reforming schools and having an accountability system
7419608 im not sure that other people have spelled out their full accountability system either
7419609 take immediate steps to create accountability for educational success at every level at the system and school level for teachers and principals and for central office administrators
7419610 difficult to understand because the companys share price had slid from about 1 90 in mid june when it was announced
7419611 rocs operational and financial results for the half year have been somewhat overshadowed by the decline in the companys share price since the announcement of the proposed anzon takeover mr clement said
7419612 if successful roc will more than double its 2p reserves and increase its forecast production in 2010 to over 20 000 boepd barrels of oil equivalent per day
7419613 the takeover will immediately increase operating cash flow for the company by up to 50 and expose roc to significant upside reserves potential from the development of the basker manta gummy project in bass strait over the next 18 months structures and career paths shift

7419627 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
7419628 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine

7419642 the big daddy of them all the nerve center of this twisted college football blogsphere
7419643 whats so offensive about our show you tell me offensive is in the eye of the beholder what im trying to do is give funny women a forum to be as out there as they want to be say whats really on their minds and do material thats hysterical but might be considered too edgy for regular comedy clubs
7419644 there are countless ways to make someone laugh and betsy salkind knows most of them want sarcastic wit political humor or maybe just a good animal mime salkind can pull all that off and more
7419645 i think its very difficult to tell people you cant have a brown lawn but dont put a green one in if its artificial

7419653 but nothing will replace the old mceneaney that field had an atmosphere of its own that made it a tough place to play
7419654 we didnt really mind the old field because we were used to it
7419655 we needed to do something just to run a regular business around here
7419656 you couldnt grow grass on it and you couldnt get rid of it well we finally got rid of it
7419657 it was robbing our younger kids of an area to use
7419658 the soccer teams couldnt play out here because it was so bad and the visitors seating for football was a problem we just had bleachers sitting on dirt they werent up in the air where you could see even on the home side people would put down blankets and fight each other for seats it was time for a change
7419659 wed like to have it as soon as we could if its feasible financially
7419660 a lot of money has to be raised privately and schools need to justify the cost by how many times they use it for us its kind of on hold right now
7419661 we thought maybe we could piggyback in with ogorman harrisburg and augustana but it never got beyond the planning stage

7419692 what if you donate your body but do not have a service
7419693 my mother donated her body in 1992 and had to be embalmed in a certain way and that cost us 800 and took 4 years for her ashes to be returned
7419694 i am conscious of such and such a development i am conscious that i am doing the right thing
7419695 reaching out to others sharing individual consciousness with others displacing old worn out and untruthful beliefs with others
7419696 how can we get away from them if mass consciousness is stuck in lower vibrations lower frequencies and lower forms of consciousness
7419697 i see what is in front of me because i know it is there therefore i believe it is there
7419698 and then god said then i said then he said

7419704 childhood is a crucial time when bodies are growing and brains are developing its so important to fuel the body with good nutrition and teaching children smart eating habits at a young age is a great idea it starts with the parents serving as the role model
7419705 when children consume a high fat high sugar meal their bodies will crash and they will become very tired and lethargic which is not going to help them perform at their best level in school
7419706 the whole kennedy family will be in a special section it should be quite a moment

7419709 its humbling we handle compost things spill theres a lot of running
7419710 these are people i would never ever ever talk to even in a social situation
7419711 but you have to go up to them and ask do you want chicken or the vegetarian option and when you start talking to them that way when youre getting them their coffee and their dessert a natural sort of conversation starts happening
7419712 tonight we have braised pork tenderloin with apple bourbon sauce and for the vegetarian entree we have spinach and wild mushroom struedel

7419717 if the u s dollar is rising commodities take a hit its been a huge factor
7419718 we may see this rally in the u s dollar continue in the short term but you have to differentiate between speculation and the underlying demand for commodities
7419719 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up

7419726 we are in mutual agreement then the time is long over for us to be holding peoples hands and repetitively answering the same questions about the same issues its time for people to use their own intuition and break the cycle of co dependency we are declaring war on ignorance everyone has the tools they just dont remember to use them
7419727 there is a valley where that which is spiritual stands on one side
7419728 we did exactly as mother instructed and didnt ask any questions
7419729 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned

7419760 la mera diversidad que descubrieron los estudiantes sorprendi a todos
7419761 apenas hemos empezado a descubrir el potencial de estos microorganismos nuestros estudiantes nos han dado un vistazo del tesoro que albergan estos h bitats y tenemos que actuar r pidamente para preservarlos

7419763 mahasiswa adalah pelapis kepimpinan negara kampus penting sebagai pentas awal menceburi politik
7419764 penglibatan mahasiswa bukan sekadar sebagai pengundi mereka sepatutnya diberikan peluang membincangkan masalah masalah negara dengan kritikal pendekatan ini akan memberi kredit kepada mahasiswa sendiri
7419765 setakat ini unimap bersih daripada sebarang rekod buruk sepanjang saya menjadi naib canselor selama enam tahun dan mereka faham hasrat universiti untuk melahirkan jurutera berkaliber dan serba boleh
7419766 mereka harus terlibat dalam polisi dan dasar kalau orang kurang upaya oku boleh ada wakil dalam dewan negara kenapa mahasiswa tidak dibenarkan penglibatan mahasiswa akan menjadi suara ketiga antara parti parti kerajaan dan pembangkang
7419767 sokong negeri pakatan patut bermula setuju tetapi bukan politik kepartian
7419768 mahasiswa patut jangan terlibat langsung dengan politik kepartian penglibatan dalam politik harus melampaui kepartian mahasiswa mempunyai idealisme sendiri tentang isu isu nasional mereka ada politik sendiri
7419769 tidak boleh ada campur tangan parti politik dalam universiti kalau mahasiswa mahu memihak itu hak seseorang siswa tetapi universiti tidak boleh menjadi sarang mana mana parti politik
7419770 secara prinsipnya kita sokong tetapi belum dibincangkan lanjut di peringkat pimpinan tertinggi
7419771 wajar dilaksanakan di negeri negeri pakatan sudah ada kuasa mahasiswa sebelum ini mungkin takut terlibat dalam politik
7419772 mereka masih dalam proses penyesuaian mereka masih berjiwa pembangkang belum wujud jiwa kerajaan pemikiran masih di takuk lama
7419773 masalahnya pada auku mereka patut terlibat dalam politik dan melalui ngo terutamanya penglibatan itu dapat memberikan mahasiswa ruang membina nama
7419774 buka ruang debat parti politik ingin masuk ke universiti boleh tetapi bukan untuk berkempen sebaliknya berbincang dan menyuarakan pandangan masing masing ambil pandangan kita bincang debat
7419775 lagi cepat akta itu dipinda lebih baik kerana ia tidak akan memberi peluang kepada pihak pihak tertentu untuk mempolitikkan pindaan itu

7419797 at least some of those who were previously enthusiastic about the founding aims of the eu both social and economic are now expressing unease
7419798 successive decisions have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools
7419799 these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7419800 ignoring this trend within the eu and its impact on people of faith has inevitable political and social consequences not least on levels of support for the project itself
7419801 the prevailing culture and social agenda within the eu would at least appear to be driven by the secular tradition rather than by the christian memory and heritage of the vast majority of member states
7419802 the sunrise aint pretty when you aint been to bed tomorrow is today instead
7419803 our success has been built on key markets such as australia and new zealand where we have been operating for over a decade it is the area with the highest potential for growth and is already the fastest growing region in hcls global network we have been experiencing 80 growth year on year in the asia pacific and australia and new zealand regions and expect this to continue
7419804 i felt empowered by the congregation being there because its not something you do every day
7419805 thank god the tabernacle wasnt touched but you feel violated
7419806 in fact we had to put it together because its so rare that we have to use it
7419807 its as if your home or something very personal to you has been desecrated
7419808 it was uplifting for me lifting me out of my doldrums it was powerful to realize for one moment the sacredness of all that we do
7419809 that unfortunately is the deck weve been dealt its to protect the people and to protect the sanctity of the eucharist
7419810 just so that i could use them again without getting the willies
7419811 we didnt expect wed be quite so much in solidarity with them
7419812 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
7419813 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
7419814 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells
7419815 that enable us to create stem cells of various genetic codes eliminating the risk that a body of a patient would reject transplanted tissues or organs
7419816 bee start taking care of those bills and stop acting like your ass is new one wealthy
