1330000 were really trying to understand what makes the company tick in more detail than what you could get from a phone call
1330001 when he left i was surprised because he was very well respected at the company and we thought very highly of him
1330002 so i called him up and tried to understand what it was that he saw at rsc
1330003 the challenge to the south african commercial and industrial development industry is to see how quickly and effectively they are able to embrace the need for green accreditation
1330004 detailed practical guidance on green building techniques will also be showcased as a key element of the convention using both local and international case studies
1330005 inflation targeting is forward looking what influences the central bank is not what the last number of inflation published was but what is the likely outlook going forward
1330006 recently weve had disappointments with inflation developments in the country emanating initially from higher food and energy prices we are clearly very concerned about this situation
1330007 i dont blame people for complaining that monetary policy is tighter but lets not confuse that with abandoning the inflation targeting framework
1330008 we want firmer assurances that no further jobs will be lost
1330009 governments failure to invest in electricity in the late 1990s
1330010 we want to see the withdrawal of the additional 13 tariff increase and we want to see the tariff structure changed to where smaller consumers dont pay more for electricity than large industrial users
1330011 we are very happy to formally launch our solar and renewables energy practice
1330012 we will serve our clients in contributing to the energy solutions that our world and nation require to address the current energy situation
1330013 the only reasonable explanation of these anomalies is graphite bearing metasediments this certainly upgrades the potential of this project to host unconformity related uranium deposits
1330014 the anomalous uranium contents in cbe 22 are significant when the setting of this project area is considered
1330015 the eagle point deposit is only 7 km sw of the property boundary and the athabasca basin is just 4 km distant we still feel confident that this property has very good potential for a basement hosted deposit
1330016 our exploration work at brudell lake and collins bay has advanced these projects significantly
1330017 both projects display prominent geological features and environments for hosting athabasca basin unconformity type uranium deposits
1330018 when we were evaluating voice monitoring systems empirix proved to be the most capable of addressing our unique business needs
1330019 in addition to the obvious product benefits we get with voicewatch another tremendous advantage to working with the company is its outstanding account management team they are knowledgeable and accessible and have proven to be a true partner in our co development process as we work to increase our market share
1330020 as intervoice uses our voicewatch monitoring system to beef up its network operations center this is yet another example of how we help customers identify and alert call engineers about pressing issues and scale accordingly as companies grow
1330021 we always treat our customers as partners and its clear that intervoice values empirix in that role were looking forward to a successful and long relationship
1330022 it was an honor to convene with my peers and discuss those worthy to be recognized as a recipient of the heineken independent achiever award
1330023 im excited to continue to be associated with this program and am proud to be able to recognize the likes harold lilly andre harrell and joi gilliam who are all truly inspirational figures that have and continue to shape r amp b and soul music
1330024 through the involvement of our selection committee we hope to shine an even greater spotlight on the incredible accomplishments of this years heineken independent achievement award recipients
1330025 red star soul is heinekens way to recognize and celebrate individuals whose on stage and behind the scenes work have long inspired and rewarded soul music lovers all over the world
1330026 we are very pleased with this merger with navstar and feel the business model and technology base that navstar has developed will be exceptionally advantageous to argo navigation and its shareholders we are all excited about our synergies between these two companies and we are certain that we will be a strong player in fleet management asset people tracking and also in navigation sector
1330027 this delivery order represents another major step toward establishing better revenue visibility for tcs
1330028 in the first quarter our funded and unfunded backlog totaled about 225 million which was double that of the previous year with this award total backlog now approximates 450 million
1330029 this very important piece of business also represents the largest tcs delivery order to date
1330030 and is a testament to our proven ability to deliver successful deployable satellite solutions in support of highly versatile and mobile u s military missions the size and scope of this delivery order demonstrates the trust tcs has earned in supporting the unique needs of the us army warfighter
1330031 the u s army is now acquiring tcs swiftlink vsat systems and support services army wide via this delivery order
1330032 this delivery order award coupled with the companys performance on current u s army and marine corps programs confirms our ability to successfully compete on large multi faceted opportunities in the first 22 months of the wwss contract tcs leads the six prime contracting competitors in quantity of delivery orders won we are now positioned second in terms of total measured contract award value since this latest contract brings us to more than 350 million of delivery order awards this was a hotly contested program and an important win to set that stage for other large satcom procurements that are in motion we appreciate the contribution and commitment of our partners who joined us to build this winning team
1330033 we used to have 20 to 30 pcs in each of our computer labs
1330034 upgrading that many pcs every three or four years would cost 24 000 but with ncomputing its just 3 200 and we deliver the exact same user experience now we can upgrade more often and have greatly improved the students perception of university technology resources
1330035 maintaining and supporting that many machines was overwhelming our small it staff
1330036 with ncomputing weve reduced support time by about 80 before ncomputing it would take us two days to perform upgrades in a single lab now we can get the job done in as little as two hours we have also realized some significant and unexpected benefits because the ncomputing devices dont take up any desktop space our students have more room for books and papers and because the devices dont generate heat rooms are cooler and our students are more comfortable
1330037 because ncomputing systems dramatically reduce the cost of deploying and maintaining pcs these institutions can meet that demand without breaking their already tight budgets thats just one reason why more than 10 000 educational institutions in 80 countries have chosen our solution
1330038 ncomputing has provided us substantial savings during some rough budget times
1330039 we are facing massive budget cutbacks at the same time that a lot of our older computers need to be replaced with ncomputing we are buying 75 fewer computers to get the same number of seats without ncomputing we would not have been able to replace the majority of those machines
1330040 running all of our old pcs generated so much heat that our air conditioning was running continuously and the rooms were still extremely uncomfortable
1330041 with ncomputing those rooms are now much much cooler in fact based on that experience our housing department asked us to deploy ncomputing in their facilities to save on electricity costs
1330042 in recent years the number of computers supported by our it staff has grown from 2 000 to 4 800 on four campuses
1330043 our it budget didnt grow at the same pace and our 12 staff members are increasingly stretched we also had a goal of replacing our computers every three years to stay current with technology we needed to find a new approach
1330044 we have 50 stations for computer based testing in our nursing education center in a traditional desktop environment setting up those 50 stations would take a massive amount of time deploying the ncomputing solution took less than 15 minutes per station to set up both the hardware and the software with seven ncomputing devices to one pc our school saved about 50 000 for that installation alone better yet installing a new test or performing maintenance takes us a fraction of the time it used to we are standardizing on ncomputing and will be deploying it to all areas where we have large concentrations of pcs used for office applications and internet browsing well then deploy ncomputing across all of our campuses its a no brainer
1330045 i consider my career an outgrowth of this hobby ive grown up around things that fly my father introduced me to model airplanes and rocketry at a very young age and ive had the aviation bug ever since ive been designing building flying model aircraft since i was 6 years old and ive never seriously considered a career path that didnt involve flight
1330046 we view this attempt as a major stepping stone to breaking the world record and we will be making additional attempts at the endurance distance and altitude records in the future
1330047 the discovery of the rusk zone was a major milestone for lake shore gold and we are very pleased to be launching this new drill program to build on our earlier exploration success thunder creek is a highly prospective target particularly given its close proximity to our timmins west project with the rusk zone expected to be easily accessible from the timmins west shaft currently under development
1330048 i founded ovguide com in 2006 as i saw the need for a destination to help individuals find online video and sites at the time did not provide a viable solution
1330049 we have dedicated the past two years to scouring the web for the best high quality video sites to include in our comprehensive database our dedicated editorial team that categorizes each outlet by genre has also helped our search engine become the most accurate in the industry we are continuing to strive to be the destination for consumers to search and discover online video content and are thrilled with the progress we have made in the industry
1330050 we are honored to participate in omnitures marketing experts series
1330051 we design personas and plan content for our clients sites so they produce increased revenues solutions like omnitures sitecatalyst and discover help clients see those results
1330052 over the past six months we have been keenly aware that in light of the unstable economic climate we have been assigning past due accounts to vwa far more frequently with aging receivables dated 90 days past due as opposed to the usual 120 days we have been working in partnership with vwa for three years and they are an excellent third party collection outsource provider for us on the average we receive approximately an 80 return on the receivables assigned to vwa
1330053 2checkout com has been working with vwa for eight months and to date weve seen substantial recoveries of our bad debt receivables
1330054 we go through a process internally trying to retrieve funds from clients with a negative balance the process involves email phone and mail contact in an effort to recoup the funds owed if we cant collect them in 180 days the receivables are sent to vwa in the past year we have had a significant increase in aging receivables prompting us to work with vwa to recoup funds and improve our liquidity
1330055 when a comparison is made of the second quarter 2008 to the same quarter in 2007 dollars placed for collection with ccaa members rose substantially by approximately 24
1330056 in a contracting economy receivables become a prime concern for many companies as they stumble on roadblocks when it comes to reconciling their outstanding accounts and when that happens keeping a close eye on cash takes center stage working capital is squeezed at both ends as the business looks to negotiate better terms with suppliers and at the same time guard against inevitable customer defaults
1330057 tough economies always result in increased bad debt or the need to cure slow paying customers
1330058 based upon close interaction with clients and the marketplace the increased activity is in line with our expectations we anticipate these levels to continue for both commercial and consumer debt through 2008 the majorities of our clients have begun to tighten their extension of credit and are looking to liquidate their own receivables earlier in the collection cycle to mitigate any potential risk of additional write offs
1330059 medsphere is experiencing widespread customer adoption forming powerful partnerships that expand the capabilities of our technology and hitting our stride in terms of growth
1330060 we want to do everything possible to maintain this momentum the move to san diego county enables medsphere to recruit from a qualified pool of talent and puts us in proximity to potential partners from healthcare and it that are also putting down roots in the region as our 2008 success clearly demonstrates hospitals are recognizing the value of open source in healthcare we look forward to many years of success in our new location
1330061 netqos products are used by many of the largest it organizations in the world to monitor their global enterprise networks where performance and reliability are vital it is important that we have a reliable and accurate portrayal of how our products will work in extremely busy production networks with breakingpoint we get hard data that shows us how well our products are working the requirements for performance testing have shifted dramatically over the past few years and breakingpoint recognized this shift and delivered a product that is not only powerful but extremely easy to use
1330062 speed and accuracy are the cornerstones to valid testing of network equipment without realistic application traffic and the ability to simulate at speeds of 10 gigabits per second you dont have true performance numbers to share with your own customers and prospects netqos monitors the performance of the largest networks in the world and we are delighted that they selected breakingpoint to help test and validate their own solutions in real world conditions and push the performance envelope even further
1330063 intelligence is what you use when you dont know what to do

1330076 i was hoping to reinvigorate the egg cream phenom that existed in the early 1900s maybe every diner and soda shop will have it
1330077 i wanted to reintroduce the egg cream to a whole generation of people
1330078 it s one of those things that s really surprising to me that it never really went anywhere outside of new york
1330079 that is one of the reasons that my grandfather said he never could leave new york because he couldn t find a an egg cream
1330080 when i first opened my store in the west village and i put it on the menu and none of my staff were from new york so they didn t know what an egg cream
1330081 it takes a few moments to marry the three tastes the creaminess and the bubbles and the chocolate
1330082 we were like there are no eggs don t worry
1330083 they kept on calling it an egg cream even though there was no egg it
1330084 not normally but you can still find free credit offes with incentives

1330087 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1330088 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1330089 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1330090 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1330091 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1330092 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign
1330093 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man

1330200 new mothers speak out national survey results highlight womens postpartum experiences
1330201 postpartum mothers experience a troubling burden of physical and emotional health challenges after giving birth although many of these problems abate over time far too many women were still experiencing them from 6 to 18 months after birth with more than 4 3 million births each year in the united states it is an urgent priority to better understand the reason for these challenges their implications for women and their families ways to prevent distress and morbidity and ways to help women and families before they experience detrimental effects
1330202 co sleeping was one of the many areas including breastfeeding pregnancy intention and circumcision rates in which we found postpartum experiences of mothers varying widely by race ethnicity these variations merit further research
1330203 this important new study underscores the urgent need to improve maternity and pregnancy related benefits for women in the united states
1330204 while nearly every other economically competitive nation provides paid maternity leave and stronger supports for working mothers women here struggle to cobble together the time off income and childcare they need this survey shows the toll that is taking on mothers and families we can and must do better
1330205 the overall picture is of recent mothers engaged in a juggling act carrying multiple and sometimes conflicting responsibilities while experiencing high levels of social physical and emotional health challenges there are concerns about whether large segments of this population have access to adequate health and social services and social support we are letting our mothers and babies down at one of the most critical and vulnerable times in their lives these survey results are a clarion call to action for programs policies clinical services and research to better understand and improve the experiences of new mothers and their families

1330217 we cannot stifle speech because we dont want to hear it or we dont want to hear it now
1330218 the social climate right now is that were into a new form of censorship and thought control and the commissions are being used as thought police

1330220 police office sues lapd and los angeles alleging religious discrimination
1330221 the basic view of the church is that homosexual acts are a sin but we love the sinner
1330222 christians are probably the best friends homosexuals have in the world because we want to see them delivered from an addiction that will shorten their lives in this world and condemn them in the next
1330223 i really think this is a crucial case because if an agency of the government which the chrc is can tell a political party what it may and may not include in its political statements we have gone way down the road to totalitarianism
1330224 homosexuality god made them man and woman and saw that it was good
1330225 a court order decreed the removal of the billboards and the cancellation of a public event scheduled by the coalition to further the defense of family values claiming that it was homophobic

1330227 regina griggs the executive director of parents and friends of ex gays said her organization and staff members repeatedly have been attacked simply because of their message that there are such individuals as former homosexuals
1330228 griggs said at the time the gays became infuriated when our ex gay volunteers testified about leaving homosexuality one gay man went so far as to hit our ex gay volunteer because he refused to recant his ex gay testimony
1330229 the fair was one of the events to which pfox was admitted several other major influences in america today including the national education association and the parent teachers association simply refuse to allow pfox to appear at their events
1330230 those who condemn homosexuality also face electronic badgering when sally kern an oklahoma lawmaker vocally rejected the homosexual lifestyle choice as a threat she was inundated with tens of thousands of e mails in a coordinated attack on her beliefs some of the e mails threatened her
1330231 griggs told wnd the movement is becoming more aggressive in teaching that homosexuality is something people are born with not something they choose for whatever reasons
1330232 each year thousands of men and women with same sex attractions make the personal decision to leave homosexuality by means of reparative therapy ex gay ministry or group counseling their choice is one only they can make however there are others who refuse to respect that choice and endeavor to attack the ex gay community consequently ex gays are subject to an increasingly hostile environment where they are reviled or attacked as perpetrators of hate and discrimination simply because they dare to exist griggs said
1330233 the politically correct policy was quietly adopted at schools in the interests of sensitivity over the growing number of lone parent and same sex households
1330234 there is only one acceptable way to talk about homosexuality silence
1330235 legal experts believe that the womans right to medical treatment will trump the doctors religious beliefs one justice suggested that the doctors take up a different line of business
1330236 this decision is a stunning disregard for religious liberty and first amendment freedoms of people of faith of christians and those who believe in traditional marriage defined as one man and one woman this shows the very disconcerting authoritarian face of the homosexual activists who are using these non discrimination laws as weapons against christians in the business world and christians in their churches
1330237 church must learn that denying people jobs on the ground of their sexuality is no longer acceptable
1330238 with anti discrimination ordinances in place theres no way a policeman would arrest a woman for being shirtless because she could say shes not a woman and under the ordinance she gets to determine whether shes female or not
1330239 who would have believed that the colorado state legislature and its governor would have made it fully legal for men to enter and use womens restrooms and locker room facilities without notice or explanation henceforth every woman and little girl will have to fear that a predator bisexual cross dresser or even a homosexual or heterosexual male might walk in and relieve himself in their presence
1330240 we watched as a parade of men dressed as women going into the state house ladies restroom and women into the mens room while inside the hearing the activists were unusually honest about their belief that transgender rights will trump the publics comfort with their behavior
1330241 catholic charities in massachusetts refused to place children with same sex couples as required by massachusetts law after a legislative struggle during which the senate president said he could not support a bill condoning discrimination catholic charities pulled out of the adoption business in 2006
1330242 a same sex couple in california applied to adoption profiles an internet service in arizona that matches adoptive parents with newborns the couples application was denied based on the religious beliefs of the companys owners the couple sued in federal district court in san francisco the two sides settled after the adoption company said it will no longer do business in california
1330243 i was not aware of how serious the problem was of the sexual activity thats taking place in bathrooms and public places and parks in broward county and particularly the city of fort lauderdale ive been educated on that and i want to apologize to the parents and the children of our community for not being aware of the problem this to me is totally unacceptable i dont think that in the name of being inclusive or tolerant any of us in the community should tolerate this

1330452 you take water plus these catalysts and light from the photovoltaic and you make hydrogen and oxygen you store the hydrogen and oxygen then when you combine it back over say a fuel cell you get water back and electricity out so in this sort of design you dont need to worry about where youre going to get the water from except the initial time you get the initial water then youre in a closed loop and its just humming away with light as an input from a photovoltaic youre taking water to hydrogen and oxygen and then hydrogen and oxygen back to water
1330453 once you make that electrode you can take it out and you dont need the cobalt anymore but its good to have the phosphate around and the reason for that is remember when we started it was just a clean piece of glass and then when we put the positive potential on it it oxidizes cobalt it takes it from whats called cobalt 2 to cobalt 3 and the cobalt 3 and the phosphate form this thin film now in the natural cycle of this catalyst working it goes back to cobalt 2 and then it can redissolve but then when the electrodes under a positive potential it goes back to cobalt 3 and then the phosphate in solution will capture it and bring it back to the electrode and so we call that self healing or a repair mechanism so what you can do is make the catalyst out of cobalt and phosphate get your thin film its like a darkish blue black film on the conducting glass take the conducting glass out and put it on a shelf then when youre ready to make o2 you can take that conducting glass put it into a solution of phosphate just phosphate and water now phosphates a mineral anion and then the thing just hums away making o2 and the reason you want that phosphate is because in the natural cycle of the catalyst performance the cobalt can redissolve in solution and then the phosphate escorts it back to the electrode

1330976 missiles were thrown including machetes at australian sailors and the chief of defence phoned me and asked me if they could undertake direct fire and i said yes they most certainly can
1330977 those people who come to australia who want to steal our fish and breach our exclusive economic zone need to know that we are not going to muck about
1330978 the basic feature of secularism is in no way marred by the decision the government is not averse to the idea of granting support to the pilgrimage conducted by any community
1330979 as such the basic feature of secularism is not at all impeded by such activities rather it stimulates the ideas as set out in the preamble to the constitution

1330981 this is a key strategic development for quebecor media since consumer demand for advanced wireless services is expected to increase substantially in the coming years
1330982 once again quebecors very positive results were spearheaded by robust numbers in the cable segment which continued to log strong customer growth for all its services
1330983 at the conclusion of the spectrum auction for advanced wireless services quebecor media held standing high bids on 17 operating licences covering all of quebec and part of the toronto area
1330984 a still more complete and competitive array of cable and telecommunications services
1330985 the process cannot access the file d folder file aspx because it is being used by another process
1330986 that shouldnt be a surprise given that in june the industry appeared to be hitting bottom in many respects and last summer was often described as the summer from hell a period that spawned the passengers bill of rights movement and caused the faa to step in and put a cap on traffic at some of the busiest airports
1330987 if we look at the themes that have been driving the c dollar during the last couple of weeks now number one is that weve seen a fairly substantial weakening in commodity prices especially crude oil
1330988 the market is paying a little more attention to that because the last few corrections in crude oil have been very short term and fairly shallow
1330989 more protracted in terms of time and a lot larger in terms of the magnitude of the corrections
1330990 were starting to see economies in the u k europe and japan for example start to exhibit weakness
1330991 people are beginning to get worried we are going to see reduced demand for commodities which obviously filters back into negative sentiment for the c dollar
1330992 generally we remain bearish on commodity currencies including the cad
1330993 commodity stock liquidation has led to a broad outflow of funds from commodity related equity markets
1330994 the combined effects of the continued pullback in commodity prices alongside further usd gains not unrelated events in themselves has seen some of the g10 commodity linked currencies come under considerable pressure
1330995 since july 21 the cad has fallen 4 1 per cent the kiwi is down 5 0 per cent and the aud is off 6 1 per cent
1330996 lets get ahold of this lets let it sink in and change us lets let the living god take over our lives and show us what it really means to walk in faith
1330997 pits players against each other in a fast paced battle to eliminate the opposing teams tickets
1330998 this development is not entirely a surprise for the u s market
1330999 we believe the commercial is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession we will reach our consumers in the u s primarily through the web site the print campaign and at point of sale we are anticipating a very successful global launch

1331001 you dont care about children you just care about money our studies well its more like an opinion survey but a scientific one show a substantial risk when the substance is injested daily in excess of 500 grams were calling for a consumer boycott
1331002 research has not consistently demonstrated a link between cellular telephone use and cancer or any other adverse health effect
1331003 health canada sees no scientific reason to consider the use of cellphones as unsafe
1331004 is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
1331005 hangzhou court failed to conduct a substantive review of the accuracy and legality of the determination of facts and application of law and rendered its ruling based on a procedural review only

1331017 i dont know if im going to get a chance to lead the football team but youre going to have to pry the ball out of my fingers this year
1331018 how friendly is nancy compared to the rest of us
1331019 we should look for someone to eat and drink with before we look for something to eat and drink
1331020 i wasnt scared at first because there were many other boys there
1331021 but then they told me to take off my clothes
1331022 they told me if i go to the doctor im not a real man
1331023 the ones who attend this year by next year theyre taking the other ones because the school owners promise them money
1331024 they tell them its a nice place that theyre eating nice food and once theyre there they have no chance to run away
1331025 if theyre caught before they see what is going on there they can be turned away but the problem is if theyve gone in and theyve seen something according to custom after youve seen the secret you cant be turned away
1331026 for now there are about eight coming for regular dressings but most of them wont allow a woman to see that area so when they come home they dont tell the mothers theres a problem
1331027 they laugh at them they side line them especially leading up to the initiation season
1331028 my nephew used to go and stay in town with my daughter to avoid it but this year he went to the school he said he was tired of hiding
1331029 i didnt want them to go to the mountain its not safe
1331030 it was cold and he cant stay in the cold
1331031 i tell my people not to go to initiation schools i think its a waste of time in our tradition there are good things and bad things and in my place i discard the bad things
1331032 some are registered but i dont think it means anything in the past year many accidents have happened
1331033 once they have permission they might run six schools in one year which means they cant look after all the boys
1331034 it does happen that some people who run these things see it as a money making scheme
1331035 if somebody goes against the regulations they can be fined in a court of law
1331036 individuals and families are in temporary rental housing or doubling up with relatives or friends
1331037 that this is not a solution either short term or long term state and local government must step in to fill the gap
1331038 luis then went over to jessicas car and tried to break the back window out to get their son jessica says children began to cry and thats when luis stopped and drove away
1331039 are you kidding me 8o kids where are their parents now there is red wine my clothes in place outside morgan whats the word for balcony i dont have the words but i am very angry
1331040 oh how much did that shirt set you back looks like it cost you at least three towels
1331041 just a cut uhh more proffessional less curl not too short on top
1331042 but shes next to a hebrew inscription on stone which has to count for something
1331043 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1331044 for over two years amazon web services has provided infrastructure services that help companies of all sizes from small startups to larger enterprises realize the cost time and scaling efficiencies of cloud computing we believe that cloud computing will continue to grow into a large industry with companies providing a range of different services
1331045 elastra has an experienced team with a unique software approach that helps enterprise companies realize the benefits of cloud computing
1331046 we took a hard look at the value businesses see in cloud computing it was clear that enterprises need a complete and integrated way to manage entire applications in cloud environments we feel elastra has set their sights on the right segment of the market enterprises whose applications need a holistic architected approach to managing cloud based systems rather than libraries of machines that are tied together with random scripts
1331047 elastras management team consists of seasoned professionals with an enterprise software background who have built software companies before we are excited to back this group and support them in bringing their product to an untapped and eager market segment
1331048 enterprises are moving into the cloud and understand its financial value but they need software that lets them deploy and manage applications that meet complex requirements creating this software and doing it right requires a lot of work from many talented people i am happy to rely on the backing of such outstanding investors and market pioneers as elastra delivers the product functionality and robustness our customers demand
1331049 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1331050 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1331051 you can see that the arrears for together are substantially higher than for the standard product
1331052 the chancellor and the government were totally irresponsible for failing to heed my warnings from last october that the bank should be stopped from giving out 125 together mortgages these shocking figures show northern rock has 6 3bn in unsecured loans it was clear even then that they could never be repaid in a falling housing market
1331053 alistair darling assured parliament that taxpayer loans to northern rock would be fully secured on mortgage assets this is clearly not true
1331054 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1331055 gordon brown and alistair darling promised taxpayers the loan to northern rock would be repaid in full but now just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1331056 you need to bear in mind that the eu state aid rules do not allow for a drip feed of capital into the bank we have selected an amount that we believe is comfortable for the whole period of temporary public ownership
1331057 at first men think we hook up a robot and then go get some coffee but the reality is the robot arms are a tool that i control just like a scalpel
1331058 im able to spare all the things that help men have their dignity and at the same time take away the cancer
1331059 but to say weve seen a quantum leap in regards of one treatment being better than the other is premature
1331060 whats driving the increase is truly the consumer patients are requesting it like never before
1331061 the fact that less blood is lost and a short hospital stay is appealing for some patients
1331062 i freaked out a bit got on the internet and called around to find out what was out there for me
1331063 i do a lot of exercise i wanted to be back on my feet as quick as possible
1331064 i was amazed at what little pain i had i was at home and even walked my dog the very next day
1331065 its important to talk to your doctor to figure out what is the best way to treat your individual case
1331066 most important thing is for men to get screened and know what treatment options are out there for them
1331067 im delighted to be a part of the volts set up and am looking forward to playing some good cricket for them
1331068 i really feel like i have something to offer with the volts in terms of leadership and experience
1331069 dimitri is a dynamic cricketer with the ability to win a match on his own
1331070 dimitri is clearly excited at the opportunity to play in an experienced and successful team under a management structure that encourages flair
1331071 playing cricket in new zealand is something ive always wanted to do and otago seemed an obvious destination with such a talented playing list who will be looking for success
1331072 we believe its the highest value mssp bundle ever delivered
1331073 we identified all the obstacles that small partners face in delivering an mss private label program and countered them with solutions that we feel demonstrate our key advantages and our willingness to make significant investments in our partners businesses now any small business can have state of the art managed internet security without moving away from their trusted it solutions provider
1331074 2011 is wonderfully suited for this trendsetting idea of offering free digital books
1331075 its a tantalizing prospect for the open source generation and anyone else for that matter
1331076 theres so much product out there from people who arent writers just putting out a book for the hell of it
1331077 the new ebook is my way of showing folks this was written to be read

1331079 with his life and work alexander solzhenitsyn greatly boosted societys immunity to all forms of tyranny
1331080 i came here because in the 1970s i read this one little book that completely changed everything for me when i heard the news yesterday it was a terrible blow for me
1331081 im thankful that i lived to this time so i could be free so my children can be free to some extent this is all thanks to him
1331082 he was not one of those people that everyone loves but he was one of those people whose role in history cannot be exaggerated it is not just significant it is enormous
1331083 broadens our offerings to better support both start up companies who have basic rich media requirements as well as large global organizations
1331084 i wish i could take times and come up with something that nobody else has done but thats gonna take few years
1331085 i asked barack what he wanted for his birthday and he said three things indiana colorado and virginia
1331086 i think that there is a tendency particularly for democrats to start feeling kind of giddy again the poll numbers look pretty good
1331087 you go off on a trip that your opponent has told you you need to take so you take the trip
1331088 and suddenly this trip that you were told you had to take youre acting presumptuous youre acting like a president already

1331098 die olympischen spiele sind f r mich schon etwas ganz spezielles und etwas was ich bedauere nicht mit meiner sportart aus ben zu k nnen weil es bei olympia keine motorsport events gibt das ist etwas was ich unheimlich gern erleben w rde nicht so sehr als zuschauer sondern als sportler zum einen f r deutschland zum anderen das olympische dorf ich kann mir nur vorstellen dass das ein ganz spezielles erlebnis ist
1331099 wenn vielleicht etwas nach meiner karriere was man noch im h heren alter aus ben k nnte ich m chte jetzt keinem zu nahe treten aber ich denke beim schie en zum beispiel ich glaube da muss man nicht unbedingt 18 sein also wenn ich es gemacht habe dann hat es immer gut funktioniert aber ich glaube es war noch nicht ganz olympia niveau
1331100 was ich fr her gern gemacht habe ist basketball aber das f llt ja schon einmal aufgrund meiner gr e flach lacht aber das w re f r mich auch nicht das entscheidende gewesen in welcher sportart sondern einfach nur mal dabei zu sein

1331105 this is with out a doubt the event of the year
1331106 cancun is a great place for a vacation and a chance to hang out with all the tig people
1331107 i really enjoyed riding in the 24ve during the pro portion of the tournament
1331108 with an experiential approach this site beyond many that we saw excelled at presenting a boating lifestyle
1331109 this site surpassed the others with the addition of engaging imagery concise well written copy and a not too heavy handed approach to the interface
1331110 our intention was to create a website that communicates how the high quality and innovative features of our boats enhance the on water lifestyle of our customers
1331111 were all honored that such a prestigious organization and panel of judges feel we have succeeded
1331112 when we went there we found an astonishing amount of gorillas
1331113 this is the highest known density of gorillas thats ever been found

1331133 for insights to be useful they need to be generated from within not given to individuals as conclusions this is true for several reasons first people will experience the adrenaline like rush of insight only if they go through the process of making connections themselves the moment of insight is well known to be a positive and energizing experience this rush of energy may be central to facilitating change it helps fight against the internal and external forces trying to keep change from occurring including the fear response of the amygdala
1331134 when people solve a problem themselves the brain releases a rush of neurotransmitters like adrenaline this phenomenon provides a scientific basis for some of the practices of leadership coaching rather than lecturing and providing solutions effective coaches ask pertinent questions and support their clients in working out solutions on their own
1331135 attention continually reshapes the patterns of the brain among the implications people who practice a specialty every day literally think differently through different sets of connections than do people who dont practice the specialty in business professionals in different functions finance operations legal research and development marketing design and human resources have physiological differences that prevent them from seeing the world the same way

1331171 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1331172 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1331173 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the
1331174 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1331175 having studied in detail the programmes of real madrid and the dutch eleven i realised that given the physical effort required to perform at my maximum i was going to have to make a choice
1331176 the combination of the competition cup and champions league games of real madrid and the programme of the dutch team is too heavy a burden
1331177 obviously such a decision is not something one takes in a night i have experienced a great euro 2008 with the orange team and i look back on it with fondness
1331178 of course i find it a pity that i wont be able to call on his quality and international experience in putting teams together in the future
1331179 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
1331180 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1331181 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1331182 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1331183 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning
1331184 he has magic and is capable of anything on a football pitch
1331185 his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1331186 the first rule for winning football is to make sure we play well but for all that well try to play good exciting football our opponents are always going to be trying to stop us from doing that
1331187 sometimes the games wont be as spectacular as wed like thats just the way it is but this team has players with great quality who can play high calibre football
1331188 its the responsibility of all the players to play exciting football but im more than happy to assume that role ill take on the role of making the football exciting very happily
1331189 ive asked the minister of health to promise me that the people the government the parliament will get together and realise that they do have a problem on mykonos when it comes to hospitals
1331190 you have thousands of people going to these islands and these tourists need to know that if they get into trouble that they can get the medical care
1331191 mr zammit is leaving greece leaving behind four people who are siblings of his son
1331192 his generousity is a lesson the greek state honours his important gesture and assures him that his sons legacy will not go to waste
1331193 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1331194 initial analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1331195 i still have plenty of tournaments to do well in and i hope i can start here at the olympics and fulfil my dream to win gold
1331196 i only arrived on monday and ive got jet lag but im more tired than normal
1331197 im 80 percent sure my coach hasnt really told me
1331198 its the first miscommunication ive had with my coach i hope it doesnt happen again
1331199 im confident the air quality will not pose major problems to the athletes
1331200 all the people said taufik you are crazy like you are just coming out of hospital and the next day you are training but i say im okay although i only had one week for training
1331201 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1331202 to ensure that its judgment has its intended effect of guiding the political branches to a constitutionally permissible method of complying with the nations treaty obligations
1331203 executing jose medellin in violation of an order by the world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law
1331204 if the united states ignores its legal obligations in this case it will be tough to argue that other countries should respect the rights of us citizens

1331220 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1331221 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1331222 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten into extinction
1331223 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1331224 fernando is one of the top drivers in formula one and i think every team apart from one would welcome him
1331225 we are no different but whether it happens who knows
1331226 i think any team would want to have a longer term deal any driver for one year is difficult
1331227 but if you have one year deal well then it becomes two or three years
1331228 i am sure the mclaren deal was more than a one year deal and that didnt last beyond a year
1331229 it was an innocent list it had nothing to do with any animosity he held toward st johns
1331230 right now we dont know his intentions but we are continuing to investigate that
1331231 the allegation right now is that it was a simple argument
1331232 theres a lot of information that we cant reveal right now
1331233 but the bottom line is it was an argument that led to the taking of the lives of three people

1331254 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1331255 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles
1331256 if we can design particles that rely on the same mechanisms that nature has perfected for bacteria we may unlock the key for delivering therapeutics more efficiently and effectively to treat and cure disease
1331257 we are delighted to contribute to the important work that professor desimone and his students are undertaking in the field of nanomedicine this work answers key questions about the role of particle shape and size that industry leaders have been asking for some time

1331278 he wasnt afraid to speak his mind he was an example for us all
1331279 one of the greatest thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century
1331280 he was not one of those people that everyone loves but he was one of those people whose role in history cannot be exaggerated it is not just significant it is enormous

1331283 i am extremely honored and nervous to finally meet my idol
1331284 is there anyone who hasnt been a fan of seo taiji at one point or another do you know anyone like that
1331285 i was a huge fan and he was a great inspiration

1331287 our grounds are worse than the portuguese 3rd division teams
1331288 in those days and in that time saith the lord the iniquity of israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of judah and they shall not be found for i will pardon them whom i reserve
1331289 well lets look among those where sin will be least likely to be found and perhaps not so blatant and repulsive
1331290 well if we look among the right group maybe we wont find anything noteworthy and we could say that we really didnt find any sins
1331291 to look for something diligently to seek to uncover to dig up
1331292 oh you are those who call upon the holy god you believe in the just god you believe that god hates sin you claim to be his child let me tell you a little bit about yourself
1331293 well there were no sins and there were no iniquities to be laid to our account
1331294 i will pardon i will forgive i will send away their sins i will pardon by actually removing them so that they no longer exist so they no longer deserve punishment so that they no longer appear before my eyes calling out for judgment
1331295 well we will simply forget all about it since you are sorry for your sins i have decided to let bygones be bygones and i will simply forget about it
1331296 i take away your sins by actually taking away the punishment that those sins deserve
1331297 search look all over satan you may search world you may look conscience of a believer you look look for sin and iniquity unpardoned unforgiven sin see if you can find one unpardoned sin among my children you cannot because there is none
1331298 perhaps some of my good deeds can take away my sins
1331299 well im sorry for the past and i hope that god will be merciful
1331300 i will pardon those whom i leave as a remnant

1331336 no matter how smart only have limited amounts of information they also like all of us have biases its very rare that one person can know more than a large group of people and almost never does that same person know more about a whole series of questions the other problem in finding an expert is that its actually hard to identify true experts in fact if a group is smart enough to find a real expert its more than smart enough not to need one

1331398 when simon amp schuster sent me an advance copy of s new book earlier this month i was delighted the media columnist for the new york times would surely be delivering a terrific account of his career how he got the job and his take on big media new and old the moguls and prima donnas the tycoons and talents the working journalists and the media conglomerates the sycophants and pr people and hustlers the publishers and editors the magazine empires and the networks the talk show hosts and the radio talkers the deal makers and the takeover artists what a glorious read that would be and what a column or two i could get out of it but as the immortal red barber used to cry exultantly from the press box at ebbets field whoa nellie the night of the gun isnt that book at all it is instead a memoir of carrs drug addiction and recovery

1331403 its disgusting that the bbfc could allow such society destroying filth
1331404 though i am not normally in favour of banning movies i couldnt see how the british board of film classification could with even an appearance of consistency award crash an 18 certificate
1331405 in more civilized times this kind of sad sickening exhibitionism would never have been granted a certificate
1331406 the bbfc interprets the absence of a public outcry against their
1331407 people over 18 have a right to see graphic portrayals of real sex in films and video
1331408 many people seem baffled as to why we are raising a generation of
1331409 why do these people think they can act this way
1331410 this film is not worthy of an 18 certificate for it is not suitable for audiences of 48 and over let alone those aged 18 but it will be seen by millions of people including children on whom it will make an indelible impression
1331411 i asked at the start why violent yobs think they can act this way it is also relevant to inquire who is encouraging their culture of sadism well let me name names one is this films writer director eli roth another is takeshi miike who contributes a cameo performance to hostel a third is roths mentor quentin tarantino who also appears briefly in the film and enabled it to be made and released by being its executive producer serious questions should be asked of mr roth but i would like to know what sony pictures are doing releasing such a picture is making money their only motivation have they no shame no sense of social responsibility no values i would also like to know who apart from our pusillanimous and negligent censors thinks this kind of evil pernicious trash truly warrants an 18 certificate

1331423 the mayor doesnt believe that libraries should be forced to reduce hours and the administration is committed to finding the money to resolve budget issues
1331424 i dont think its necessary and i do believe the library system has in its budget adequate funds to keep the libraries open
1331425 the library at this time is well funded to withstand a little belt cinching
1331426 the number one request was to keep libraries open as much as possible
1331427 not a measurable amount only a corner of a baggie
1331428 they advised us to get rid of it not to charge her with it
1331429 in my mind at that time i thought i wasnt being charged with the marijuana because they needed me to testify against my husband
1331430 at no point in time was there any talk whatsoever or any intention on the commonwealths part of not charging her with the marijuana charge in exchange for her testimony she had been willing to testify from the beginning it had nothing to do with the marijuana whatsoever
1331431 i guarantee you it would have been employed to the hilt
1331432 this possibility of a reward that ms ahmad perceived gave her a direct personal stake in the defendants conviction
1331433 this stake gave ms ahmad a powerful motivation to testify favorably for the commonwealth
1331434 the non disclosed evidence was sufficient to create a reasonable probability that the jury would see her in an entirely different light
1331435 did not receive a fair trial ending in a verdict worthy of confidence
1331436 were glad the judge saw it our way and we look forward to a full and fair trial
1331437 theres nobody here are you here to see a detective

1331441 how the judge ultimately determines the amount of loss will likely be significant to the sentence
1331442 it would be unusual in a case of this magnitude to avoid any form of confinement
1331443 with the cost of living increasing a significant number of us are being forced to use our savings to meet the rising costs you never know when youre going to need to fall back on your savings and in this respect dipping into them to meet bills such as gas bills is no bad thing
1331444 call the police make me lose my job ill kill you
1331445 due to the critical nature of the ongoing investigation it is not in the publics best interest to discuss those issues until the investigation is concluded
1331446 was overwhelming that you were a leader in this conspiracy
1331447 its an astronomical amount of pcp that is coming here and being dumped into the community
1331448 the difficult thing about the facts of this case is that a good penal system has a graduation of privileges and penalties
1331449 theres always a risk that a youth with privileges will take advantage in hindsight its clear that dyrs made a mistake

1331632 some of the people who are involved in this are relatively low ranking people who shouldnt have had access to any kind of key so were still a little puzzled as to how that happened
1331633 someone else had to help them get access to the key whether thats our person or someone else

1331646 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss after it i leaned back and i said you cheated and he said why and i said i dont kiss on the first date then he said well i never really play by the rules

1331648 would probably make you think that this would stand for pahn the king but it is not i make this as a logo for a

1331650 while we were finishing uncharted we were already thinking ahead to some kind of trophy system for the playstation network so we created the medal system where players could win medals for making certain amazing accomplishments in the game whether it was getting three enemies with a single grenade or stealth killing five dudes from behind and so on
1331651 so when the cross media bar trophy system was announced and we got the development code for it it was super easy for us to dovetail our medal system with the trophy system and before we knew it we had it working
1331652 this is our medal system in uncharted so he has just killed three enemies with one grenade he gets the dyn o might medal we hooked it up so that a few seconds after you get the medal you get the trophy notification in order to get this you have to download the patch so you go to the psn site and patch uncharted then you can win trophies for any medal that you havent yet unlocked
1331653 once youve won a trophy you can just bring up the xmb by pressing the playstation button and it pauses the game then it overlays and you can go down into your uncharted group and see all the trophies that youve won as well as the ones you havent unlocked yet although some of those are secret and you wont see them until youve unlocked them this stuff of course is viewable in game just like you can for example play music in game you can go further into the trophies and study the detail and of course you can view them all from the main screen of the ps3
1331654 i think it will be a good reason for people to play the game through again which was one of our primary goals for creating the medals system in the first place i think because of the way uncharted is structured with those reveals and surprises the story is pleasurable in a different way the second time through in the way that a movie like memento is because once you know the surprises you can have a different appreciation of the story going and finding every last bit of treasure and making sure that you get lots of kills with every different weapon and earning all those trophies is a great way for people to explore nathan drakes world and get in touch with the richness of it
1331655 we didnt want to lock the uncharted save game we wanted to make it so you could copy it onto a memory stick take it around to your mates house and show him where you had got to that meant that we had to make it so that you had to start a new game if you wanted to get all the trophies otherwise wed have opened ourselves up to cheating people copying save games and so on we do have a system in our new game system when you start a new game from the very beginning you can bring over any medals that youve got which means you could start over youd keep your personal progress and youd get to unlock the trophies at the high end of the spectrum so people would see that you were getting the whole set in the game
1331656 i cant talk about that our current project is still unannounced we are very hard at work were quite a way into our next production cycle now its great having all of the uncharted code and tools but we havent announced anything yet i think all the horrible things that nate drake alludes to which the south seas pirates get up to with their prisoners will be inflicted on me when i get back to the office if i spill the beans
1331657 its code that runs on spus and its to do with things like animation compression generalised compression and rendering optimisations these guys are really old school programmers guys who are always looking to shave another cycle off an operation and part of the skill of developing for the playstation 3 is getting the gpu to farm jobs out to the six spus seeing which spus are idling and can take up some of the slack in a frame to frame kind of way
1331658 thats why we think were probably only using 30 or 40 per cent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential all third party developers can get the edge libraries for free and are going to be able to use them in their own ways to get more and more and more out of the ps3 over the years
1331659 in the near future multi platform ps3 games will outshine the versions running on rival consoles

1331731 yeah so after you left i was nicely playing my game when our intercom starts ringing over and over again the guy on it was really mad saying that he has been waiting forever for you and you havent come i went downstairs and told him that you left already which made him even more mad i told him we would pay the fare but he wouldnt listen and wanted much more than a mall fair oh and he wanted to fight me
1331732 well you are going to have to make sure and check next time because it could have been bad finally i was able to pay him a good sum and he left avoiding the fight oh and by the way we have been taxi blackballed

1331743 technological advances have allowed us to explore oil offshore in ways that protect the environment
1331744 could produce enough oil to match americas current production for almost 10 years

1331746 we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
1331747 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
1331748 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
1331749 i think people are reassured that not a drop of oil was spilled during katrina or rita
1331750 those rigs in the gulf there was not a single incident of spillage that anyone reported

1331771 how long must we stand by and look on while our future generations are destroyed by just a few selfish individuals much too often we have the luxury to say i dont care but we shall soon find in one way or the other that all of us can be affected by the dividends of tolerating child abuse anywhere in society
1331772 but we still have problems they are screeching the floor and we have a leaky roof this is so serious that anytime it rains we have to scoop water out we do not have adequate furniture and we have only one trained teacher who is in charge of the whole kg necessitating the need to get at least two more trained attendants whose salary we cannot bear now
1331773 we are counting the cost to know how much debt we have incurred
1331774 but like many others the government has found a way around the situation and until the unforeseen happens the situation is firmly under control

1331776 we are not aware of any such shortages but we hope it does not come to that
1331777 if you find some filling stations not having products it may likely be as a result of the fact that omc is unable to settle its indebtedness with ceps or may also have defaulted in its statutory obligation

1331787 one unexpected weather event can push us over the precipice
1331788 they talk about free market but you dont see it

1331793 the danger is that the fish will usually not be able to get past the blockage when they are heading up stream to spawn because it acts as a dam
1331794 also fish that get trapped in these pools will stay there in times of low water and when the swimmers return they are stressing these fish sometimes unintentionally and sometimes intentionally these fish are usually resting in these pools and due to high water temperatures they cannot stand great amounts of exertion because the water contains very little oxygen
1331795 we have a really bad scenario happening here now with a large amount of returning salmon probably the best return in numerous years but the water levels have dropped and now these salmon are stranded in the rivers until we receive enough rain to get them moving
1331796 these two rivers have been closed to angling for some time in hopes that the salmon population would return to a sustainable harvest level
1331797 it is our job to protect these fish and this is done through education but also can be done through enforcement
1331798 people that intentionally try to harm these fish will be dealt with by the enforcement approach but hopefully we can educate enough people about these fish and the need to protect them that they will become true stewards of the resource and do what is necessary to help them survive
1331799 we are asking people to be vigilant and keep an eye out in their neighbourhoods
1331800 i think he always had a book on berwick in the back of his mind hed always be talking to people and he had his own little office in one of our bedrooms
1331801 hed come to bed and maybe 10 or 15 minutes later hed get up and go write something down something he didnt want to forget anything he was into it would be on his mind
1331802 after he died i just wrote a little note saying id look after the loose ends
1331803 i had no idea i met so many nice people in berwick and everyone has a story i could have continued on

1331808 if we can medal any medal it would be just amazing
1331809 i could walk away from my sport tomorrow and feel very happy about my achievements but an olympic medal would make the finished product
1331810 i go into every race believing that i can win my list of achievements helps put other competitors off
1331811 i am very much a short course swimmer and the olympic games are long course
1331812 im very good at long course but my forte has always been short course
1331813 my father at the age of 11 got thrown in a lake petrified of water and unable to swim
1331814 he still cant to this day but was determined that my sister and i for safety reasons first and foremost would learn to swim
1331815 from an early age i just had to race people i had this competitive thing
1331816 or que raconte jenifer peine une semaine plus tard dans un long entretien accord

1331820 i never retired i love it so much and im still pretty good at it so i dont feel the need to stop and i dont plan on slowing down after the age of 26
1331821 while california has historically been a place of great invention it now also leads the us in environmental policy
1331822 so it comes as no surprise that the state should be leaders in green technology as well we feel privileged to have been invited to exhibit at the green tech expo and look forward to delivering innovative technology that helps people conserve water while saving money and helping to sustain the environment
1331823 the major message in long term conservation is that we dont live in an area that can support the kind of landscapes that we have we are talking about lifestyle changes were not saying it all has to be rocks and cactus but we have to be making smarter more efficient choices
1331824 congestion has grown dramatically in the united states in the last 25 years
1331825 its kind of a win win win policy and states need to be encouraged to look at this
1331826 you get less house and property for the same price but were willing to make that sacrifice to save on gas prices and commuting costs
1331827 there is a whole confluence of government policies tax spending regulatory and administrative that have subsidized sprawl
1331828 our parking control officers are able to enforce street sweeping regulations on only about 20 percent of the routes
1331829 sweepercam would raise that rate to 100 percent which means more equitable enforcement in our residential neighborhoods

1331833 ease of use and simplicity was certainly a focus for this integration
1331834 together fujitsu and marex provide the easiest possible deployment of a complete content management solution
1331835 the fujitsu fi 6000ns network scanner was designed with the simplicity of our desktop scanners in mind while also considering the advance uses and applications required in a network scanner
1331836 this integration with filebound helps to further penetrate various scanning applications with its simple deployment filing indexing and scanning processes
1331837 many broker dealers who are currently using laserapp are looking to interlinks electronic signature solution to eliminate the need to go out to paper
1331838 without our technology the advisors are forced to print an electronic form in order to capture a wet ink signature maintaining a straight through process significantly increases productivity and reduces costs
1331839 by making it easier to do business we fully expect to see sales increase
1331840 we are empowering our representatives with the tools they need to be more efficient and focus on driving business versus managing paper

1331846 paul kernan is obviously in consideration so is enda mcnulty brendan donaghy martin ferris and barry shannon
1331847 they were extremely well organised they are very physically strong right up the middle and that is well complemented by their speed on the flanks
1331848 their target men of ciaran lyng and mattie forde tortured down throughout and the work of pj banville out the field was very impressive as well
1331849 you have lyng with his left foot coming in from the right side and mattie forde with his right foot coming in from the right
1331850 both are free takers and redmond barry at number 10 was also hugely impressive against down
1331851 i would also single out their midfield for attention because they controlled proceedings by and large for most of the game
1331852 bar the 25 minutes against dublin they basically havent been beaten this year
1331853 they played a sweeper and got a lot of people back behind the ball
1331854 they will be extremely difficult to break down and were not altogether too fond of leaving ourselves short of men at the back either

1331900 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1331901 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1331902 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight
1331903 even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first

1331958 the interaction and support between industry and academia is now more important than ever schraders support of this initiative within the university will help to enhance the learning experience resulting in a more industry ready student with practical as well as theoretical experience
1331959 this is a fantastic project which challenges students to work as a team and to put the skills taught in lectures into practice

1332039 the citys leading champion of term limits is privately signaling a new openness to a third term for several business leaders who have spoken with businessman and philanthropist ronald lauder have left with the impression that he would not challenge an effort to extend term limits by a referendum a source with knowledge of the conversations said
1332040 these named business leaders should leave impressions to comedians they are totally off base
1332041 mr lauder will defend the voters choice of a two term limit for city politicians as is and the in depth polling we have done shows voters wont tolerate any tinkering with the law do these people really think voters want to reward the distinguished public servants who gave us the city council slush fund scandal with more time in office

1332116 ugly aur pagli opened to only 30 40 per cent profit at most of the single screens and multiplexes pnc couldnt cash in on mallikas sexy image people were looking forward to some steamy scenes but there was only one song that showed her in skimpy clothes instead of 99 slaps and one kiss it should have been 99 kisses and one slap mummy 3 too didnt open to a full house kuselan had an unexpected opening at single screens and multiplexes it is doing good business
1332117 the poor opening of ugly aur pagli is definitely a wake up call for mallika sherawat it was her solo release after a long time the film managed to garner a mere 30 40 per cent opening whereas the mummy 3 that released on the same day managed to get a bigger opening even in its hindi dubbed version for a small film like ugly aur pagli the word of mouth holds importance as audiences these days rely more on that the critics have universally panned the film the weekend saw some increased footfalls but again on monday the response slumped but there are chances of the film doing well in the home entertainment circuit also with biggies like singh is kinng bachna ae haseeno and god tussi great ho lined up in the following week viewers may be planning to give this a miss
1332118 it was a disappointment to see mission istaanbul money hai toh honey hai and even ugly aur pagli getting an opening of 35 per cent on the other hand jaane tu ya jaane na and the dark knight showed a consistency at the box office collection especially over the weekends
1332119 the collections of the first three days at cinemax of ugly aur pagli are 65 per cent lets wait and see if it sustains on monday while the mummy 3 has been 45 per cent kuselan is 15 per cent so far
1332120 the collections of ugly aur pagli for the last three days has been rs 3 17 000 all the shows for the mummy are housefull

1332134 at the critical juncture in all human relationships there is only one question what would love do now
1332135 success in life is a matter not so much of talent or opportunity as of concentration and perseverance
1332136 the road to success is not to be run upon by seven leagued boots step by step little by little bit by bit that is the way to wealth that is the way to wisdom that is the way to glory pounds are the sons not of pounds but of pence
1332137 in the private sanctuary of ones own conscience lies that spirit that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential
1332138 it is never too late to be what you might have been
1332139 you are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself if you forget that errand
1332140 it had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them they went out and happened to things
1332141 wherever you are is always the right place there is never a need to fix anything to hitch up the bootstraps of the soul and start at some higher place start right where you are
1332142 everything you need you already have you are complete right now you are a whole total person not an apprentice person on the way to someplace else

1332147 the world and most zimbabweans pray for a free and fair election not marred by violence and intimidation as in the past
1332148 we urge the sadc observers to produce a report characterised by integrity and honestly we have let down the suffering people of zimbabwe for too long already they deserve better
1332149 since the runoff was announced the violence in zimbabwe has gotten even worse zimbabweans cant vote freely if they fear their vote may get them killed

1332152 he confortola is out of danger he will stay at the base camp for a night and the armys pilots will fly helicopters on wednesday morning to rescue him if the weather has improved there
1332153 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1332154 at high altitude at over 8 000 meters it is too dangerous to mount a rescue to have the bodies returned
1332155 i have bad allergies so i started to cough because of the bad air out there
1332156 non criminal fugitive aliens an alternative to having us basically track them down arrest and remove them on the governments terms
1332157 this will allow them a little bit of control over the removal process that ultimately will come for each and every one of them
1332158 we believe the commercial is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession
1332159 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1332160 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1332161 the 45 year old male victim because the two housemates did not get along
1332162 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1332163 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1332164 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1332165 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1332166 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live
1332167 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1332168 the police are empowered to immediately arrest shopkeepers if they find any gta grand theft auto games on sale
1332169 gta is banned mainly because of its obscene content under the criminal law article 287 that prohibits reproduction distribution or possession of such material
1332170 we have stopped selling grand theft auto and inform all legal vendors to withdraw the game from their shelves

1332177 de marktwerking gekoppeld aan bezuinigingen door het kabinet pakken heel slecht uit voor de ziekenhuizen en dat vormt een bedreiging voor zowel de kwaliteit als de bereikbaarheid
1332178 want juist de kleine zeer waardevolle ziekenhuizen die zo belangrijk zijn om de ziekenhuiszorg goed bereikbaar en laagdrempelig te houden lopen gevaar ze dreigen te worden opgeslokt door grotere ziekenhuizen of komen in particuliere handen zoals het ziekenhuis in weert en het slotervaart in amsterdam waar winstoogmerk het uiteindelijke doel is
1332179 de gevolgen van al deze maatregelen worden nu meer en meer zichtbaar
1332180 there is damning evidence against asif that he was in possession of a banned drug when he arrived at the dubai airport
1332181 the report sent to pcb by the dubai authorities clearly states that the player was carrying the drug though it was in a very small quantity
1332182 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1332183 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1332184 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1332185 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight
1332186 even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first

1332227 either gold is going to fall hard and fast to catch up with the oversold readings in these ratios but gold stocks wont fall as much as the metal for instance we could see gold fall down to 850 while gold stocks actually hold up that would give us a powerful signal to go long gold stocks in 2005 for instance forget about it falling below the lower band for a second gold stocks lagged the metal badly for week after week then all of a sudden the stocks stopped dropping and the metal continued lower something like that could happen now last week i was looking for the stocks to hold support for a buy point but if they fail to do that this week then ill have to look for another signal to buy

1332300 we simply havent had practice time together weve trained different players at different times well have to form that chemistry quickly
1332301 but we already have players and coaches who understand what it takes to win i really think we can come back with a gold medal
1332302 we have great chemistry we understand the target is on our back
1332303 i saw the magnitude of what its about in 2004
1332304 ive been playing usa basketball since high school and as long as i have the chance ill be ready to play
1332305 while we arent able to prepare the 12 member team together at least everybody has had the chance to work with the head coach understand the strategy and have some sort of evaluation process
1332306 asafa powell right beside me is the second fastest man in the world and tyson gay is the world champion and hes running really fast and hell be up there so its all about whos got the perfect race
1332307 if i get a good start i know im going to do well so its pretty much how i react in the finals
1332308 my game over the 200 has got very good over the years i think im maybe 95 percent there and one day ill get the perfect race
1332309 it would feel good to win any olympic gold but im definitely going out there hoping i win both
1332310 a world record can go at any time but olympic gold lasts forever
1332311 olympic gold is closer to my heart than anything if i run 19 98 and i win im going to be happy as long as i win im going to be happy
1332312 i knew i could i be a good competitor but i guess im faster than i thought
1332313 i know im clean so i pretty much just do what i do
1332314 i hope he gets better because if i want to be the best i have to beat the best
1332315 so tyson gay needs to be in that race so i can say im olympic champion 100 percent
1332316 what an exciting group of young men and women that are going to be representing our country in beijing
1332317 there is no doubt that this is going to be a very strong team because they believe in the magic that theyve been able to capture here and theyre going to take to beijing
1332318 i still dont think im going to have a lot of pressure on me even though i ran that time
1332319 regardless it was wind aided so when we go to the next big race hes bolt still going to be the world record holder
1332320 i see myself as an average person and i try to just do my best and do my job
1332321 i have to be calm to be able to face the pressure i dont see myself as a superstar thats how i deal with it
1332322 previously confirmed to espn that he had spoken with federal authorities but insisted he has done nothing wrong and that fbi agents had asked him nothing about his own activities
1332323 i dont look at myself as being 36 and i certainly dont feel 36
1332324 for me its more about the mentality so i think i have a little more upstairs as far as experience that will help me
1332325 when it comes down to it it really is all about how you play on the field and being a part of this team regardless of what age you are is a great honor
1332326 it feels great its such an honor to be part of the team
1332327 its a big competition the world will be watching and its just a chance to represent my country its going to be a lot of fun
1332328 i think were all aware of that but i dont think we can change it at this point
1332329 its just up to us to get ourselves ready and to put our best foot forward and make sure that when the first game comes around that were ready to go the excitement of the olympics and of being a part of something like this will certainly help get us all ready to go
1332330 hopefully we will draw strength in seeing both our great comeback versus greece in 2004 knowing to never give up
1332331 we also saw how small the difference is between winning a medal and not when we played russia in the bronze medal match
1332332 as you get older and have more big match experience you become more confident in your own game as an individual player and also as a team
1332333 we have a solid team one through 12 the olympics is such a different kind of tournament its such an emotional ride up and down
1332334 it takes a real strong athlete and a real strong team to do well i thought we had that in the last olympics and since we have so many guys carrying over from that team i think we will have it this time
1332335 we feel very confident that we have selected the best team to represent this country at the upcoming olympic games
1332336 we have a good mix of experience and youth and we have 12 very good volleyball players on this roster they work well together both on and off the court and they compete at a very high level
1332337 i hope this is going to be the gold medal match in beijing
1332338 we played in australia the first tournament of the year against them
1332339 theyre playing really well right now we have a lot of work to do
1332340 theyre certainly the favorite to win the 2008 olympics in sheer talent theyre the best team
1332341 whether they become the very best team on the floor that remains to be seen but they certainly have as good a shot if not better than anybody there
1332342 i think the thing that is special about this team is that it has been a three year commitment
1332343 its not just about this year but its about what weve done in the past to get to this point
1332344 were hungry i think we have a team of guys who are hungry enough to satisfy coach ks code of basketball
1332345 the more the game went along the more comfortable they became we got a commitment to protect each others back
1332346 the americans are quick theyre talented and once they get out and start running and knock down a few shots it becomes very very difficult
1332347 its a week of competition thats come to a close and now we have a month to prepare for the olympics hopefully we can come back in another month and prove the u s is the best team in the world
1332348 i know ive made it but i havent read any articles or seen anything on tv
1332349 the comeback kind of blew me away when she was so successful last summer breaking the american record
1332350 once she did that i knew she was going to make the team
1332351 it only hit me after i had given birth and was swimming fast
1332352 there were about 5 000 swimmers there and it felt like 5 000 people said to me id love to see you go for another olympics even going into that meet i had no interest i was still breast feeding between events
1332353 not a lot of people expected me make this team
1332354 i knew i could make the team but it was a long shot
1332355 its definitely challenging both mentally and physically but having done it once now gives me the confidence to do it again
1332356 i dont feel sorry for myself im not going to cry victim
1332357 im a moving part on this team i do not encapsulate the whole i am a part without all of the moving parts the bus moves a little bit different but i know the team that will be fielded for china is going to be a great team
1332358 theres no doubt in my heart no doubt in my mind no doubt in my soul this team can win a gold medal
1332359 i am confident that the team will respond step up and bring the best out of each other
1332360 no one can replace abby so we will change the attacking style a little bit but we have been able to adjust the way weve played at several points during this year
1332361 our players are very brave so i think all of us will take this challenge and make the best out of it its a privilege to play under pressure and we like that
1332362 the biggest thing we can do is go and show the best softball theyve ever seen
1332363 if we put on the best show theyve ever seen than we can prove softball should remain in the olympics
1332364 it is a very exciting time as we are embarking on our last leg of the tour
1332365 the sites have been great we are going to be extremely focused the next month to get ready to defend our gold medal come august in china
1332366 we had our backs up against the wall and we responded i wasnt overly pleased but we showed that we can be explosive and score runs when we need to
1332367 its a team sport so i look at more of the team record than the individual the individual is nice but i never would have gotten there had it not been for holly mcpeak and kerri
1332368 she deserves every award shes ever received congratulations to her for all her hard work shes changed the game
1332369 were a really good team and theyre a great team great teams make the plays when it matters like that
1332370 we have to find a way to make great plays two sets or three sets together nicole and i have pushed them in every single final weve played against them its made us a better team and its making them a better team i just want to win some of these
1332371 i am overly elated to be selected to my fourth olympic games
1332372 it was an emotional moment for all of us though to be selected coach jenny lang ping called us in by groups to tell us who was selected it was an awesome moment when my name was called
1332373 russia and serbia were not at the world grand prix but in the finals there were six teams qualified for the olympic games three of which we will play in our pool
1332374 we are pretty close except brazil dominated the world grand prix
1332375 i dont think every team put forth their best lineup in every match as teams tried to evaluate different players i think we played better each week especially in the fourth week our physical conditioning was a little tired and that made it a little harder for the players we still had our goals and worked hard especially to play more consistently
1332376 winning the olympics means a lot to brazil i hope to start on the right foot
1332377 what motivates me is the chance to go down in history with the brazilian team by winning the gold medal
1332378 not many players have a chance to play at the olympics i want this medal
1332379 and we feel a little fortunate some times we know they are a good team and we respect them as much as they respect us over the past four or five years these have been the two best franchises in the league so to meet again in a final is pretty special wed still like to hold the edge on those finals but theyre a good team
1332380 we always think whats happened in the past doesnt count
1332381 weve beaten houston already but that means nothing its who gets the job done on the night the past is exactly that the past
1332382 one goal goes in and theres going to be a lot more to follow
1332383 were not really worried about that weve been doing some finishing during training hopefully that translates into something
1332384 the last tournament was a chance for us to find the right mix on the field
1332385 obviously we would have loved to score a goal i think we created enough chances the goal scoring part is going to come
1332386 in the two games ive played with him its been a learning curve
1332387 but im comfortable with the areas he runs in his ability in and around the box make him very effective and makes it easy for anybody to play with him it takes the press off because of his ability and experience
1332388 i suggest they wont find what they need in here like crazy fun and the happy hour
1332389 theres no alcohol here because its forbidden in the village its not the best nightlife of beijing
1332390 but the australian olympic committee has a big bowl out on the table and you can help yourself
1332391 until the competition is finished you tend to give people space
1332392 but therell be plenty of partying on the outside in the second week where theres an aussie theres a way to get drunk
1332393 is too many smiley and good behavior no tv and no frozen
1332394 rafael van der vaart is a player of great quality vision and talent
1332395 we are certain that he will be a player who will help us complement the already very strong squad we have
1332396 he is the first and almost certainly the last signing we will make this season
1332397 ive spoken a lot with sneijder and hes spoken very positively about real madrid
1332398 for me it is very exciting especially because i have such strong ties with spain
1332399 to imagine that im going to change would be utopic and dishonest
1332400 can you imagine me being a good boy who accepts everything and says yes to everyone i have ideas i know how the team works and ill go all the way
1332401 im not going to hold back my opinions i regret not being myself during the euro and im not going to do that again
1332402 people who think that a manager a coach and me in particular can be put under guardianship either theyre stupid or totally delirious
1332403 i made a communications error it wasnt the right time it was something personal you wont hear me ever again on this subject
1332404 its a failure when you dont qualify for a round its obvious we didnt have the feeling that we gave everything we could
1332405 its something a little different to what we are used to but its good
1332406 now that im going to be number one my only thoughts are on the olympics
1332407 i only got here yesterday and im jet lagged im more tired than normal physically ive had a lot of matches this summer but in three or four days i will feel different
1332408 he is in good spirits and will do what he needs to get back to world number one
1332409 he is going to be ready its one of his favorite tournaments for the year
1332410 my parents tell me when i was very very young i used to run around with a ribbon in my hand throw it up in the air then run out and do a cartwheel
1332411 i loved being in the gym and i loved being in my leotard i would never take it off and i would try and go to sleep in it when i fell asleep my parents would come into my room and take it off and id start crying as i wanted to sleep in my leotard
1332412 i look at her in complete awe as she does the most beautiful gymnastics ive seen
1332413 im over the criticism i do gymnastics not to prove to anybody that im an all round gymnast i do it because i love it
1332414 i really am truly excited for this year because ive been working for so many years and suddenly this is like the year
1332415 having my dad as my coach that helps as hes been there and hes done that he knows me personally better then anyone will ever know me
1332416 having studied in detail the programmes of real madrid and the dutch eleven i realised that given the physical effort required to perform at my maximum i was going to have to make a choice
1332417 obviously such a decision is not something one takes in a night i have experienced a great euro 2008 with the orange team and i look back on it with fondness
1332418 of course i find it a pity that i wont be able to call on his quality and international experience in putting teams together in the future

1332422 i can only promise that we will only start work if we have complete permission of the court and the people
1332423 this is the first time the company has made any such commitment to comply with international law which recognises tribal peoples right to give or withhold consent for developments which profoundly affect their future
1332424 vedantas executive director kuldip kaura backed up mr agarwal by emphasising the local people have to give their consent
1332425 the request is comparable to that of london based vedanta resources wish to construct a strip mine to extract bauxite from the niyamgiri sacred mountain in orissa
1332426 the mountain is worshipped as the home of niyam raja the god of the 8 000 strong tribe
1332427 this is a david and goliath struggle weve applied to knock down st pauls to raise awareness of vedantas outrageous plan to destroy the kondhs spiritual home
1332428 just as londoners wouldnt tolerate the demolition of their cathedral to make a quick buck so the kondh people wont allow their treasured mountain and forests to be destroyed
1332429 vedantas investors should be appalled that their money is backing the desecration of a sacred indian site and the destruction of forests on which people rely for food clean water and a living
1332430 people need and want development but projects which threaten to deny tribal communities of their most important asset cant be seen as a step forward
1332431 an issue of exceptional public importance or on a panel decision that conflicts with a decision of the united states supreme court or of this court
1332432 the problems have been difficult weve all heard the reactions of head teachers and weve heard the apologies from the qca and their contractor and theyve acknowledged the reputational damage
1332433 but it still remains the case that ofqual are advising us that the quality of marking is as good as its been in previous years
1332434 there are always reviews and appeals that happens every year i have confidence in these figures that we are putting out today
1332435 compared to 1997 101 000 more 11 year olds are now achieving the target level for their age in english and 93 000 more in maths
1332436 these are alarming figures suggesting that fewer pupils are achieving excellence and that pupils are not being stretched to the best of their abilities
1332437 the shambles surrounding the marking of this years tests are a disgrace 460 schools still do not have results for all of their pupils
1332438 this year as every year the results are based on a statistically robust sample any claims that not all the results are available and therefore they should not be published should be dismissed as ill informed nonsense
1332439 i have no doubt however that the serial detractors who rush every year to criticise the outcome of the tests will once again be much in evidence
1332440 instead of publishing the results the government should have taken the opportunity to ask lord sutherland to conduct a fundamental review of the entire flawed testing system
1332441 criticising the publishing of the sats results shows a lack of understanding of statistical theory with almost complete returns the results are reliable at a national level

1332446 and tyson gay is the world champion and hes running really fast
1332447 i wish him the best so he can get back in shape
1332448 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1332449 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1332450 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious
1332451 its been done and resolved and we escaped this disaster
1332452 if i have to get on a plane and go back to india i will
1332453 its just a tough environment and they are in the next fiscal year going to feel the brunt in the recent run up in oil and commodity cost
1332454 there are things we need to go through and from that conversation we will move forward
1332455 with brett coming back if they do open it up to a competition then i get a chance to compete
1332456 we invited all the outfielders who played a certain number of games he definitely was invited
1332457 we would love for him to come he was definitely a big part of this organization
1332458 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1332459 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1332460 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious
1332461 its been done and resolved and we escaped this disaster
1332462 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1332463 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1332464 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1332465 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1332466 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1332467 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
1332468 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organized
1332469 in the future we need to be more hands on and pro active on issues that engage our image and credibility
1332470 it is heavily image based we cannot allow to be hijacked by pressure groups and vested interests
1332471 the games must be read within the context of each nation
1332472 we are being hosted by the chinese the ioc and the olympic movement should not be expected to resolve issues which are not related to the athletic competition we would compromise our mission and responsibility if we tried to resolve all problems unrelated to the games
1332473 i have no doubt that we will stage high level olympic games with distinguishing features and open a new chapter in the olympic movement
1332474 its had a bit of a rough time in the states its opening against one of the highest grossing movies batman
1332475 people in the states are so used to lots of cgi action and sex and we dont really offer a lot of that in this film
1332476 here every creed and race find an equal place but there is no solidarity only the africans celebrate the fact that they are free only the indians celebrate the fact that they arrived what is the point of being cosmopolitan if we cant even be bothered to share our triumphs and our failures
1332477 it is a small action it has not made the international press
1332478 economic growth closely depends on the interaction between new knowledge and a countrys ability to learn
1332479 whilst spouses may have the skills experience or qualifications to make them the most appropriate candidate for work in their partners parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1332480 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment by mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1332481 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents work as an mp
1332482 these findings should not be surprising because cocaine and other drugs are traded using cash which is handled by the same fingers that directly touch the drugs or wrappings
1332483 moreover many cocaine users use a wrapped banknote to sniff this drug so inducing direct cocaine contamination of the banknotes
1332484 reminder that the man for whom your city is named encouraged his followers to be patient and forgiving we look forward to seeing you next month

1332487 screw you my kids arent going to be cold this winter
1332488 producers have been informed she has to appear in only flattering lighting and close ups on her face are apparently a no no pamela has been around this game long enough to know the pitfalls of a bad camera angle
1332489 aint it awful if those little girls slept with as many men as they say in the tabloids why their little butts would have more fingerprints than the fbi
1332490 it will be a once in a lifetime experience that doesnt come along that often
1332491 naturally were all absolutely delighted that gareth barry will be staying at villa park
1332492 there will be no deadline and liverpool will have all the time in the world to sign him theyve got to the end of the transfer window at the end of the month
1332493 i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
1332494 the basics of what barcelona did were very similar to our own from the warm ups to their set piece work and passing drills the only difference is the barcelona lads could control the ball
1332495 basically stoke wasted the lads time they made him an offer he asked for a bit more and they said thats it they disrespected him and im not happy with it it was disgraceful will i speak to tony pulis no but footballs a small world and what goes around comes around
1332496 he wont be coming to the club we wish him well younes has decided to go elsewhere it might help if i took him to a casino until 4am maybe that might have helped the deal i havent been up until 4am for a long time id have been asleep
1332497 i think hed be the first to admit things havent happened for him while hes been here
1332498 i was bitten by a spider three weeks ago and ended up being rushed into emergency i kept thinking i was cursed that somebody somewhere had a little doll of me and was sticking pins in it
1332499 im not much of an athlete i eat a lot of mcdonalds im probably overweight for an athlete
1332500 the humiditys quite fun its like rowing through a steam bath
1332501 gymnastics is very difficult if someone slips a little they are out boxing and football are easier
1332502 ill have to settle down because i cant shark forever
1332503 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending
1332504 vaughan is crucial for england to regain the ashes next year because he is such a good captain
1332505 he will believe he can be the best captain ever hes that kind of bloke
1332506 there is no time to be excited and be happy and enjoy i have olympics in one week i have to be very focused all the time
1332507 i believe its a big step and a step in the right direction
1332508 he has the hand eye coordination of a hungry rattlesnake
1332509 please can i just remind you to keep off the playing area or you will be taken away and ejected from the ground just like that chav in the white t shirt
1332510 coming on for ajax is number 26 ummm there isnt a number 26
1332511 the possibility of closing the strait of hormuz easily and on an unlimited basis
1332512 oft ist ja der stau vor dem man gewarnt wurde gar nicht mehr da
1332513 damit man wenn man einen stau umfahren will nicht in einem anderen stau landet
1332514 i loved that bit with the tiger you know when it comes into the archipelago and starts eating all the sheep
1332515 but all the children really love it and they try and tame it but it eats them too and its totally symbolic of stalin and stuff
1332516 yeah the bit with the tiger is good but what about the bit with the football match
1332517 he is a great citizen of russia and my favourite writer
1332518 my favourite novel is cancer ward there is so much optimism in it so much life affirmation he never forces his ideas upon you but rather asks you to meditate and you come to understand its seriousness and greatness yourself
1332519 people with his understanding of life were our last hope
1332520 today young children are growing up and they dont know anything
1332521 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1332522 initial analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1332523 you can see that the arrears for together are substantially higher than for the standard product
1332524 the chancellor and the government were totally irresponsible for failing to heed my warnings from last october that the bank should be stopped from giving out 125 together mortgages these shocking figures show northern rock has 6 3bn in unsecured loans it was clear even then that they could never be repaid in a falling housing market
1332525 alistair darling assured parliament that taxpayer loans to northern rock would be fully secured on mortgage assets this is clearly not true
1332526 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1332527 gordon brown and alistair darling promised taxpayers the loan to northern rock would be repaid in full but now just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1332528 you need to bear in mind that the eu state aid rules do not allow for a drip feed of capital into the bank we have selected an amount that we believe is comfortable for the whole period of temporary public ownership
1332529 i cant discuss the case but its bad when people say opinions as if they are stating facts especially when its people who are trusted by the society that whatever they say is true
1332530 it was said eight years ago that zuma must get his day in court now that has been changed they say im the one who asked to be taken to court
1332531 the media is writing non stop that zuma is just delaying this case how can i be accused of delaying tactics
1332532 even there at the constitutional court one of the ten judges agreed with the durban one that the search was unlawful
1332533 now i dont know where the issue of delaying the case comes from because im following procedure i have a problem with that statement because im exercising my constitutional rights but im accused of delaying tactics
1332534 please i must not be intimidated when im exercising my rights if im not guilty then i have to protect myself
1332535 why would one judge before the court does it is a pity sometimes that i dont get the chance to respond to everything thats being said about me
1332536 thank you for your support you are the people who are protecting our democracy i know now that no matter what happens you will protect your country
1332537 i love you all and i will always listen to what you say when you ask me to do something i wont argue ill do exactly that
1332538 our president zuma is the target of a political conspiracy led by the state president mbeki on many occasions our president mbeki failed to intervene he fired him zuma as deputy president he found him guilty before the court could do so
1332539 we need an early election so that zuma can be the president of the country
1332540 constitutional court judge president pius langa and his friends will never have zuma if you want to touch him you must touch us first
1332541 on the last day of this nonsense we will take zuma to the union buildings
1332542 the youth of this country know what they must do and they will do it if jacob zuma faces jail
1332543 no other agency provided us with the opportunity to meet the people wed be working with
1332544 there are things were doing that very few other counties are doing and its starting to work
1332545 were seeing steady but sure growth in the county in a tough time
1332546 the olympics is the ultimate global sporting event and viewers will be astounded by the quality of the bbcs hd footage every drop of water falling off the oars of a rower to the sand erupting from the long jump pit will be beautifully clear
1332547 at freesat were committed to bringing brilliant hd programming to as many uk viewers as possible for free the scope of bbcs hd coverage of the beijing olympics is testament to the exciting future of hd broadcasting in this country
1332548 ekaterina and ronnie were all over each other they were holding hands and ronnie introduced her to everyone as his girlfriend kat
1332549 its very weird to see she looks like she could be his granddaughter he is obviously very fond of her
1332550 it will come in time when we want to do it
1332551 we both think a wedding on a beach would be very romantic when the time is right
1332552 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1332553 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1332554 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1332555 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1332556 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1332557 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
1332558 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
1332559 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
1332560 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
1332561 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
1332562 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1332563 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1332564 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1332565 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1332566 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1332567 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1332568 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1332569 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
1332570 vemos estas empresas a continuar a perder dinheiro pelos pr ximos trimestres
1332571 a carlsberg conseguiu subir os pre os e ainda est a ganhar quota de mercado
1332572 a conjuntura externa voltou a deteriorar se e as consequ ncias disto para o northern rock s o um aumento das perdas de cr dito
1332573 este aumento parcialmente atribu do ao facto da empresa ter restringido os seus crit rios para a aplica o da sua pol tica de capitaliza o e a diminui o do n mero de hipotecas a tend ncia subjacente demasiado evidente
1332574 even with inflation at five per cent the recent drop in oil prices along with still weak data means the fed will likely remain on hold for at least another month

1332577 instead of analyzing or proselytizing this book takes us right into the heart of the matter
1332578 this powerful book can help bolster a wounded sense of self offer a community of support and deflect the barbs of cruel sad cowards it is not just helpful and heartwarming its potentially life saving
1332579 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
1332580 is always pained to have to extend tours he understands the effect that has on the families of our forces but he also appreciates our commanders need to make additional progress while the weather is still good in afghanistan
1332581 todays commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents
1332582 so clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money
1332583 as we stand here today we intend to keep both drivers
1332584 and i dont think thats ever been in any doubt to be honest
1332585 im just happy that he had a really strong race here jarno would have had a stronger race if he hadnt been caught behind mark webber because of a bad start overall im very happy we had a strong result today
1332586 certainly from the moment timo drove out of the garage on friday he has been on it all weekend
1332587 if you really look at his sector times from qualifying earlier in the season he was struggling to put a complete lap together but generally showing he had the speed to do it
1332588 selling their possessions to give to those who were in need
1332589 last year we were able to give away 100 of our tithing income as a church to community needs
1332590 im frustrated that many in the 18 40 generation are still living in what i perceive to be a glorified youth group mentality where they want the benefits of church while also the staunches critics of church but unwilling to make the financial sacrifices necessary for healthy communities and ministries to flourish im not thinking big here im thinking deep in short i would say we need to grow up
1332591 it will be a once in a lifetime experience that doesnt come along that often
1332592 naturally were all absolutely delighted that gareth barry will be staying at villa park
1332593 there will be no deadline and liverpool will have all the time in the world to sign him theyve got to the end of the transfer window at the end of the month

1332612 i am hoping to be playing in the championship for a team on loan next season
1332613 that would be ideal jay simpson is a great example to us because of what he achieved at millwall
1332614 you can tell with him that he has come back a better player he tells us how different it is to be playing for a side like that you always need to win at that level and having that gives a player an extra edge
1332615 you see in jay what a spell away can do for you
1332616 he is a much better player now and more confident in what he can do
1332617 i think getting that experience will give me the same things
1332618 ok players x y and z didnt work out and we think this is why with the next batch well try and add coaching technique b to their development
1332619 well i was gonna sign barry alonso etc but didnt wanna get involved in an auction with stoke

1332626 forest clearing for palm oil is worse than illegal logging a excavator can clear 30 hectares a day imagine if they have 10 thats 300 hectares a day there are at least 250 palm oil companies the destruction is massive if you stop the company you can save the orangutans
1332627 dont vote for barack because you think hes cute or because you like his smile
1332628 every year there is one outstanding documentary that you cannot miss that people will talk about because of its significance to the planets future this coming year the burning season is that documentary
1332629 this film is going to be controversial in test screenings i have already found that audiences are forming very different opinions of dorjee and his carbon trading solution some say that saving forests is so important and urgent that they dont care what method is used others argue the merits of carbon trading or say it just wont work and there are those who are concerned with where the profits from the scheme will go the film has already generated heated discussion on these issues my objective in telling this story is to give audiences the opportunity to observe a young man as he goes on a quest to find a solution to the forest crisis to see the huge obstacles and opposition he confronts and despite enormous odds watch him pull off a big deal
1332630 aan het eind van dit jaar moeten jullie allemaal zo goed frans kunnen dat jullie niet meer eh zeggen en het gewoon vloeibaar spreken
1332631 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1332632 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction

1332637 through this blessed jihad in yunnan this time the turkestan islamic party warns china one more time our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics
1332638 transcript of alleged statement of commander seyfullah released to the media by intelcenter washington 23 july 2008 http www intelcenter com
1332639 the pakistani terrorism sponsoring activities along the silk road were the primary instrument of islamabads regional strategy the isi sponsored insurgency and terrorism along the western gateways to the prc were strategic developments with grave ramifications
1332640 china reportedly said that east turkestan uyghur islamic terrorists are operating on pakistans soil and trained in special camps in its territory this is the first time beijing administration charged pakistan for harboring anti china elements in its soil the revelation came in a court document in the trial of jailed canadian celil in which it was mentioned that celil joined the east turkistan liberation organisation etlo way back in 1997 and acted as a senior instructor in kyrgyzstan as per the document celil allegedly recruited people and sent them to various training camps on the pamir plateau in pakistan territory etlos prime objective is to carve an independent east turkestan by uniting parts of china and kyrgyzstan
1332641 warned athletes and spectators particularly the muslims to stay away from the olympics
1332642 the collection exploitation analysis and dissemination of terrorist and rebel group video materials

1332646 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
1332647 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1332648 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1332649 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1332650 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning
1332651 i backed my car into a cop car the other day
1332652 when you are nervous about everything else you put your money in a toll road
1332653 thats the logic of infrastructure returns are stable and predictable you wont get fabulously rich but youll get stable cash flow
1332654 were just looking at ways to be more efficient and thats why i used the term public private partnerships trying to find some creative solutions
1332655 the reason im avoiding taxes is because i think taxes are addictive
1332656 economic conditions are tough and are going to be very harsh on the performance of state budgets in 2008 and 2009
1332657 states are looking for long term solutions in running businesses a public private partnership is a tool in their toolboxes
1332658 weve seen an unprecedented number of headhunters recruiting for positions on the buy and sell sides
1332659 were very committed to this space our business activity has increased dramatically even this year
1332660 the argument for a public private partnership is the private sector is a lot smarter about paying attention to costs and because it has skin in the game will be more attentive to maintaining an asset over its life
1332661 elected officials often shortchange funding of maintenance because they dont want to increase user fees or taxes to pay for it
1332662 their election cycle is four years they can pass it on to someone elses watch
1332663 lotteries have infrastructure characteristics in that they have stable cash flows and high barriers to entry
1332664 they could even attract private equity investment because they are self financeable and require minimal capital expenses
1332665 lower and more predictable landing fees and terminal rentals for airlines which certainly arent flush
1332666 this is destroying the process of a two state solution
1332667 i hope the americans will make the israelis revoke the decision i think they can make the israelis do this
1332668 israel will continue to honour our commitments there will be no new settlements there will be no expansion of existing settlements and there will be no expropriation of land for settlement construction
1332669 it is paving the way to a one state solution we are afraid eventually that if there will be a peace treaty there will be so many settlements it will not be possible to implement it
1332670 i welcome this decision with much hope and with gods help we will build and bring those expelled from gush katif to a safe place
1332671 bibi is likely to be prime minister after the next elections
1332672 this government has reached an end and it doesnt matter who heads kadima they are all partners in this governments total failure
1332673 but its impossible to predict whats going to happen there are too many variables
1332674 has a prime ministerial aura and experience in executive positions precisely what livni lacks
1332675 who the fuck does he think he is whos the fucking superpower here
1332676 as a kind of speed bump that would have to be negotiated until a new israeli prime minister came along who was more serious about peace
1332677 savvy politician mindful of the sound bite and always ready to use it he tended to impress and befriend his interlocutors often by stretching or hiding part of the truth
1332678 netanyahu believes that the economic sphere is one where we can make quick tangible progress create more jobs and generate growth
1332679 that may yield the kind of political payoffs that could further political negotiations
1332680 but bibi may in fact be more sane on this issue than mofaz or barak
1332681 they dont believe in it any more people will vote for bibi because they say if there is no peace we might as well have a strong leader
1332682 the pre eminent obstacle to peace is israels colonisation of palestine
1332683 israels occupation of palestine has obstructed a comprehensive peace agreement in the holy land regardless of whether palestinians had no formalised government one headed by yasser arafat or mahmoud abbas or with abbas as president and hamas controlling the parliament and cabinet
1332684 israel has officially rejected its basic premises with patently unacceptable caveats and prerequisites
1332685 their best official offer to the palestinians was to withdraw 20 of them leaving 180 000 israelis in 209 settlements covering about 5 of the occupied land
1332686 the 5 figure is grossly misleading with surrounding areas taken or earmarked for expansion roadways joining settlements with each other and to jerusalem and wide arterial swaths providing water sewage electricity and communications this intricate honeycomb divides the entire west bank into multiple fragments often uninhabitable or even unreachable
1332687 especially troublesome is israels construction of huge concrete dividing walls in populated areas and high fences in rural areas located entirely on palestinian territory and often with deep intrusions to encompass more land and settlements
1332688 this will never be acceptable either to palestinians or to the international community and will inevitably precipitate increased tension and violence within palestine and stronger resentment and animosity from the arab world against america which will be held accountable for the plight of the palestinians
1332689 let me issue and control a nations money and i care not who writes the laws
1332690 conquered states can be held by the conqueror in three different ways the first is to ruin them the second for the conqueror to go and reside there in person and the third is to allow them to continue to live under their own laws subject to a regular tribute and to create in them a government of the few who will keep the country friendly to the conqueror
1332691 if there really was a coherent body organizing all of this what would their motivation be and where might all this be leading
1332692 the psychological rule says that when an individual remains unaware of the divisions within the world he experiences must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves
1332693 builders excavating the site of benjamin franklins former london residence recently discovered 10 corpses four adult and six child they were subsequently dated as coming from around the same period as his occupation some claim that this proves further that franklin known to be involved with various elitist masonic groups as well as the uks notorious hellfire club was a practising satanist who had participated in child sacrifices
1332694 shes so tiny shes only a pound two ounces it would have a very negative impact on her to be bitten by one of the mosquitoes
1332695 the best way to protect a horse from west nile infection is vaccination
1332696 horse owners with concerns should contact their veterinarian for information on vaccines and annual booster shots
1332697 it was our home for two and a half months and now were like ok so what do we do now
1332698 we wanted to make a documentary about whats going on across the u s with sustainability so we thought we can do it all on the same time and took off to do it
1332699 we had a cable through both of our front tires and through the frame but then they just came along and snipped it
1332700 i mean it was within 15 to 20 minutes that the bike was there the trailers were there everything was there but 15 minutes later nothing
1332701 we have both the bikes and quickly going through the ramifications we just lost our mode of transportation and half our stuff its pretty wild
1332702 we feel good about whats going on in the country and along the route we just had one person who chose to do something that wasnt so great
1332703 those are the people you most enjoy working for those that understand that those that love the horse
1332704 many advances in treating serious injuries occur because those types of owners say dont quit
1332705 we need to return to putting the emphasis on the horse that is what brought us here
1332706 the horse is easy to train it is hard to be patient the horse never lies weve got to make racing again about the horse
1332707 youre going to win the derby mrs genter i love you
1332708 fat happy and never work them farther than a half mile
1332709 bobby had a horse that got beat 15 lengths and came back to win his next start
1332710 where did he the horse stop and why did he stop there
1332711 his agent then was victor sanchez who wanted to introduce me to edgar
1332712 i became the leading trainer but edgar had a problem in that he kept getting suspended
1332713 may be a quiet gentleman but he is a keg of dynamite on a horse
1332714 he made me see the difference between a good and bad rider
1332715 the best trip of my life was with my friend barbaro he is in my heart forever i miss you my friend
1332716 four years ago i was thrilled and honored to be inducted
1332717 she had some neurological problems but you would never have known it from watching her run
1332718 she has the heart of a champion that intense determination to run and to win
1332719 people asked me how it felt to get in after being nominated 10 times and i said it feels better than getting turned down 11 times but this buds for the person that kept nominating him you would think after the first seven or eight times that person would have given up
1332720 when we got him he was a little slow and a little small they gave us the luxury of time and he ended up winning over 11 different tracks and setting three course records
1332721 in 24 hours he went from a leading businessman to fleeing the country and landing in hawaii
1332722 he called his friend mike shannon who went there with cash and credit cards he agreed to buy the horses and that cash helped cojuangco get his businesses back
1332723 who was a great partner and let us keep the horse in training at 4
1332724 my grandparents had a small stable and were getting rid of the horses
1332725 we wouldnt want to do another movie about a husband wife relationship
1332726 the plot line is thinner than paint stripper the lines more mildly amusing than witty and the acting isnt going to win any oscars but its one of those movies that just makes you feel good
1332727 we got a call from animal control from a woman walking her dog who saw two roosters tied at the feet by ribbons hanging upside down
1332728 all the religious sacrifices ive seen theyve taken the head this is the first time i have seen the heads stuffed back into the birds
1332729 twisted individual who would carry out a nefarious plot from within
1332730 our focus is how do we get them here safely
1332731 it is our interest and desire to have elephants back at the philadelphia zoo in a financially responsible way and in a way thats right for the elephants
1332732 a lot of the behavior around having a baby and birthing a calf and taking care of a calf maternal care is learned beahvior we want them to learn from our elephants
1332733 made excuses for the employees outrageous lapses and for her own failure to administer any consequences for failing to do their jobs
1332734 i read the grand jury report not just as the mayor of this city but also as the father of a daughter
1332735 it is appalling it is outrageous and i am heartbroken by what has happened here
1332736 i am fully thoroughly and completely pissed off about what has happened here when i think of my own daughter and if she were in someone elses care and city workers performed the way some of these individuals did i would kick their ass myself
1332737 the possibility that additional legal and or personnel actions may be taken
1332738 todays dhs is no longer the dhs of two years ago but the hard work to reform and improve must continue we take our responsibilities to the children very seriously
1332739 for the very few whoever they may be if this is not the kind of work that youre prepared to do then you should leave this city government right now
1332740 we dont need you and we dont want you in this government when we have the kind of behaviors that weve seen as a result of this grand jury report
1332741 poindexters slovenly neglectful and dangerously reckless work habits were not limited to danieals case
1332742 when i write about barack obama i get a huge response
1332743 thank you for demonstrating what an immature vulgar little jerk you really are
1332744 not adequately reimburse the hospital for the complex and often expensive surgery and treatments it undertakes
1332745 this is nothing we are going to beat you more
1332746 ce ne faremo dieci a testa in una settimana no
1332747 i hated it all but my first wtf moment was when i saw that it said book 1 bella i knew right then that she was going to change perspectives and it was going to suck so i braced myself to only like the first book i was wrong i had a wtf moment when edward and jacob didnt fight at the wedding wtf when she took her clothes off to have sex and then it was the next morning wtf when edward broke the headboard having too much vampire sex wtf when she got pregnant wtf when she called rose wtf when edward didnt want the baby and on and on and on big wtf with the name renesmee big wtf with edward chewing on the uterus i was totally let down by the way he stabbed the venom in her heart to change her i so wanted a tender sacraficing agonizing love biting scene that was alluded to at the end of twilight big wtf with jacob imprinting on the baby huge huge huge huge huge wtf with the tanking of the long awaited epic battle scene and when edward called jacob son i called it quits i looked up with a big look on my face that could only mean w t f
1332748 hey whatever happened to bella nearly fainting all the time at the mere smell of blood anyhow all of sudden shes ok with it and likes the taste dont tell me its a craving
1332749 another thing that bugged me was the part on the honeymoon where bella woke up from her dream crying and hysterical because she dreamed they stopped having sex or something like that i was so annoyed and revolted i pretty much skimmed over it jesus my lord for the sake of my sanity
1332750 who the heck is jazz when did transformers get involved
1332751 another wtf when alice comes back at the end how many times is her name printed on that page in a row
1332752 si passa un attimo dal tondo che devo dargli una cosa perch andrea in montagna e gli serve
1332753 si si per una cosa di giorno che engy e giulia son gi la che ci aspettano
1332754 m s all de la firma de un convenio concreto que es importante y se firmar en pocas semanas importan estas visitas porque muestran el inter s en el proyecto
1332755 no han terminado a n su trabajo aunque lo tienen bastante avanzado y es muy posible que antes de esa fecha pueda estar totalmente finalizado
1332756 that choice is whether to stick with rhetoric and policies wedded to free markets limited government and bellicose unilateralism or to endorse a more robust role for the public sector at home while relying more on diplomacy and international institutions abroad either way conservative republicans seem destined to have a much harder time winning elections for the foreseeable future just ask mccain how much fun hes having
1332757 either way conservative republicans seem destined to have a much harder time winning elections for the foreseeable future just ask mccain how much fun hes having
1332758 well before senators barack obama and john mccain rose to the top of their parties a partisan shift was under way at the local and state level for more than three years starting in 2005 there has been a reduction in the number of voters who register with the republican party and a rise among voters who affiliate with democrats and almost as often with no party at all
1332759 50 hedge fund mangers who made a combined 29 billion is one of my favorite barack obama campaign stories
1332760 ive been talking about giving up next year but i dont know what will happen ill see how my body feels
1332761 your body can only take you so far and i want to be able to run around with my kids i want to be healthy and able to walk around when i finish playing
1332762 i miss my kids because im not there every weekend and sooner or later i want to spend more time with them
1332763 i wont drop down the divisions gradually if i decide to call it a day it will be when i cant do the things im good at
1332764 i said to andy cole i dont know how he does it hes 36 and theres grezza graham alexander as well but the way theyve played over the years is probably different to me
1332765 ive been more about using my strength and doing a lot of running and when you get older it takes its toll sometimes
1332766 i think im the sort of person who can play around 30 games now i dont think ill be able to play saturday tuesday saturday tuesday
1332767 ill be happy to do whatever the gaffer wants of me this year
1332768 i still love the game definitely you cant beat it
1332769 youre getting paid for doing something you really enjoy and no one can complain about playing football and getting paid for it
1332770 but ive got a few things lined up for when ive finished playing ive got a couple of companies with my friend and thats another chapter
1332771 footballs not forever and everyone talks about what youre going to do afterwards but once ive finished playing its just another chapter
1332772 we are looking at bringing in one or two players not just for that position but in other positions too
1332773 weve got to remember that brett and reidy can play down there i think dunny has also played there in the past
1332774 the fact that brett can play there and also at right back were quite lucky with that
1332775 we had the chance of play aaron or zurab but i thought wed have a look at aaron
1332776 sparky brought him to rovers as a centre half but he continued to play him in midfield
1332777 hes strong quick and put in a lot of great tackles
1332778 im pleased to report that we did end the year with a balanced budget
1332779 so far we seem to be in a very good position moving on to next year
1332780 its simply the way the formula works and how it looks at your wealth and the effort youve been making in previous years
1332781 many people characterize it as unfair to stoneham and other communities like us it may not be right it may not be what we need but it is what the law is
1332782 until such time the state ever changes the formula were not going to see a whole lot of increase to our chapter 70 funding
1332783 how the state expects to find another 67 percent to fully fund the formula in the next two years is beyond me
1332784 the wealthier towns around us are making out much better than we are we do everything we can and its just not fair
1332785 it does not commit the town or the state to anything
1332786 but if we ever want to look at state support for a building renovation for the middle school i think it would be a good thing for the town and the school department to support the submission
1332787 bob margarita was the best coach that i ever had
1332788 not only was he a great football player in his own right with a great mind for the game but he taught you a lot about life he knew that he was coaching a game but also helping boys grow into men at the same time mr margarita was one of a kind
1332789 i began to suspect something when i saw this rocking chair hidden under a sheet
1332790 i was just so stunned when they started making the announcement about me
1332791 ill always say that coming back to stoneham to coach and teach was the best decision i could have ever made
1332792 bob margarita represented the best that we had to offer as a staff at stoneham high school
1332793 the one overriding thing about bob was that he always put the kids first he was always there with a kind word or a lollipop for the kids and he was as ardent a supporter of stoneham athletics as youll ever find
1332794 everyone thought he was this tough stern man but he was really very fair and was good to me
1332795 i remember one time when i had just been hit really hard for a loss in a game in green bay and coach halas pulled me out of the game
1332796 id thought id screwed up and i was so upset that i threw my helmet as i was coming off the field
1332797 halas looked at me growled and told me to go pick up that helmet then he came over put his hands on my shoulders and just looked at me he wasnt benching me he was just making sure that i was alright after the big hit
1332798 i left the bears to take a coaching job at bu that paid me 2 000 a year
1332799 i told the bears about my situation and they wrote back a really great letter and a check above and beyond my football salary for 500
1332800 this is a really great town with wonderful kids that come from really strong families you dont see graffiti and crime around here its because theres a lot of well educated good kids coming out of stoneham
1332801 the one thing i would stress to the kids is that in football just like in life you cant ever give up
1332802 there will be days when things dont go your way but youve got to keep pulling yourself up and fighting your way through
1332803 we lost a heartbreaker to newburyport one year on a long touchdown pass at the end of the game
1332804 i vividly remember the speech coach gave us after the game was over he told us that we better not dare hang our heads because wed given it our best out in the field
1332805 he told us that if we always gave it our best shot then we had nothing to be ashamed of
1332806 he taught us lessons like that and he always put the kids first no matter what he made each of us feel special
1332807 i loved getting up every day and coming to school
1332808 i loved being with the kids and still being involved with athletics
1332809 at one point during the game i was looking around to put some of the younger players in to get some time
1332810 a group of my players got my attention and told me that our playing period was over i had no idea
1332811 the most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are
1332812 can i think of any reason not to pay or to pay less

1332827 the humiditys quite fun its like rowing through a steam bath
1332828 but he wasnt happy he couldnt find his place in the new russia he was like a breath of fresh air to us but his fate was very tragic
1332829 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer
1332830 he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i should say that alexander isaevich lived a difficult but happy life
1332831 its a great loss for our family its also a loss for the country
1332832 he was always really happy he returned this is his home
1332833 he was a writer first and his resistance came from that
1332834 he criticized the soviet union not as a westerner but as a russian with deep orthodox values
1332835 he was trying to find a third way for russia
1332836 for me he opened my eyes to a new side of life that i had never heard about
1332837 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials
1332838 he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1332839 the entire thorny path of his life will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism

1332893 without the support of the americans we would not have accomplished the mission because the british forces had done nothing there
1332894 i do not trust the british forces they did not want to lose any soldiers for the mission
1332895 i was not happy everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1332896 a coalition force would make a pact with essentially their enemy and promise not to go into their area so as not to get attacked
1332897 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
1332898 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem
1332899 that is what we were trying to do but it did not work
1332900 the proof is always in the actions and not just the words so well take a wait and see approach
1332901 we know it will take time to get rid of these bad elements and even some good people joined them because they fell into a trap
1332902 if the government fails to deliver on basic services and other needs of the iraqis sadr followers could use their new organization to tell people they should look to them as voice of change
1332903 we welcome any news about iraqis laying down their arms and working to rebuild this country
1332904 we will continue to fight until the occupation is driven out of iraq
1332905 journalists are forbidden to enter the area controlled by border police but the two disobeyed the rules
1332906 we are sorry for the incident and the damage to the equipment that belonged to the reporters
1332907 the chinese authorities have a right to protect the life and security of their law enforcement officials
1332908 however attacks such as these should not be used to justify the promotion or implementation of repressive or abusive security measures
1332909 por qu acevedo vil no convoca a una sesi n extraordinaria por qu quiere interferir indebidamente en el poder legislativo dictando la forma en que se deben considerar los proyectos que buscan aliviar la situaci n de los contribuyentes cu l es el miedo ahora
1332910 dada la envergadura y seriedad de una reforma contributiva tan pronto el gobernador convoque a una sesi n extraordinaria en cumplimiento de las disposiciones constitucionales instruir a los presidentes de las respectivas comisiones camerales a que citen de inmediato a vistas p blicas para considerar y obtener el insumo de los interesados en deponer u opinar en torno a las medidas que proponen los alivios contributivos

1332914 courage is almost a contradiction in terms it means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die he that will lose his life the same shall save it is not a piece of mysticism for saints and heroes it is a piece of everyday advice for sailors or mountaineers it might be printed in an alpine guide or drill book this paradox is the whole principle of courage even of quite earthly or quite brutal courage
1332915 o rthodox theology has specially insisted that christ is not a being apart from god and man like an elf nor yet a being half human and half not like a centaur but both things at once and both things thoroughly very man and very god

1332982 on crimes committed in the whole of darfur over the last five years
1332983 summarise the evidence the crimes and name individual s charged
1332984 the word is from those very close to bashir that bashir is obsessed with the idea that the world is out to get him
1332985 he already feels he has been humiliated and made to look weak
1332986 the perception in khartoum is that the icc is on dodgy ground legally the official policy is to ignore it ive heard the argument in khartoum that its white mans justice its focused entirely on africa and has done nothing on iraq or afghanistan
1332987 if the icc go after bashir it will have very negative effects
1332988 it tells the rebel movements in darfur to wait it out and the government will be changed by the icc the whole thing is not going to turn out well
1332989 has been documenting human rights abuses in darfur since the beginning of the conflict in 2003 and certainly since 2005 we have had enough evidence that very serious war crimes and crimes and humanity have been committed and we have recommended that the icc investigate right the way up the chain of command including omar bashir
1332990 this is a very decisive moment for the court it has been going through a terrible period this could revive its image and make people feel its a robust dynamic institution or it could be another blow

1333015 christianity and nothing else is the ultimate foundation of liberty conscience human rights and democracy the benchmarks of western civilization to this day we have no other options than christianity we continue to nourish ourselves from this source everything else is postmodern chatter

1333018 we are over the moon it is just such a relief

1333021 i just want to say that i am a proud welsh and punjabi sikh girl
1333022 this common sense judgment makes clear you must have a very good reason before interfering with someones religious freedom
1333023 our great british traditions of religious tolerance and race equality have been rightly upheld today
1333024 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
1333025 spying on 30 million people isnt part of my job description

1333027 endure master endure take it theyll hate you for it but that is the point of batman he can make the choice that no one else can make the right choice
1333028 well hunt him because he can take it because hes not a hero hes a silent guardian a watchful protector a dark knight
1333029 what would i do without you you complete me to them the public youre just a freak like me
1333030 the film making suggests the joker has like a shakespearean fool on pcp hit on a harsh truth batman has more in common with his killer clown foe than with the normal people he means to protect so should we conclude the dark knight argues that bush and bin laden are two sides of the same coin
1333031 every year i take the flag which is quite large
1333032 but in the second half after about five minutes a steward arrived and asked me to take it down she said you cant have that flag up
1333033 when i asked the manager why he said it was policy in the bridgewater hall that you cant have anything hanging from the sides i told them they were just being kill joys
1333034 would that really hurt if it fell on your head
1333035 who wants to get up and sing britons never never shall be slaves when the health and safety nazis are making a mockery of our freedom
1333036 they are trying to suppress us using the english ensign
1333037 i have asked them to look in their policy document and send me a photocopy of where it says you cant hang flags
1333038 the audiences for many of our greatest cultural events im thinking in particular of the proms is still a long way from demonstrating that people from different backgrounds feel at ease in being part of this
1333039 the prime ministers position on this is quite clear he thinks the proms are a good institution
1333040 no one was refused admission to the concert because of a flag and flags were in abundance as they always are at proms concerts
1333041 we do not allow large flags to be draped across the balconies in case they fall on patrons below and we take exactly the same approach with coats bags and other items
1333042 the halle proms concert was enjoyed by a capacity audience and we received no other comments
1333043 you used extremely poor judgment by insisting on openly reading this book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject in the presence of your black co workers
1333044 there is no university policy that prohibits reading scholarly books on break time
1333045 i do not wish to get into a general philosophical discussion with you
1333046 the chancellor has sent letters of apology to keith sampson to the co worker of keith sampson who filed the complaint and to two co workers who were interviewed as part of the investigation of the complaint in these letters the chancellor said he regrets this situation took place and believes this matter could have and should have been handled differently
1333047 this court victory is absolutely stunning the government has ducked and dived and refused to recognise the fact that these holds are barbaric and have no place in the british system
1333048 these inhumane methods should be withdrawn and a new safe system introduced for managing behaviour of young people in detention
1333049 there also needs to be a proper training system for staff better monitoring and oversight by the ministry of justice of what happens in these privately run secure training centres
1333050 if they change course al qaeda and the taliban are finished
1333051 terrorism killing of the innocent is against islam it is a faith of love and peace not violence
1333052 there are so many examples of people from other communities being caught with bombs and weapons why are they never convicted
1333053 it isnt about putting pressure on the irish we well understand that they have expressed themselves democratically but so have the other 26
1333054 they should have done everything that could reasonably have been expected of them
1333055 we understand that casual sex is dear to you but staying alive is dear to us listen to african wisdom and we will show you how to prevent aids
1333056 aids epidemics in africa are driven by people having sex regularly with more than one person
1333057 repeatedly our 25 member prevention committee put faithfulness and abstinence into the national strategic plan that guides how pepfar presidents emergency plan for hiv aids relief money for our country will be spent repeatedly foreign advisers erased our recommendations when the document draft was published fidelity and abstinence were missing
1333058 aids is no longer simply a disease it has become a multibillion dollar industry
1333059 easily preventable diseases are still killing millions of children each year while billions of dollars are being squandered annually by aids programs
1333060 although hiv causes 3 7 per cent of worldwide mortality it receives 25 per cent of international health care aid
1333061 telling men and women to keep sex sacred to save sex for marriage and then remain faithful is telling them to love one another deeply with their whole hearts most hiv infections in africa are spread by sex outside of marriage casual sex and infidelity the solution is faithful love
1333062 we the poor of africa remain silenced in the global dialogue our wisdom about our own culture is ignored
1333063 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
1333064 condemns the wanton or arbitrary destruction of any human being at any stage of its development from the point of conception to the point of death
1333065 many in western europe and japan see u s gun ownership rates and gun violence as a clear mark of difference with other industrial countries
1333066 would threaten the irish constitutional protection for the unborn given the almost universal acceptance and promotion of abortion at the eu level
1333067 the key to defeating the initiative is to keep it off the ballot in the first place
1333068 could be at risk for identity theft robbery and much worse
1333069 is showing a disgusting lack of respect for the democratic process and the right of all arizonans to participate in it
1333070 resemble those used by anti abortion activists to prevent women from entering abortion clinics
1333071 if you give me your signatures well leave you alone
1333072 trying to end affirmative action we let them know its up on the kkks web site
1333073 people have a right to sign a petition hear the arguments and then vote
1333074 everybody must be happy anybody not happy by noon tomorrow will be shot
1333075 if you choose to do commerce in colorado you have to abide by these rules
1333076 significant numbers appear to hold beliefs which contravene democratic values
1333077 these results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said there is no extremism in british universities
1333078 the finding that a large number of students think it is okay to kill in the name of religion is alarming
1333079 there is a wide cultural divide between muslim and nonmuslim students the solution is to stop talking about celebrating diversity and focus on integration and assimilation
1333080 our researchers found a ghettoised mentality among muslim students at queen mary also we found the segregation between muslim men and women at events more visible at queen mary
1333081 clearly we in no way associate ourselves with these views however also integral to the spirit of university life is free speech and debate and on occasion speakers will make statements that are deemed offensive
1333082 this disgusting report is a reflection of the biases and prejudices of a right wing think tank not the views of muslim students across britain
1333083 only 632 muslim students were asked vague and misleading questions and their answers were wilfully misinterpreted
1333084 violence or the incitement to violence has no place on a university campus
1333085 either you drop your civil rights complaint or youre out of here
1333086 midwestern levees are bursting polar bears are adrift gas prices are skyrocketing home values are abysmal airfares college tuition and healthcare border on unaffordable americans need do no more than check the weather look in their wallets or turn on the news for their daily reality check on a world gone haywire
1333087 travels the country every day talking to americans who are hurting feeling pain at the pump and worrying about how theyll pay their mortgage
1333088 tendency to overestimate the severity of economic problems and underestimate the recent past present and future performance of the economy
1333089 will turn out to be mere footnotes in a longer term march of progress
1333090 only about a quarter of our waking hours are consumed with work down from 45 percent in 1950
1333091 data points add up to steady continuing progress for average americans
1333092 life of human societies international cooperation human rights security and peace and living peacefully together
1333093 dialogue in the face of calls for the clash of civilizations and end of history
1333094 efforts of states and international organizations in augmenting dialogue and overcoming its obstacles
1333095 media and its impact on disseminating the culture of dialogue and co existance
1333096 openness and willingness to cooperate with the international community it marks a new direction for saudi arabia whose wahhabi islam has come in for criticism internationally
1333097 saudi arabia on whose ground the global message of islam was launched affirms to the whole world its openness and cooperation with the world community
1333098 islam requires muslims to inform people about islam as the final divine message that came after the previous prophets
1333099 we are just a couple of old ladies who wouldnt hurt children and we are certainly not paedophiles
1333100 im sorry if we have caused any offence on this occasion
1333101 we have to walk a fine line between protecting the children who use this popular paddling pool and the interests of the community as a whole
1333102 a lot of people are more concerned about the safety of their children these days so it is appropriate that our staff are aware of who is taking photos
1333103 believed that the world was in a stage of decadence degeneracy and decay comparable to rome
1333104 we dreamed of a new age born of violent insurrection we danced on the graves of the war dead in vietnam every corpse was ammunition for our side
1333105 on her thirtieth birthday at the farm she had changed her name to lilly stillwater and adopted the calm organic lifestyle that ought to have gone with it only to be deeply disrupted shortly after by the growth of a consuming passion for the music of tina turner
1333106 we used to think money was the least important thing now i can see that its the most important
1333107 the error was i think imagining that there was somewhere new to go someone new to be it became increasingly clear that a closed system of myth did not jibe with the world as it really was
1333108 a system formed less from malice than from a kind of natural order less from inordinate greed than from longings much like our own for privacy comfort individual freedom and ones familiar or chosen way of life
1333109 have you noticed that we have had to make compromises find ways to support our visions create a framework in this difficult world through which to live and to survive
1333110 such as it may be and my thing goes on and on and on
1333111 the united states israel and some of their european allies have begun to recognize that their policy of trying to defeat their enemies by isolating and vilifying them has failed
1333112 is in stark contrast to what arab moderates could show for in the same decade they spent negotiating with the israeli state
1333113 i was driving on the main road when suddenly the tractor hit me in the rear on the right hand side
1333114 he made a u turn and rammed the windows twice with the shovel the third time he aimed for my head he came up to my window and death was staring me in the eyes
1333115 fortunately i was able to swerve to the right onto a small side street otherwise i would have gone to meet my maker
1333116 the right of juries to judge the justice of laws
1333117 the theory of government is that it is formed by the voluntary contract of the people individually with each other
1333118 if only ten per cent of the people were of this sort more than sixty four per cent of the juries would include one or more of these men to prevent a conviction in order that there should be an even chance of twelve men taken at random being unanimously willing to judge according to certain principles it is necessary that there be not so many as six per cent of the population who reject those principles
1333119 where it has been reasonably said that certainty is sometimes more important than justice
1333120 d efensive associations will have their judges and their treaties as to the method of arbitration when two associations are on opposite sides of a case and these tribunals of one or three professional judges will settle all cases where some one does not distinctly demand a jury i suppose a case will almost never come before a jury except on appeal
1333121 1 do you agree with the charges levelled against you by the immigrant council of ireland namely that the article can be seen as inspiring racial hatred why why not
1333122 2 do you agree that your article could be misunderstood in some quarters if so then what is the main idea of it and what was it really trying to say
1333123 3 do you agree that some of the statements you made could be offensive to people from africa who live in ireland did you think about them when writing the piece
1333124 4 its definately sic not the first time that your writing offended somebody can you recall any other instances official complaints death threats etc that you got from say the irish republicans
1333125 that is all it would be great if you could answer these questions or give your comment in any way you wish i just want to add that there are a lot of africans associated with metro eireann and theyre all very offended so well have to run comments from the african community aid groups etc and it would be really great to have your comment to balance all of that
1333126 this reform will help to ensure that access to the uk benefits system for workers from other countries including nationals from other european economic area states is limited to those who have a connection with and have made a contribution to the uk
1333127 instead the longer people claim the more we will expect in return
1333128 we will help people find work but they will be expected to take a job
1333129 contradict the full enjoyment of womens reproductive health rights that are protected by cedaw
1333130 discriminatory to refuse to legally provide reproductive health services to women
1333131 must refrain from obstructing women from pursuing their health goals
1333132 compelling look at the most impactful sic and influential cultural movements of the past thirty years
1333133 a kid from the projects who went to yale and married a doctor im a person who fits in everywhere and nowhere
1333134 it is the highest impertinence and presumption in ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of private people and to restrain their expense
1333135 they are themselves always and without any exception the greatest spendthrifts in the society
1333136 it was like gardeners going round pulling up their plants all the time to see whether the roots are still there
1333137 its not what theyre doing to us its what were not doing
1333138 but for all the talk of systemic racism and governmental screw ups we must look at ourselves and understand our own responsibility
1333139 there are more doors of opportunity open for black people today than ever before in the history of america
1333140 there are forces that make the effort to escape poverty difficult
1333141 when people tell you you cant get up youre a victim
1333142 thats when you know it is the devil youre hearing
1333143 in the neighborhood that most of us grew up in parenting is not going on
1333144 you have the pile up of these sweet beautiful things born by nature raised by no one
1333145 have difficulty showing a son how to be a man
1333146 we wonder if much of these kids rage was born when their fathers abandoned them
1333147 drugs alcohol shoplifting gangbanging hustling i was in and out of jail
1333148 i was angry i would fight at the drop of a dime
1333149 pulled the covers over her head and left her son standing mutely behind the curtain
1333150 are giving up their main responsibility to look after their children
1333151 many black parents use physical punishment not just spanking but also hitting slapping and beating kids with objects
1333152 many black parents have told us that physical punishment is part of black culture
1333153 when they beat their kids they are sending a message that it is okay to use violence to resolve conflicts
1333154 beat their kids not to discipline them but to exorcise their own demons they take their anger out on the child
1333155 serves as a whupping object for peevish adults these beatings often produce angry children who treat others as violently as they have been treated
1333156 words like youre stupid youre an idiot im sorry you were born or youll never amount to anything can stick a dagger in a childs heart
1333157 if they hear their mom say black men aint worth s the boys wonder whether that includes them when their moms yell youre no good just like your father all the doubt goes away
1333158 a lover or some crack or if nothing else a bag of burgers
1333159 black men have tried to maintain their dignity and to keep control of their anger is by being cool many who feel abandoned by a parent protect themselves from being hurt by putting on a cool detachment
1333160 what the hell good is brown v board of education if nobody wants it
1333161 but you can make the best use of what you have to get the best you can for your child
1333162 talking and reading to infants and children help lay down the physical structures in the brain to develop skills in language
1333163 teachers report that in poor neighborhoods children often begin school not knowing their colors or the letters of the alphabet
1333164 sharp eyed teachers can identify the children who will become high school dropouts the day they walk in the kindergarten door
1333165 you have a choice as to whether to have children or not
1333166 both of you are supposed to have something to do with that child for the rest of its life
1333167 five or six different children same woman eight ten different husbands or whatever
1333168 grandmother mother and great grandmother in the same room raising children and the child knows nothing about love or respect of any one of the three of them
1333169 we imagine them thirty or forty years down the road wandering around just as aimlessly and we want to cry
1333170 is not in the right wing hes not clarence thomas he is not ward connerly
1333171 we should not permit our grievances to overshadow our opportunities
1333172 said he wanted above all else to get black people to shed the idea that they did not control their destiny
1333173 education was a radical tool of liberation for black people so recently enslaved and purposely denied the chance to learn
1333174 very few new ideas are allowed into this stifling echo chamber
1333175 the official message from civil rights leaders remains the same black people are victims of the system and the government needs to increase social spending even the most dysfunctional and criminal behavior among black people is not to be criticized by black leaders
1333176 be denied and hidden in the name of protecting the image of blacks as disadvantaged oppressed and perpetually victimized
1333177 there are people who want you to remain in a hole and they rejoice in your hopelessness because they have jobs mismanaging you
1333178 saw political opportunity in making themselves masters of large pools of black people dependent on state and federal poverty programs
1333179 cultural belief that being authentically black does not allow for high quality intellectual engagement in school
1333180 would discomfort the teachers among its supporters it will inevitably be viewed as having missed the most important civil rights battle of the last half century
1333181 police brutality and the increasing number of black people in jail
1333182 on having black people take personal responsibility for the exorbitant amount of crime committed by black people against other black people
1333183 ive never once heard the naacp say lets do something about this
1333184 do the risks we face provide justification for such a scheme in the first place do we want the state to have details of more and more aspects of our private lives
1333185 whatever the benefits would such a scheme amount to excessive surveillance would this be a step too far for the british way of life
1333186 one hundred years ago it took just over three weeks for australians to produce all the wealth needed to pay for all the state and federal government services for a whole year today this takes almost four months
1333187 people who freely admit they cannot be trusted to run their own lives should presumably not be trusted to run other peoples either dependent children have a right to be looked after but they cannot claim the full range of freedoms that adults expect likewise those who declare themselves incompetent to organise their own lives should not expect to exercise all the rights that autonomous and responsible citizens take for granted
1333188 fascist state where we all salute the logo and have little opportunity for criticism because our newspapers television stations internet servers streets and retail spaces are all controlled by multinational corporate interests
1333189 probably the most influential person under the age of 35 in the world
1333190 naomi klein might just be helping re invent politics for a new generation
1333191 the elimination of the public sphere total liberation for corporations and skeletal social spending
1333192 this is a tragedy it is also an opportunity to radically reform the education system
1333193 national health insurance will probably come to the united states in the wake of a major change in the political climate the kind of change that often accompanies a war a depression or large scale civil unrest
1333194 prays for crisis the way drought stricken farmers pray for rain
1333195 its clear that chile never was the laboratory of pure free markets that its cheerleaders claimed
1333196 some of the most infamous human rights violations of this era
1333197 which have tended to be viewed as sadistic acts carried out by antidemocratic regimes were in fact either committed with the deliberate intent of terrorizing the public or actively harnessed to prepare the ground for the introduction of radical freemarket reforms
1333198 the nato attack on belgrade in 1999 created the conditions for rapid privatizations in the former yugoslavia a goal that predated the war
1333199 israeli corporations were tired of being held back by war
1333200 be perfectly positioned to be the middle easts free trade hub
1333201 the flipping of israels export economy from one based on traditional goods and high technology to one disproportionately dependent on selling expertise and devices related to counterterrorism
1333202 the rapid expansion of the high tech security economy created a powerful appetite inside israels wealthy and most powerful sectors for abandoning peace in favor of fighting a continual and continuously expanding war on terror
1333203 had unleashed ferocious violence because they could not crack open the closed economies of the middle east by peaceful means
1333204 saddams use of chemical weapons on his own people made him easy to hate
1333205 saddam did not pose a threat to u s security
1333206 but he did pose a threat to u s energy companies since he had recently signed contracts with a russian oil giant and was in negotiations with frances total
1333207 washington abandoned its democratic promises and instead ordered increases in the shock level
1333208 had little to do with anti saddamism and everything to do with free market fervor
1333209 the fact that exactly the same errors as those made in iraq were instantly repeated in new orleans
1333210 should put to rest the claim that iraqs occupation was merely a string of mishaps and mistakes marked by incompetence and lack of oversight
1333211 100 million worth of damage to iraqs national airline which was one of the first assets to be put on the auction block in an early and contentious partial privatization
1333212 key bush officials have maintained their interests in the disaster capitalism complex
1333213 allowing them to simultaneously profit from the disasters they help unleash
1333214 when he leaves office in 2009 and is able to cash in his halliburton holdings
1333215 cheney will have the opportunity to profit extravagantly from the stunning improvement in halliburtons fortunes
1333216 not seldom has it seemed as if some eminent neoconservatives mistook tel aviv for the capital of the united states
1333217 the means to fight injustice and to turn fear against those who prey on the fearful
1333218 your parents death wasnt your fault it was your fathers fault
1333219 his crime was appalling yes but it was motivated not by greed but by desperation
1333220 if only we had been running the show things would have turned out differently
1333221 communism has not been tried and found wanting it has been found difficult and thus never tried
1333222 i will sit in my front door with my shotgun
1333223 its not the city that determines we are going to build
1333224 i cant ask the city to get everything lined up and only then ill come home
1333225 on october 19 and told the representative we need electricity
1333226 he said he needed to justify the load because he couldnt take power from populated areas
1333227 vien brought a list of 500 enough to get the power back on
1333228 we are done with recovery and are now working on development
1333229 the driving force for most families was getting kids into some semblance of order
1333230 evacuated neighbors many living an hour or more away also drew reassurance from lakeviews first baptist church which put up a map in early 2006 so that residents could stick a pin over their blocks to declare that they were committed to coming home
1333231 people were coming out of the woodwork to see what they could do to help
1333232 we cluster homes do three four five houses on the same street
1333233 moral ethical philosophical or psychological expression that questions homosexual practices
1333234 a priest a pastor a teacher or even an average citizen who says in a sermon a classroom or public conversation that homosexual acts are sinful disordered or an illness could be denounced and detained
1333235 perhaps the most perverse disease impregnated in the human head
1333236 it was as if the gays were playing them like a violin
1333237 was just a sort of murmur and that was it
1333238 ill tell you theres no more democracy in massachusetts no constitutional government they were completely being run by the homosexual lobby
1333239 the general population would never vote for that the extent to which the state senate just rolled over for the homosexual lobby is absolutely breathtaking
1333240 you would have thought they would have at least had a debate
1333241 the recent events in california have apparently energized the homosexual lobby they apparently persuaded sen robert creedon d brockton senate chairman of the judiciary committee to take the unusual step of resurrecting it from the study to be voted on creedon normally a pro life moderately pro family senator isnt running for re election this fall according to press reports sen diane wilkerson d mattapan who led the charge to push for huge taxpayer funding for homosexual programs in the schools is the major force behind this also
1333242 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
1333243 this would allow any homosexual couple in america to get married here in massachusetts and cause havoc in their home states
1333244 this would make massachusetts a sort of mecca for gay weddings and there will be instability around the country
1333245 the loss of 15 20 million people might have been justified
1333246 dominated by the decision of the u s government in 2001 to assert a single handed world hegemony denouncing hitherto accepted international conventions reserving its right to launch wars of aggression or other military operations whenever it wanted to and actually doing so
1333247 enabled a group of political crazies to realize long held plans for an unaccompanied solo performance of world supremacy
1333248 were formally denounced by president bush in 2002 namely that in principle sovereign states acting officially respected one anothers borders and kept out of one anothers internal affairs
1333249 the currently fashionable free market globalization has brought about a dramatic growth in economic and social inequalities both within states and internationally
1333250 this surge of inequality especially in the conditions of extreme economic instability such as those created by the global free market in the 1990s
1333251 is at the roots of the major social and political tensions of the new century
1333252 kept at bay both the danger of a global war and the collapse of large parts of the globe into disorder or anarchy
1333253 a number probably a growing number of these political entities appear incapable of carrying on the essential functions of territorial states or are threatened with disintegration by secessionist movements
1333254 rebellion against serbia of an extremist minority group among albanian nationalists in kosovo
1333255 unlike britain and all other european states america never saw itself as one entity in an international system of rival political powers
1333256 britain certainly had a strong conviction of its superiority to other societies but absolutely no messianic belief in or particular desire for the conversion of other peoples to the british ways of government
1333257 lifelong devotion to communism destroyed him as a thinker or interpreter of events
1333258 we can only hire individuals for these jobs if vacancies are available
1333259 we are not setting quotas and were not planning to hire someone who is qualified just because they are a minority or female but we know we have to take some affirmative steps and develop a diversified workforce
1333260 i dont want to use the expression wine and dine but i gave them a good time
1333261 we had jobs we needed them filled and we hired qualified people
1333262 obviously the supreme court decision delivers a significant blow to our opponents
1333263 it does send a very strong message to our opponents that they wont be able to evade democracy which is what theyve been trying to do by going to the court system
1333264 theyve been trying to keep the ballot issue away from the people of california
1333265 the people of california back in 2000 by more than a 61 percent majority upheld the definition of marriage as one man and one woman i believe they will do so again
1333266 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
1333267 the same sex marriage advocates were seeking to remove the amendment from the november ballot erroneously arguing that the rules for revising the california constitution were not properly followed their brief claimed that an initiative was not enough to put the amendment on the ballot since it must also be approved by two thirds of the legislature the suit also alleged that petitions for the initiative which were circulated prior to the ruling legalizing same sex marriage were misleading because they stated the amendment would not change existing law and would not have a financial impact on the state
1333268 if the people have an opportunity to participate in the democratic process they will vote for marriage as one man and one woman
1333269 those who push for same sex marriage are willing to destroy both marriage and democracy to achieve a selfish result marriage between a man and a woman is best for our children and for our country
1333270 theyre suggesting the supreme court can rewrite the entire institution of marriage but people cant amend the constitution to go back to its historical definition
1333271 its absolutely ridiculous to argue that courts can turn society upside down in 30 days but the people have no right to define it
1333272 the peoples overwhelming support to protect the longstanding meaning of marriage as between a man and a woman has been staggering the california marriage amendment will allow the people of california not politicians or judges to reaffirm the definition of marriage by placing it in the constitution
1333273 the bbc will let vicar gags pass but they would not let imam gags pass
1333274 despite jesus words in johns gospel christianity has been promoted at the point of the sword and legally supported by extreme sanctions despite the quranic axiom islam has been supported in the same way with extreme penalties for abandoning it and civil disabilities for those outside the faith
1333275 there is no religious tradition whose history is exempt from such temptation and such failure
1333276 what we need as a vision for our dialogue is to break the current cycles of violence to show the world that faith and faith alone can truly ground a commitment to peace which definitively abandons the tempting but lethal cycle of retaliation in which we simply imitate each others violence
1333277 your letter could hardly be more timely given the growing awareness that peace throughout the world is deeply entwined with the ability of all people of faith everywhere to live in peace justice mutual respect and love
1333278 have a go incidents which included chasing and restraining muggers near his south london home opposition leaders said it offered nothing new and was merely the latest policy designed to appeal to core tory voters
1333279 this is a typical labour con it will give no greater protection to householders confronted by burglars because its nothing more than a re statement of the existing case law
1333280 the justice system must not only work on the side of people who do the right thing as good citizens but also be seen to work on their side
1333281 the government strongly supports the right of law abiding people to defend themselves their families and their property with reasonable force this law will help to make sure that that right is upheld and that the criminal justice system is firmly weighted in favour of the victim
1333282 dealing with crime is not just the responsibility of the police courts and prisons its the responsibility of all of us
1333283 these changes in the law will make clear victims of crime and those who intervene to prevent crime should be treated with respect by the justice system we do not want to encourage vigilantism but there can be no justice in a system which makes the victim the criminal
1333284 within three hours it if requires policing intervention or three days if there is less immediate need for a police presence
1333285 programs which make special efforts to help minorities get ahead
1333286 to use religion as a reason to refuse blind and disabled passengers is unjustified
1333287 guidance for local authorities on community cohesion contingency planning and tension monitoring
1333288 our priority is to ensure we do not see more and more stretches of the nations high streets turned into bland every towns where every high street has the same shops the same look and the same sterile feel
1333289 we plan to give councils more scope to curb clone town britain and to block large out of town developments we know there are currently tougher times on the high street
1333290 these plans could take away the rights of local authorities to resist large supermarkets on the grounds of need
1333291 these changes are being driven by gordon brown and will ultimately hit small retailers and worsen the problem of ghost town britain a surge in out of town development will not be environmentally sustainable and will hinder urban regeneration
1333292 i believe that the strengthened rules will guide future town centre development by giving councils the tools to attract investment and protect and promote their high streets
1333293 it is an attempt to squash competition and dominate the catchment area
1333294 say no to fascism no racism no discrimination with an occasional anarchy symbol tossed in for good measure the protesters marched enveloped in this sonic tidal wave filled with self congratulation for the righteous stand that they had taken racism in vienna
1333295 everyone is essentially the same and wants the same thing
1333296 the large scale presence of muslims in the countries of western europe has led to a situation for the indigenous infidels that is far more unpleasant expensive and physically dangerous than would be the case without such a large scale presence
1333297 there has been a sea change on maternity leave and flexible work and we welcome that
1333298 but the effect has been to reinforce some traditional patterns the work and families act has not freed parents and given them real choice it is based on assumptions and some of the terms reinforce the traditional pattern of women as the carers of children
1333299 we have come a long way but after winning all these gains it is worth asking are we still on the right track the thing i worry about is that the current legislation and regulations have had the unintended consequence of making women a less attractive prospect to employers
1333300 the way it is framed means it is up to the women to transfer the leave to the man it is not his right
1333301 of course there is a business case for these changes and many companies are going further
1333302 but this is a social argument as well as an economic one there may well be a cost to business but as a society we are already thinking in terms of wellbeing as well as take home pay
1333303 under eu law employment rights once given cannot be taken away so there is no point regretting past decisions
1333304 the government should both better protect pregnant workers and introduce paid parental leave that supports mums and dads to share care
1333305 around the world christians are being increasingly targeted and even persecuted for their religious beliefs now one of the largest organizations in the united nations is pushing to make a bad situation even worse by promoting anti christian bigotry
1333306 we must put an immediate end to this most recent dangerous attack on faith that attempts to criminalize christianity
1333307 which states that all rights are subject to sharia law and makes sharia law the only source of reference for human rights
1333308 the position of the eclj in regards to the issue of defamation of religion resolutions as they have been introduced at the u n human rights council and general assembly is that they are in direct violation of international law concerning the rights to freedom of religion and expression
1333309 the defamation of religion resolutions establish as the primary focus and concern the protection of ideas and religions generally rather than protecting the rights of individuals to practice their religion which is the chief purpose of international religious freedom law
1333310 furthermore defamation of religion replaces the existing objective criterion of limitations on speech where there is an intent to incite hatred or violence against religious believers with a subjective criterion that considers whether the religion or its believers feel offended by the speech
1333311 what should be most disconcerting to the international community is that laws based on the concept of defamation of religion actually help to create a climate of violence
1333312 to prevent participants in an online chat room from posting or submitting harassing comments that blasphemed and defamed plaintiffs islamic religion
1333313 the implementation of domestic laws to combat defamation of religion in many oic countries reveals a selective and arbitrary enforcement toward religious minorities who are often christians those violations are frequently punishable by the death penalty
1333314 which condemned the growing trend of islamophobia and systematic discrimination against adherents of islam
1333315 in which the organization expressed concern at the systematically negative stereotyping of muslims and islam and other divine religions
1333316 adequate protection against acts of hatred discrimination intimidation and coercion resulting from the defamation of any religion
1333317 islam has been the subject of very deep campaign of defamation
1333318 theyre attempting to pass a sinister resolution that is nothing more than blatant religious bigotry
1333319 this is very important to understand this radical proposal would outlaw christianity it would make the proclamation of your faith an international crime
1333320 in his recent dissent on the supreme courts ruling on guantanamo bay justice scalia said america is at war with radical islamists never has this rung more true than today never have christians been more targeted for their religious beliefs and never have we faced a more dangerous threat than the one posed by the oic
1333321 the united nations 160 cannibals and 17 civilized people taking a majority vote on what to have for dinner
1333322 this resolution is incomplete inasmuch as it fails to address the situation of all religions
1333323 we believe that such inclusive language would have furthered the objective of promoting religious freedom we also believe that any resolution on this topic must include mention of the need to change educational systems that promote hatred of other religions as well as the problem of state sponsored media that negatively targets any one religion
1333324 funding evil how terrorism is financed and how to stop it
1333325 the values of free speech and individual reputation are both significant and it is not surprising that different nations would place different emphasis on each

1333340 thaymon earl watson 19 was sentenced to 14 years in prison for stabbing to death a 19 year old in december 2006 at a gresham transit station
1333341 when police showed up they saw several people running from the bus and heard several shots fired

1333349 the couple is exempt from paying the 2 283 yearly council tax bill on their home
1333350 this is britain gone mad just what in the world is this country coming to when the police arrest people like me for protecting their own property
1333351 the police say they want to reduce crime yet they let evil little toe rags like this off
1333352 there is simply no way we can shake off this problem of yob britain if the legal system fails to protect the everyday person
1333353 my wife called the police at 6pm but they just kept on throwing stones through my back gate
1333354 i left the back door open to stop them smashing it
1333355 the police turned up just as i was chasing them as a result i was arrested but they didnt arrest any of them
1333356 criminal past when applying for a post as a welfare assistant at her local primary school
1333357 its crazy that i have to be crb checked before i can ride in a taxi with my own son
1333358 i have to be checked to go in a taxi with him but if i was able to drive him myself they wouldnt care and even offered to pay me expenses
1333359 the taxi company is great and they carry alexs medication but they wont use it and they wouldnt know how to put him in the recovery position if needs be
1333360 the crb checking is a requirement of our transport provisions in relation to adults travelling on home to school transport in the capacity of an escort
1333361 this is a standard requirement and has been for several years
1333362 any adult acting as an escort will in the public gaze be viewed as acting with the full acquiescence of the council and hence with its implied authority
1333363 for the protection of the council and all vulnerable persons in its care its essential all those endowed with an authority implicit or explicit should meet the security requirements within the transport contract provisions
1333364 under the direction of ian crane chief ranger of independence national historical park supervising ranger alan saperstein repeatedly approached marcavage to demand that he and the ministry team move to a free speech zone on the other side of the liberty bell center which was nowhere near those entering or exiting
1333365 on june 13 2008 judge rapoport found michael marcavage guilty on both charges under the code of federal regulations
1333366 all laws repugnant to the constitution are void of law
1333367 when the nazis came for the communists i did not speak out because i was not a communist when they came for the trade unionists i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist when they came for the catholics i did not speak out because i was a not a catholic when they came for the jews i did not speak out because i was a not a jew then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me
1333368 she has adopted a radical practice of her religion incompatible with essential values of the french community particularly the principle of equality of the sexes
1333369 she lives almost as a recluse isolated from french society
1333370 she has no idea about the secular state or the right to vote she lives in total submission to her male relatives she seems to find this normal and the idea of challenging it has never crossed her mind
1333371 if you follow that to its logical conclusion it means that women whose partners beat them are also not worthy of being french
1333372 the effect of violating ms ladeles dignity or creating an intimidating hostile degrading humiliating or offensive environment
1333373 placed a greater value on the rights of the lesbian gay bisexual and transsexual community than it placed on the rights of ms ladele as one holding an orthodox christian belief
1333374 i felt harassed and victimised i was being picked on on a daily basis
1333375 this is a victory for religious liberty not just for myself but for others in a similar position gay rights should not be used as an excuse to bully and harass people over their religious beliefs
1333376 this decision underlines that despite some recent claims to the contrary freedom of religious conscience must be protected by law in the same way as any other human right
1333377 we would call on local politicians to take note and live up to the challenge of this benchmark decision
1333378 public servants are paid by taxpayers to deliver public services they shouldnt be able to pick and choose who they deliver those services to doubtless 40 years ago there were moral objections to mixed race marriages quite rightly such objections would no longer be entertained
1333379 lillian ladele claims she was won a victory for religious liberty no she has not she has won a victory for the right to discriminate
1333380 not be welcomed by all communities because there was a dog on the cards
1333381 if muslims dont like dogs then they should go and live where there are none we must stop bending over backwards to please these people they certainly wouldnt do it for us enough is enough
1333382 us english is to hispanics as the ku klux klan is to blacks
1333383 it is like the veil it is a symbol of non integration we hope that this initiative sends a clear signal that we are calling a halt to the islamisation of switzerland our hard won individual liberties are being eroded and that is not acceptable
1333384 many women even socialists signed this petition because not one swiss woman can tolerate the way that muslim men treat their wives
1333385 deep rooted cultural resistance within swiss society to the multiculturalisation process
1333386 the growing prevalence of racist and xenophobic stances in political programmes and discourse particularly during elections and various votes
1333387 as part of the consultation concerns were expressed by the councils lesbian gay and bisexual group and a small number of other consultees that this action was potentially discriminating against gay and bisexual men whose activities on this part of the downs were objected to by other members of the local community and downs users
1333388 the general public are unhappy about people taking part in lewd behaviour in public spaces whether its between men and women or people of the same sex
1333389 we are working together with the terence higgins trust to make sure any work we will do is sensitive
1333390 were making sure people know what we are doing so we are not seen to be discriminating
1333391 how can it be discriminatory to clear land that might stop what is an illegal practice
1333392 i find it offensive to suggest that by taking this action which might stop people collecting to carry out what some might describe as illegal acts and certainly offensive behaviour you are being discriminatory
1333393 last year saw 250 people arrested throughout the force for offences including outraging public decency to kerb crawling
1333394 unfortunately there is a minority of people who partake in sexual acts in public places in certain areas which are not only against the law but are also offensive to members of the public
1333395 i was on castro and 18th at 9 30 p m
1333396 and there was someone shouting jesse helms is dead to which everyone in earshot burst into applause and cheering myself included
1333397 there seemingly wasnt a right wing retrograde social issue helms met that he didnt like
1333398 it was his unmitigated intolerance toward people of color that will define his legacy
1333399 symbol of the evil against which all enlightened people are automatically ranged
1333400 i think he ought to be worried about whats going on in the good lords mind
1333401 because if there is retributive justice hell get aids from a transfusion or one of his grandchildren will get it
1333402 deserves to be remembered as one of a handful of men who brought white southern conservatives into a new era of race relations
1333403 anti integration anti martin luther king commentaries on wral tv
1333404 very revolutionary for southern white populists he accepted the laws and obeyed them
1333405 well i dont go around slinging racial epithets or fuming with hatred at this or that group therefore i cant be one of those awful people why some of my best friends
1333406 so is this particular instance bad racism or sorta understandable racism
1333407 frostfrench is a multicultural company with a strong commitment to racial equality
1333408 frostfrench wont appeal the decision and cannot comment further due to legalities
1333409 i must stress that sadie and jemima are deeply upset that the frostfrench label has been drawn into something like this both are huge campaigners for racial equality
1333410 the panel has concluded that a presumption in favour of a community order is most likely to be appropriate in relation to the less serious offences of theft and dishonesty burglary and motoring offences where there may be clear advantages in requiring an offender to serve a sentence in the community
1333411 work against those who are already disadvantaged by being unemployed
1333412 this is hilarious the american sotuhwest is filled with racist rednecks who love spicy mexican food but hate mexicans
1333413 the mob began to advance throwing sticks and rocks at the officers crowd control tactics were used to keep moving through the group of rainbows
1333414 this lawless behavior is unacceptable and we will not tolerate it
1333415 the safety of our employees public and rainbow participants is our number one priority and we will continue to protect everyone on the national forest
1333416 arrowcorps5 is the largest most complex most challenging conservation project ever conceived by the order of the arrow and boy scouts of america
1333417 this project provides a once in a lifetime opportunity for each participant to set an example of leadership in service to those who treasure our national forests
1333418 it appears the rainbow group has managed to intimidate an entire federal agency
1333419 they couldnt be expelled without a fairly significant amount of law enforcement activity
1333420 theyve been through the planning process and have been working very cooperatively with our forest service
1333421 they did everything legally they had their permits but because of the fact undersecretary rey for whatever reason took it on himself to do what he has referred to as an experimental process by which he does not require the rainbow group to have any permit the conflict developed
1333422 these people deliberately for hours were aggressively working the camp over and working the people over
1333423 they chose the kiddie village the one place the kids to take their stand and create a riot and i bought into it they were looking for an excuse to do some damage to us
1333424 a substantial similarity between nazism and the political order that prevails in algeria
1333425 the line separating nazism from islamism is a thin one
1333426 at easter we avoid foil wrapped chocolate eggs by having our kids paint hard boiled eggs and stones for my daughters sixth birthday last year we took a tribe of children on a nearby bushwalk and had a rubbish collecting competitions
1333427 at least three of the following colours red green yellow blue purple and white
1333428 a view was put forward that this type of approach to policy and program implementation would risk the notion of a nanny state and overrestriction of behaviour
1333429 it was felt that health promotion must not succumb to these pressures
1333430 abolishing cigarettes and alcohol brought into the country duty free
1333431 more stairs in workplaces to encourage people to avoid using the escalators
1333432 to join in compulsory exercises following the instructions given by a woman from the telescreen
1333433 half an hour of physical activity be built into sedentary jobs
1333434 theres one law for everybody and thats all there is to be said and anything else that commands your loyalty or allegiance is completely irrelevant in the processes of the courts i think thats a bit of a danger
1333435 would be in tension with the english legal tradition on questions like monogamy provisions for divorce the rights of women custody of children laws of inheritance and of evidence
1333436 british law should be based on british values and determined by the british parliament
1333437 but there could be more to do maybe some more baseball and some football there just needs to be more to do
1333438 kids are out of school and dont have anything constructive to do
1333439 a lot of kids and young adults have a lot of free time and little supervision during the summer
1333440 and the saying goes idle time is the devils workshop the more time on their hands the more ways they will find to get into mischief with their friends
1333441 there may be some things out there but they arent affordable to the kids that have the greatest need who are at the greatest risk
1333442 and another problem is a lack of transportation to those activities
1333443 i would like to see more partnerships between the sheriffs office and other organizations
1333444 we have all these school buildings and if we could give them something to do there it would be convenient to get there help build school pride and create activities to keep kids off the street and in a safe environment
1333445 we are trying to do a better job with partnering with other agencies and developing some good quality programming
1333446 not every child that needs programs can get to the ymca
1333447 every program the ymca offers it may just seem like playing basketball has a set of core values we believe in
1333448 they are all geared towards caring respect responsibility and honesty
1333449 we feel at the ymca that you start with strong kids and that builds strong families which then builds strong communities
1333450 we think it is important that kids have something constructive to do
1333451 when it gets hot people are more restless and out more and kids arent in school so you see more of these crimes
1333452 as police and detectives we cant solve everything all by ourselves
1333453 we need the publics help if you see a suspicious act call the police if your neighbor is out of town keep an eye on things
1333454 the more recreation we have the more it would help the juvenile criminal problem
1333455 and this spike in crime isnt limited to one area its all over the city in every community crime does not discriminate
1333456 denver singers black national anthem switcheroo was a risky act for obama and black americans
1333457 heaven only knows what black denver singer rene marie was thinking when she stood at the microphone and belted out the lyrics of the black national anthem instead of the agreed on star spangled banner the event was denver mayor john hickenloopers annual state of the city address and confab marie was engaged at no pay to sing the customary opening star spangled banner the black national anthem penned by civil rights legend and songwriter james weldon johnson a century ago is a beautiful lilting and powerful expression of black pride and dignity it has been a virtual staple at any and every kind of black gathering down through the years and thats where its appropriate to sing it the denver mayors event wasnt maries tortured explanation for switching songs is take your pick it was a matter of artistic expression her way of showing her pride in being black a veiled protest against racial mistreatment and discrimination and her personal statement against the alleged racial hypocrisy of america her explanations are facile and self serving and just about everyone with an opinion on the issue appropriately blasted her and demanded a formal apology which she hasnt as yet given she should apologize publicly and do it now
1333458 her ill timed totally inappropriate act has been fodder for speculation that it could have a possible backdoor blowback on obama obama immediately rapped marie for her wrong headed switcheroo and said that theres only one national anthem obama had to move fast and knock the singers act the democratic convention will be in denver in august and obama can ill afford to have even the slightest hint that he approves anything that could be construed as an act that disrespects americas number one time tested emblematic expression of american patriotism especially from a black singer and even more especially given that colorado with a democratic controlled legislature and rising numbers of younger voters and hispanic voters could be ripe for the picking from the gop orbit in the fall the bigger reason is that obama more than any other presidential candidate in recent times is hyper sensitive to the patriotism issue republican rival john mccain has been scrupulously careful not to stoke any doubt about obamas patriotism but others have conservative websites chat rooms and some writers have feasted off impugning obamas patriotism they have slandered and ridiculed his name dumped on his wife michelle for her off the cuff repeatedly clarified in context comment about her lack of pride in america and the one time absence of an american flag from the lapel in his suits this line of attack cant be easily shrugged off as a below the belt slug by fringe ultra conservatives or professional political hit specialists despite his recent slog to the center even right on some positions obama is still widely regarded by moderates and conservatives as a liberal democrat
1333459 conservatives have long since seized the high ground on the issue of what is or isnt true patriotism and cast themselves as the protectors and defenders of the flag the national anthem and their read and interpretation of american traditions against the liberal defilers obama has one more albatross that white liberal democratic presidential contenders didnt have hes african american theres the inherent suspicion among some that african americans are eternal rebels and chronic social malcontents who undermine conventional american values and traditions its a short step from that false and bigoted notion to see blacks as less patriotic than white americans unfortunately this ridiculous tar of obama as somehow less of a true patriot because of who he is and what his votes and stances on the issues have been is not just a taint him in the minds of some those same minds tar blacks with the same broad unpatriotic brush marie was probably oblivious to the implications of her rash act in a follow up remarks she blithely blew it off as simply being a risky artistic act it was much more than that it was a risky act for obama and african americans
1333460 islamists in the west habitually say one thing to their english speaking audience and another thing to their arabic speaking audience
1333461 we the arab and islamic community gather here today to express our resentment at the celebrations by the jewish community and the evil jew jewish evil in britain
1333462 zionist racist website lies in order to justify its hate rhetoric while harrys place may not be known as a bastion of truth and balanced comment not even in the remotest sense of these words its latest blunder shows it as an entirely incompetent source of information
1333463 this particular blog space and its moderators are nonentities and insignificant however its danger lies in that in the past some corners of our mainstream media have picked up on its drivel and used it as fact
1333464 we are trying to ensure that police forces are aware of sensitivities that people can have with the dogs to make sure they are not going against any religious or cultural element within peoples homes it is being addressed and forces are working towards doing it
1333465 in islamic law the dog is not regarded as impure only its saliva is
1333466 i know in the muslim community there is a hang up against dogs but this is cultural also we know the british like dogs we muslims should do our bit to change our attitudes
1333467 the police are in effect being overly sensitive to potential criminals and not being sensitive enough to the public at large who need to be protected these sort of things have a counter productive effect because they cause huge friction between different communities
1333468 we would not condone any attempt to make search dogs wear special clothing which could cause them distress
1333469 some of l a s so called gangs are really no more than loose knit bands of blacks or latinos roaming the streets looking for people of the other color to shoot
1333470 bk all day im going to wipe all the bloods out
1333471 gangs are like a disease like a cancer in a community we have to do more
1333472 i think denzel washington and robert de niro and anyone who has made money glamorizing gang members should contribute to programs to help kids out of gangs
1333473 its not long before you have black on brown crime
1333474 a segment of our community the african american community is preying on them
1333475 they view police as a criminal gang and rightfully so and theyre afraid if they call the police someone in their family will be deported
1333476 if we dont get our arms around this problem organized gangs will fill the vacancies
1333477 there is no violence thats happened in this city that can compare to the violence that could take its place
1333478 i think this is happening all over right now all over the county
1333479 this has been happening for a while except people havent been talking because they were afraid this is nothing new
1333480 im asking for all bloods crips ms 13 everybody out there that represents something to put your weapons down and lets come to a table so we can talk peace
1333481 what im asking these leaders to do is if youve got one thats going to start trouble with the other dont let those two you know let it get physical
1333482 and if it does dont let it cause a war lets bring it to the attention of those leaders and let those leaders deal with their own
1333483 but only as it bore on the litigants of that case
1333484 this boycott is not about hiring homosexuals or homosexuals eating at mcdonalds or how homosexual employees are treated it is about mcdonalds as a corporation choosing to put the full weight of their organization behind promoting the homosexual agenda including homosexual marriage
1333485 ellis who is openly homosexual was given a seat on the nglcc board of directors
1333486 all our employees and customers with dignity and respect regardless of their ethnicity religious beliefs sexual orientation or any other differentiating factor
1333487 we are not telling mcdonalds who they can hire to work for the company nor are we demanding that they stop serving big macs to homosexual customers
1333488 this issue is about the worlds largest fast food chain allying itself and partnering with an organization that lobbies congress to enact laws that we feel can be used to repress religious freedom or undermine the sanctity of marriage
1333489 while one mcdonalds employee is affiliated with the national gay amp lesbian chamber of commerce nglcc mcdonalds is in no way aggressively promoting the homosexual agenda as suggested in the newsletter
1333490 to refer to richard ellis who is the vice president of communications for mcdonalds as one mcdonalds employee as if he is a teenager flipping hamburgers is disingenuous at best while aggressively is admittedly a subjective term afa believes that giving money to and partnering with a homosexual lobby organization is certainly an enthusiastic promotion of the homosexual agenda
1333491 as a christian organization the american family association always seeks to be honest accurate and completely forthright in the information we pass along to our supporters
1333492 we expect corporations in this country especially those that position themselves as family friendly businesses to do the same
1333493 mcdonalds is indeed a corporate partner and organizational ally of nglcc our vice president of u s communications richard ellis was recently elected to its board of directors
1333494 we are not currently planning corporate level contributions to lgbt groups
1333495 raise our sons in ignorance of or in contempt of the fatherland
1333496 there was never a war in all history easier to prevent by timely action
1333497 france though armed to the teeth is pacifist to the core
1333498 hitler tamed by prison released on parole he is expected to return to austria
1333499 few countries can afford the luxury of limiting their diplomacy to friendly countries and peace loving parties national security often requires negotiating with dangerous enemies
1333500 pro homosexual researchers conceal findings children raised by openly homosexual parents more likely to engage in homosexuality
1333501 love isnt enough five reasons why same sex marriage will harm children
1333502 its not appropriate to treat alcohol as though it belongs in a 2 shop mr munro said
1333503 this indicates that goverments should explore introducing aminimum price for alcohol
1333504 heavy drinkers will drink more as the price comes down he said
1333505 to be selling bottles of wine for less than 2 is going to encourage heavy drinkers and possibly underage people to consume more
1333506 the price will make wine much more attractive to young people and we need to monitor that situation given that alcopops have increased in price with the tax
1333507 but i would not recognise her if i saw her in australia because i never once saw her face
1333508 she called many times and tanya used to lock herself in her room and talk on her computer
1333509 whenever her mother called her we would try and comfort her we know how a mother feels in these sorts of situations my father would kiss her on the head and he said to her you are my daughter
1333510 a lady called saying she was from the australian embassy
1333511 she spoke arabic very well and said we respect your traditions and customs we would just like to make tanyas stay in gaza legal
1333512 i took her there myself and kissed her on the forehead as sheleft i waited there from 11 30am until 7pm we never saw her again
1333513 we have tried to call her many times but her family always says she is tired or sick
1333514 he tells us many times that we have destroyed his life
1333515 the main thing that is upsetting us is she is pregnant
1333516 if she wasnt we would say ok this happens in life
1333517 for a full month we were crying after she left she wanted to live in the apartment alone and culturally and islamicly we could not let her do that
1333518 another reason we were so proud of her was she was christian then became a muslim
1333519 we said to her your father has a farm and you are leaving australia to come here
1333520 she had no family here and she was deprived of her husband so we wanted very much to make her feel comfortable it was important that she have a good image of islam and how muslims treat people
1333521 to share and enjoy the life and love of a relationship that is not managed by fear and abuse especially not abuse that is cloaked in the name of any religion
1333522 as a muslim woman i am free from any abuse because of my religion islam it is because of my islam that i dont live infear of a husband that comes back every night to bash me untilim black and blue and then rape me
1333523 it is because of islam that i am empowered as a woman and not sexually exploited by man i dress for god and not for man
1333524 thats why i am one of many converts to islam and thats why islam is the fastest growing religion in the world amongst women
1333525 we have enjoyed the freedoms and rights of keeping our last names as we are not the property of our husbands we have had the right to vote before the womens liberation movement in the last century the right to keep our own money choose who i want to marry have the right to inheritance run a business the right to be protected and maintained by our husbands regardless of how rich i am
1333526 tanya would like to say that we have no comment to make regarding the alleged story
1333527 as the day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to god almighty it ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade with shews games sports guns bells bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more you will think me transported with enthusiasm but i am not i am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure that it will cost us to maintain this declaration and support and defend these states yet through all the gloom i can see the rays of ravishing light and glory i can see that the end is more than worth all the means and that posterity will tryumph in that days transaction even altho we should rue it which i trust in god we shall not
1333528 when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation
1333529 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government
1333530 we must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation
1333531 he has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good
1333532 declaration of the causes and necessities of taking up arms
1333533 were we directed from washington when to sow and when to reap we should soon want bread
1333534 do we mean the american war the revolution was effected before the war commenced the revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations this radical change in the principles opinions sentiments and affections of the people was the real american revolution
1333535 it is very hard to remember that events that are long in the past were once in the future

1333537 the clinton administration began to develop options to overthrow saddams regime
1333538 liberty for latin america how to undo five hundred years of state oppression
1333539 entrepreneurship as a source of economic growth and as a weapon against poverty is underappreciated
1333540 innovative thinking and alertness to opportunity is present in all societies indeed it is often found in unusual places
1333541 no central planner or development official would have chosen any of these people or business options as a tool to reduce poverty nonetheless all of these entrepreneurial activities have substantially upgraded the lives of millions of poor people
1333542 confiscation of property pollution of the currency bureaucratic corruption and inefficiency excessive taxation and unnecessary regulation
1333543 after half a century of failure foreign aid can no longer be the preferred tool for lifting the masses of africa and latin america out of their economic prostration
1333544 the fact that today millions of people manage to eke out a living in very creative ways under stifling bureaucracies elitist systems and despotic governments indicates that entrepreneurship is part of the human spirit and not the exclusive preserve of those countries that have generated astronomical wealth
1333545 many people fail to understand that an entrepreneur who discovers opportunity and transforms resources into wealth provides the most social service possible to the rest of the community even when that is not the original intention
1333546 with one hand covering his front the other his rear
1333547 in the western world we take supermarkets for granted many of us are in fact highly critical of these institutions but in extremely poor parts of the world such as kenya one would be hard pressed to find a more important source of human flourishing
1333548 this story helps us understand that the entrepreneurial spirit cannot be destroyed even when governments are providing a weak and perverse institutional environment
1333549 a government that will leave them alone to run their businesses and their lives
1333550 has led to the rise of a new class of farms growing fruit and vegetables in kenya
1333551 we should not allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good
1333552 most of them women with little or no education who have used their entrepreneurial drive to make a living and create wealth where there was previously only misery
1333553 were not a permanent solution but a private attempt to solve a public problem
1333554 opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work
1333555 america is worse than britain britain is worse than america and the soviet union is worse than both of them each one is worse than the other each one is more abominable than the other but today we are concerned with this malicious entity which is america

1333557 the past four decades championing the very freedoms that islam most opposes sexual and reproductive freedoms gay rights freedom from religion pornography and various forms of artistic transgression pacifism and so on
1333558 islam depends on community which places it in opposition to extreme individualism which threatens to fail in the west in addition the devout muslim is required to share his wealth with others the leftist also wants to see the strong help the weak
1333559 the progressive movement around the world and the muslims have the same enemies
1333560 the government practically permitted the left to operate since five years ago so that they would confront religious liberals
1333561 takes its language goals and aspirations as much from the crassest forms of marxism as it does from religion its leaders are as influenced by lenin sartre stalin and fanon as they are by the prophet
1333562 they should unite with the working class to destroy the capitalist system
1333563 a godsend to both sides the left a once dwindling band of communists trotskyites maoists and castroists had been clinging to the dregs of a clapped out cause the islamists could deliver numbers and passion but they needed a vehicle to give them purchase on the political terrain a tactical alliance became an operational imperative
1333564 the practical benefits of working together are enough to compensate for the differences
1333565 it made me wonder what she was doing the rest of the time
1333566 i thought it was a bit over the top rewarding her for something so routine but its part of a whole culture of stickers and smiley faces and celebration assemblies
1333567 children have gone from background to foreground in domestic life with more attention centred on them their upbringing and their small accomplishments
1333568 on visits to the homes of friends with small children one finds their toys strewn everywhere their drawings on the refrigerator television sets turned on to their shows parents seem little more than indentured servants
1333569 i tried ever so gently to tell them no one cared what they felt in essay courses many of these same students turned in papers upon which i wished to but did not write too much love in the home
1333570 at the weekends the kids are saying to us what are we doing today
1333571 said appleton who works part time for netmums an online network for mothers
1333572 the cushioning effect of awarding stickers and praise for inconsequential trivia masks what children really need and are looking for guidance consistency self reliance and love
1333573 because she was spelling the words how you said them
1333574 children have to learn im not saying it has to be negative but there has to be a balance when our kids go into the workplace they are in for a shock
1333575 i have got to go to london tomorrow and they havent even given me a map
1333576 here was someone working for a transport company who had spent three years at university who was aggrieved because he hadnt been given a detailed map
1333577 too many kids in london are growing up without boundaries without discipline and without the family structures they need
1333578 we should bring back discipline and the idea of punishment
1333579 positive psychology says count your blessings my kind of psychology says life can be hard and you have to learn to deal with it
1333580 im encouraging kids not to run away from stress but face up to it
1333581 its a way of reassuring ourselves that our children are going to be insulated from pain and adversity
1333582 we tell children they are wonderful now for tying their shoelaces or getting 50 in an exam but really its our way of flattering ourselves that were far more sensitive to children than people were in the past
1333583 youre subtly giving kids the message that they cant cope with life
1333584 i have a son of 12 and when he and his friends were just nine i remember being shocked at them using therapeutic language talking about being stressed out and depressed
1333585 it was telling students they could not cope before they started
1333586 since the sixties modern liberals have embraced anger as a sign of genuine commitment to the cause
1333587 three times more likely 17 percent to 6 percent to have actually done something to get back at someone who had hurt or offended them in the past month
1333588 twice as likely as conservatives to say it is okay to get welfare benefits they were not entitled to
1333589 tried to get a jewish charity to give him money while also receiving public assistance
1333590 an iq like qualifying test kerry had taken in 1966
1333591 why conservatives work harder feel happier have closer families take fewer drugs give more generously value honesty more are less materialistic and envious whine less and even hug their children more than liberals
1333592 has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups
1333593 the aesthetic of a giant minicab office sticky brown stained a bit pongy no pink no heels no make up no floral patterns no humanity
1333594 if gay marriage was ok and i was uncertain on the issue then i saw no reason in principle why a union should not be consecrated between three men as well as two men or indeed three men and a dog
1333595 this bigoted lying old etonian buffoon moneyed creep he has lied flagrantly flamboyantly to save his marriage despises people who are not of his class which means all of us a snobs london is a monday to thursday kind of affair behind fusty doors in clubs that only just let women in let alone plebs in restaurants that dont have prices on the menus in the regency offices of magazines whose only distinction is that all the staff are shagging each other
1333596 all irrational human hatreds are always really about your own feelings about yourself in some way anyway i think its all bollocks and the sooner we get over it the better
1333597 do we think she is 40 less intelligent less committed less hardworking less qualified its not the case its entrenched discrimination

1333599 a scene from a western when the room goes silent and tumbleweed blows across the foreground
1333600 adults are no longer trusted or expected to engage with children on their own initiative
1333601 when parents feel in need of official reassurance that other parents have passed the paedophile test before they even start on the pleasantries something has gone badly wrong in our communities
1333602 we should question whether there is anything healthy in a response where communities look at childrens own fathers with suspicion but would balk at helping a lost child find their way home
1333603 provide anything like a cast iron guarantee that children will be safe with a particular adult
1333604 all it tells us is that the person has not been convicted of an offence in the past
1333605 the adult qualities of spontaneous compassion and commitment are far more effective safeguarding methods than pieces of paper that promote the messages keep out and watch your back
1333606 i am likely to usher my wife forward if a child falls over in the street lest my picking up the child could be misinterpreted
1333607 and we need urgently to expose the nonsense of stranger danger and convince parents that although the risk of a child of theirs being abused at all is small that risk comes not from lurking strangers but from people known by their children often relatives who are able to exploit a childs trust
1333608 this liberal will be all about socializing uh uh would be about basically taking over and the government running all of your companies

1333671 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs that we are using on patrol
1333672 and if you look at the equipment we have seized it is clear to me the plan was to use these items for criminal purposes
1333673 we are very very worried about the intentions of a number of hardcore protesters which we believe are around 150 who are committed to using criminal means to achieve their aims
1333674 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process it is vital that david cameron takes action to determine why watford conservatives failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated

1333686 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the history of russia he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1333687 its a shame that not all young people understand how important he is the young people of russia today understand less and less
1333688 the young know he wrote important books about the camps and that he received the nobel prize but thats all we really know hes more important for the older generations
1333689 but recently in politics for russia its not clear what he has done
1333690 he became one of the main battering rams in destroying both the state and nation that is why he is being applauded so rapturously by both russian president medvedev and
1333691 with his life and work alexander solzhenitsyn greatly boosted societys immunity to all forms of tyranny

1333715 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1333716 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1333717 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1333718 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1333719 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1333720 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1333721 in m87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1333722 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1333723 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1333724 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center m87 sits at the center of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the center probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1333725 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time

1333750 this is the doomsday scenario that weve been dreading for the last 40 years

1333759 a lo largo de los a os hemos comunicado nuestra preocupaci n sobre la desaparici n de los primates sin embargo ahora tenemos datos s lidos que muestran que la situaci n es mucha m s critica de lo que nos hab amos imaginado
1333760 la destrucci n de los bosques tropicales ha sido siempre la primera causa pero ahora parece que la caza es una amenaza tan seria en algunas reas incluso cuando el h bitat est intacto en muchos lugares los primates est n literalmente siendo devorados por la extinci n
1333761 dijo jean christophe vi sub director del programa de especies de iucn
1333762 tener un grupo de animales bajo tan alta amenaza es francamente no comparable a cualquier otro grupo de especies documentado hasta la fecha
1333763 dentro de las especies africanas los grandes primates como los gorilas y bonobos siempre han generado mucha atenci n y a pesar de que est n altamente amenazados son los primates peque os como el colobo rojo los que pueden morir primero
1333764 aunque como hip tesis se admitiese que gerald y kate mccann pudiesen ser los responsables por la muerte de la ni a faltar a por explicar c mo por d nde cu ndo con qu medios con la ayuda de qui n y en d nde se deshicieron del cuerpo en tan corto espacio de tiempo del que para eso habr an dispuesto

1333770 los investigadores tienen plena conciencia de que su trabajo no est exento de imperfecciones trabajaron con un enorme margen de error y lo que alcanzaron es bien poco en t rminos de resultados concluyentes en especial sobre la suerte de la infeliz ni a

1333779 imaging of myocardial infarct size is difficult in the emergency setting as the current gold standard methods of delayed enhanced mri and nuclear medicine techniques are difficult to perform in unstable patients ct is very easy and quick to perform even at the acute phase so we wanted to find out if it can do the same job as mri and potentially provide further information

1333797 in any situation like the ones i experienced perhaps any of us could do those kind of cruel things for me it was like understanding what i couldnt understand before how for example the nazis how things like that could have happened

1333897 one of the objectives of our group is to provide a concise and clear direction for how the petroleum market can use radio frequency identification technology
1333898 this entails defining best practices operational processes data models and application architectures building this foundation provides a clear view of how rfid can be used to enhance operational issues in the petroleum industry
1333899 avery dennison rfid is excited to be a part of the oil amp gas rfid solution group
1333900 our goal at avery dennison is to continue to be a part of innovative rfid solutions avery dennison is lending its expertise to the petroleum industry by supplying tags and testing support for a variety of applications that could better streamline daily operational duties
1333901 this rfid guideline is an important step in developing a comprehensive look at rfid tag quality
1333902 the reg members involved in this work are to be commended for developing guidelines and test procedures that can be used industry wide
1333903 tag quality is important for all industries and applications the use of rfid with tires presents extreme challenges for both design and manufacturing quality including rfid into tire manufacturing requires surviving conditions of high heat and pressure in everyday use tires flex constantly and are subjected to extremes of heat and cold whats more tires contain carbon which can affect rf signals significantly
1333904 these guidelines will help the tire industry evaluate or develop rfid tags particularly those operating in the uhf range that can perform reliably under a wide range of conditions
1333905 the use of rfid for tires will help address the increasing demand to be able to identify and track tires for various applications even for the life of the tire additionally the ability to identify individual tires on large commercial vehicles helps operators maintain these tires and provides additional safety for equipment operators and the general public
1333906 hawaiis recent and extensive produce traceability pilot project provides invaluable insights into the viability of rfid technology to dramatically improve food supply chain safety
1333907 in addition to unveiling implementation details we will also discuss how rfid helps to protect the welfare of consumers through food safety and quality
1333908 rfid based solutions are key to addressing the growing number of global food safety issues and recalls
1333909 rfid worlds food traceability workshop will offer practical information presented by experienced rfid technology adopters that can be used immediately to improve the safety and reliability of the worlds food supply chain

1333920 the major issue now facing syria is its relationship with iran and hizbullah and how it can reconcile that with talking to israel

1333935 its going to be difficult to get anything in the near term
1333936 there is essentially zero integration it takes less than a minute to be up and running and have the ability to read and identify rfid tags
1333937 one of the challenges companies have faced when trying to integrate rfid into their businesses is that the early solutions added another layer of cost and complexity
1333938 that is no longer the case the rfid interpreter is another example of our efforts to simplify the implementation process and help companies lower the technical barriers of rfid adoption the ability to connect this device easily and seamlessly with existing legacy applications will give companies true plug and play rfid capabilities

1333942 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
1333943 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
1333944 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
1333945 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
1333946 as adults early maturing girls demonstrate lower academic and occupational achievement and report lower relationship quality and life satisfaction
1333947 it is thus important to identify protective factors that may mitigate negative effects of early maturation on girls adjustment
1333948 also early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
1333949 parental nurturance may decrease girls susceptibility to negative peer influence
1333950 also parental nurturance may help girls cope with challenges associated with early puberty by listening to their daughters difficulties and providing support and encouragement nurturing parents can help them develop better coping skills and diffuse negative emotions that might otherwise manifest as aggression
1333951 by discussing difficult peer situations e g provocation peer pressure and ways of dealing with them parents may help their daughters develop a repertoire of adaptive responses that will minimize the need for inappropriate i e aggressive behavior
1333952 in addition knowing how their daughters spend free time may help parents identify and prevent negative peer and other influences
1333953 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1333954 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1333955 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1333956 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms

1333969 the women in photojournalism conference has evolved into a gathering of women and men to explore photojournalism as a career or to expand our experiences and skills as visual storytellers
1333970 this not to be missed lineup shows off the best in visual journalism today and gives an inkling to the possibilities we can all take advantage of in the future

1333972 its something more than advertisers i never had any advertisers on my site but when checking my google results in advance of sending out some resumes recently i noticed that my poker blog is no longer listed as the first result as it has been for the past 2 years

1333981 when you go to most chain restaurants ordering off the kids menu is a nightmare
1333982 right now kids meals are almost all unhealthy meals when they should be almost all healthy meals

1333986 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1333987 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1333988 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1333989 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease

1334007 if youre home raising a family were not going to deny you the trust payments
1334008 you want beneficiaries to have a voice but not a controlling voice because they will inevitably want to increase the amount of money paid out of the trust to them
1334009 leave enough flexibility so youre not ruling from the grave
1334010 err on the side of giving the money to them anyway
1334011 i tell them to think about what values they want their kids and grandkids to have typically work ethic and responsible management of money

1334084 los asesinos de eta al igual que el asesino de franco tambi n son historia de espa a debemos eliminar entonces su recuerdo o no ahora es cuando daniel nos explica la diferencia
1334085 como casi todos he tenido durante muchos a os un pensamiento orientado hacia la izquierda enfermedad de la que creo estar totalmente curado como tantas veces ocurre la lectura me sac de la ignorancia b sicamente gracias a los libros de p o moa terrorista perteneciente al grapo y que testigos afirmaron que remat a martillazos en la cabeza a un agente de la polic a armada herido y a la lectura de correspondencia escrita por franco militar golpista que tras el golpe de estado del 36 impuso un r gimen dictatorial que dur 40 a os asesinando a cientos de miles de personas de su pu o y letra
1334086 mientras sig is llamando fascista a quienes no opinen como vosotros no avanzaremos nunca
1334087 tenemos que recorrer un per odo de transici n hacia el socialismo integral y ese per odo es la dictadura del proletariado templad el nimo para la batalla
1334088 estamos a las puertas de una acci n de tal naturaleza que conducir al proletariado a la revoluci n social
1334089 en qu se diferencia el partido socialista del partido comunista doctrinalmente en nada nosotros profesamos el marxismo en toda su pureza
1334090 el socialismo tendr que acudir a la m xima violencia para desplazar al capitalismo
1334091 llegar al socialismo dentro de la democracia burguesa eso es imposible
1334092 yo no s c mo hay quien tiene tanto horror a la dictadura del proletariado a una posible violencia obrera en ltimo extremo no es la democracia burguesa un sistema de opresi n y de violencia
1334093 cu les son las armas del capitalismo el ej rcito la guardia civil las guardias de asalto la polic a los tribunales de justicia y en su lugar qu esto el armamento general del pueblo

1334099 necesitamos el poder ntegro y eso es lo que pedimos la democracia no es para nosotos un fin sino un medio para ir a la conquista de un estado nuevo llegado el momento el parlamento o se somete o le hacemos desaparecer
1334100 lo segundo es que usted pierde toda legitimidad para dar lecciones de democracia al posicionarse del lado de aquellos que afirman que el golpe de estado contra el pueblo espa ol era inevitable
1334101 la democracia es solo el primer paso hacia la consecuci n de la dictadura del proletariado que nadie dude que el poder ser nuestro por las buenas o por las malas
1334102 este partido est en la legalidad mientras la legalidad le permita adquirir lo que necesita fuera de la legalidad cuando ella no le permita realizar sus aspiraciones

1334106 habr a dado un vuelco inmediato a la situaci n en el mediterr neo
1334107 si el 10 de enero hubi semos podido cruzar la frontera espa ola hoy estar a gibraltar en nuestras manos
1334108 se han perdido dos meses y en la guerra el tiempo es uno de los m s importantes factores
1334109 me permito indicar que la mayor parte del inmenso coste en sangre en esta lucha lo soporta hasta ahora alemania en primer lugar y luego italia y ambos a pesar de ello solamente han presentado modestas reivindicaciones
1334110 retrasar la entrada de espa a en guerra de paralizarla y con ello incrementar sus dificultades permanentemente y as poder finalmente derrocar al actual r gimen espa ol
1334111 en un arrebato sentimental nunca visto hasta ahora en su historia quisiera pensar de otro modo no le ser a posible ayudar realmente a espa a en una poca en que ella misma est obligada a rigurosas reducciones en su nivel de vida
1334112 en esta hist rica confrontaci n debemos atender a la suprema lecci n de que en tiempos tan dif ciles m s puede salvar a los pueblos un coraz n valeroso que una al parecer inteligente precauci n

1334115 con la autoridad que me da el haber sufrido durante casi tres a os el peso de una guerra para la liberaci n de mi patria me dirijo a las naciones en cuyas manos se encuentra el desencadenamiento de una cat strofe sin antecedentes en la historia para que eviten a los pueblos los dolores y tragedias
1334116 al buen sentido y responsabilidad de los gobernantes para encaminar todos los esfuerzos
1334117 har como bertoldo dec a el duce acept la condena a muerte con la condici n de escoger el rbol apropiado para ser ahorcado es in til decir que no encontr nunca ese rbol yo aceptar entrar en guerra reserv ndome la elecci n del momento oportuno
1334118 deseo ser yo solo el juez y mucho depender de la marcha de la guerra
1334119 con energ a y coherencia con numerosos cambios y alteraciones
1334120 cuando conoces a una persona con la que merece la pena hablar y no lo haces desaprovechas a la persona si conoces a una persona con la que no merece la pena hablar y hablas con ella desaprovechas tus propias palabras el hombre sabio no desaprovecha ni a las personas ni sus propias palabras
1334121 en este respecto dice que le interesan y preocupan tres puntos que son gibraltar marruecos e islas canarias
1334122 contin a diciendo el f hrer al pasar a tratar de gibraltar que sta es una cuesti n de honor para el pueblo espa ol el volver a reintegrar a la patria ese pedazo de suelo que est todav a en manos extranjeras y que por su posici n privilegiada en el estrecho sea el punto de apoyo m s importante que para la navegaci n en el mediterr neo tienen los aliados y que parece por tanto que hay que ir tomando en consideraci n la necesidad de que se cierre el estrecho ya que entre ceuta y gibraltar en manos espa olas ser a imposible la navegaci n
1334123 por lo que se refiere a las islas canarias dice que aunque est convencido de que los estados unidos no han de entrar en la guerra pues no tienen intereses de gran envergadura en ella no as los ingleses que aunque sufren una situaci n precaria actualmente en cualquier golpe de mano podr n hacerse con ellas y ser a desde luego un golpe muy fuerte contra la campa a submarina que con toda eficacia se est llevando a cabo
1334124 su excelencia el jefe del estado contesta a los puntos que acaba de mencionar el f hrer diciendo que aunque es exacto que gibraltar es un pedazo de tierra espa ola que hace muchos a os est en manos ajenas y que ser a gran satisfacci n para el pueblo espa ol que volviera a formar parte de la patria hay que comprender que lo que al f hrer le parece muy f cil que es tomar la ofensiva para gibraltar supone para un pueblo que acaba de pasar por una de las m s terribles guerras civiles un sacrificio excesivo ya que no tiene a n cerradas las heridas de todo orden que ha sufrido y que ser a muy peque a compensaci n para los estragos y dificultades que la entrada en guerra con inglaterra supondr
1334125 por otro lado contin a el caudillo por lo que se refiere a marruecos debe tenerse muy en cuenta el esfuerzo que para una espa a a n no rehecha de la guerra civil supone el mantenimiento de los efectivos militares que tiene en su zona y que obliga a las tropas francesas a mantener ellas mismas unos efectivos importantes inactivos que no pueden acudir a otros sectores
1334126 por lo que se refiere a las islas canarias no cree el caudillo que puedan ser objeto de un ataque pero desde luego reconoce que aun cuando existen en las islas los efectivos necesarios los medios de defensa de que disponen las islas no est n a la altura de las circunstancias pues el armamento no es eficiente
1334127 a esto contest el f hrer diciendo que se enviar an por alemania las bater as de costa de gran calibre que fueran necesarias as como los t cnicos encargados de montarlas y ense ar su manejo
1334128 se ala el caudillo con referencia al cierre del estrecho de gibraltar que considera de mucha m s urgencia e importancia el cierre del canal de suez pues el corte de ste traer a aparejada la inutilidad del estrecho de gibraltar y pasar a a ser un mar muerto el mediterr neo
1334129 el f hrer se mantiene en su postura de que considera m s importante cerrar por gibraltar que por suez
1334130 insiste el f hrer en se alar los grandes beneficios que reportar a a espa a una intervenci n al lado del eje manifestando que cree llegado el momento en que espa a tome una determinaci n pues no puede permanecer indiferente a la realidad de los hechos y de que las tropas alemanas se encuentran en los pirineos
1334131 contesta a esto el caudillo que no cree que tenga nada que ver la actitud de espa a en las conversaciones de una potencia que acaba de ser derrotada por alemania y a costa de la cual se le acaban de hacer ofrecimientos pues una de dos o estos ofrecimientos no son m s que el cebo para una posible entrada de espa a en la guerra o no se piensa llevar a cabo si la actitud de alemania con el gobierno de francia no es excesivamente dura
1334132 esta contestaci n del caudillo no parece agradar mucho al f hrer seguramente porque es verdad y recalca de una manera un poco vehemente y sin recoger lo dicho por el general simo que l no puede ir a montoire a entrevistarse con p tain sin conocer una actitud definitiva por parte de espa a
1334133 el caudillo vuelve a insistir en lo antes manifestado y adem s reitera que espa a que acaba de sufrir una grav sima guerra civil que ha tenido cerca de un mill n de muertos por todos conceptos que est falta de v veres y de armamento no puede ser llevada sin m s a una guerra cuyo alcance no se puede medir y en la cual no iba a sacar nada
1334134 en la segunda parte de la conferencia se nota desde el principio el af n del f hrer de hacer ver al caudillo la conveniencia de entrar al lado de alemania en la guerra por estar sta como quien dice virtualmente ganada y asegurando que tendr a espa a cuanta ayuda pudiera necesitar tanto en provisiones como en armamentos
1334135 vuelve el caudillo a insistir en lo que tantas veces ha repetido durante el curso de la conversaci n que espa a no est preparada para entrar en ninguna guerra y que no se le pueden pedir sacrificios in tiles para no obtener nada por ellos y que considera que ya es buena ayuda la neutralidad espa ola que le permite no tener efectivos en los pirineos y la distracci n de fuertes contingentes franceses por nuestras fuerzas militares en la zona de marruecos aparte de lo que representa el haberse adue ado espa a de t nger evitando que lo hicieran otros
1334136 el f hrer a esta contestaci n y visiblemente contrariado manifest que aunque eso sea verdad no es lo suficiente ni lo que necesita alemania
1334137 el caudillo le vuelve a contestar que l no puede llevar al pueblo espa ol a una guerra que desde luego ser a impopular ya que en ella no se podr a alegar que iba envuelto el prestigio ni la conveniencia de espa a
1334138 despu s de un forcejeo insistiendo ambos jefes de estado en sus puntos de vista y teniendo en cuenta que quiere llegarse a una soluci n por parte de alemania propone el f hrer de acuerdo con su ministro de asuntos exteriores ribbentrop que se firme por parte de espa a un compromiso en el que se comprometa a entrar en la guerra al lado de alemania cuando sta estime necesario que lo haga m s adelante
1334139 el caudillo vuelve a insistir en los repetidos puntos de vista respecto a la imposibilidad de espa a de entrar en una guerra que no le habr a de reportar ning n beneficio y que por tanto aunque fuera un compromiso aplazado l no lo puede aceptar
1334140 se siguen manteniendo durante m s de tres cuartos de hora los respectivos puntos de vista y pasadas las doce y media el f hrer que ha ido cada vez m s perdiendo su control se dirige en alem n a ribbentrop y le dice ya tengo bastante
1334141 el f hrer dando muestras de su soberbia o de su mala educaci n se levanta de la mesa y de forma completamente militar y agria se despide de los presentes acompa ado de su ministro de asuntos exteriores
1334142 la actitud del caudillo no ha podido ser m s viril ni m s patriota ni m s realista pues se ha mantenido firme ante las presiones justificadas o no del f hrer y ha pasado por alto con la mayor dignidad los malos modos al no ver satisfechos sus deseos del f hrer canciller luis alvarez de estrada bar n de las torres
1334143 hice todo lo posible para convencerle de que la guerra no estaba ganada ni mucho menos pues al continuarla inglaterra como lo estaba haciendo ello hac a suponer que esta naci n ten a la seguridad de que los estados unidos entrar an en la contienda
1334144 no le quepa la menor duda y por ello aunque crea en el triunfo de alemania espa a no est en condiciones de entrar en la contienda sin resolver antes muchos problemas el principal de ellos el abastecimiento del pueblo
1334145 deseaba hitler para mantener la paz una estrecha alianza con espa a antes que lo hiciera francia me ponder el brillante papel que la historia hab a reservado a nuestra patria en el nuevo orden que se iba a organizar en europa me negu diplom ticamente a ello dici ndole que lo que espa a necesitaba era su reconstrucci n pues hab a queda do muy quebrantada despu s de nuestra guerra le manifest adem s mi absoluta convicci n de que inglaterra no estaba vencida y de que seguir a la lucha en francia en la metr poli o en un sitio cualquiera de su gran imperio que no creyera que el pueblo franc s estaba a su lado pues ahora siente m s que nunca antipat a por las potencias del eje en aquellos dif ciles momentos como en todo el tiempo que dur el conflicto mundial no tuve otro af n que salvar la neutralidad de espa a estaba decidido a ello costase lo que costase y me hubiera defendido contra cualquier agresor fuese alemania o los aliados hubi semos repetido la gesta de espa a contra napole n creo que hitler se dio cuenta de mi manera de pensar y por ello nos respet lo mismo que inglaterra o norteam rica
1334146 franco dice se mostr con toda raz n indignado ante aquel documento que los alemanes tra an preparado con la pretensi n de empujarnos a la guerra sin darnos ninguna compensaci n es intolerable esta gente me dec a quieren que entremos en la guerra a cambio de nada no nos podemos fiar de ellos si no contraen en lo que firmemos el compromiso formal terminante de defendernos desde ahora los territorios que como les he explicado son nuestro derecho de otra manera ahora no entraremos en la guerra este nuevo sacrificio nuestro dec a franco s lo tendr a la justificaci n con la contrapartida de lo que ha de ser la base de nuestro imperio despu s de la victoria contra lo que dicen si ahora no se comprometen formalmente no nos dar an nada
1334147 las demandas de espa a para entrar en la guerra son demasiado altas nueve horas duraron las conversaciones y hitler antes de sufrir la experiencia otra vez preferir a que le sacasen tres o cuatro muelas
1334148 tan engreidos y vanidosos se inclinaban a realizar cosas de que eran incapaces ped an sin cesar exorbitantes concesiones a alemania pero no se compromet an jam s a nada se hab an reservado enteramente la importante cuesti n de decidir la fecha de su entrada en guerra
1334149 en el documento fechado pero sin firma ni antefirma se consignaban las peticiones de espa a con m nimas condiciones previas muy generales para una eventual intervenci n en el conflicto suministros de material b lico era el nico punto relativamente detallado ayuda econ mica y garant a de abastecimientos de art culos b sicos entre ellos combustibles adem s se reivindicaba gibraltar y se formulaban reclamaciones territoriales en el norte de africa no era un proyecto de tratado ni tampoco incluia compromisos parec a un resumen de lo expuesto por franco a los alemanes el memorando apenas ten a puntos de contacto con un borrador alem n del convenio de hendaya supuesta adhesi n de espa a al pacto tripartito de 27 de septiembre de 1940 publicado sin firma alguna por los norteamericanos en 1960 e inexistente en el registro de tratados del ministerio de asuntos exteriores supe despu s que el documento fue muy mal acogido por los alemanes y que se trabaj en otro
1334150 de otra manera transmit a el embajador puede ocurrir cualquier cosa
1334151 nuestras enmiendas dice serrano su er desvirtuaban el grave texto propuesto por los alemanes en hendaya
1334152 cuando la situaci n general lo exigiese la de espa a lo permitiera y se diera cumplimiento a las exigencias puestas por nosotros para dar aquel paso
1334153 en ella franco dice que ante la insistencia de hitler en llegar a un acuerdo con p tain
1334154 y a la parte de marruecos que est en manos de francia y que enlaza nuestra zona del norte con las posesiones espa olas ifni y sahara
1334155 bufando de rabia y se pas todo el trayecto echando pestes del jesuita serrano su er y el cobarde desagradecido de franco que nos lo debe todo y ahora no quiere cooperar
1334156 quiz hayan existido en espa a algunas personas que hubieran visto con gusto la participaci n activa de espa a en la guerra pero seg n mi opini n personal ni el jefe del estado franco ni sus colaboradores inmediatos ni especialmente serrano su er tuvieron nunca la intenci n de meter a espa a en guerra al lado de los pa ses del eje ten an motivos muy fundados para esta posici n que usted cita no eran en absoluto pretextos sino hechos reales tambi n creo que franco muy bien informado sobre la situaci n general y militar de alemania nunca consider con mucho optimismo las perspectivas de una victoria final de alemania
1334157 el primer resultado del arbitrario gesto de mussolini seg n hitler me dijo fue que franco decidiese evitar la colaboraci n con las potencias del eje ya que no deseaba comprometerse con personas que actuaban tan imprevisiblemente
1334158 si quieres visitar italia al state en el ej rcito griego
1334159 englobar toda la pen nsula en el teatro de operaciones de los pa ses del eje y expulsar a la flota inglesa del mediterr neo occidental
1334160 parece claro que por una raz n de imposibilidad material espa a no intervenga en la guerra en tanto que el canal de suez est en poder de los ingleses
1334161 espa a no pod a ni deb a tomar parte en la guerra
1334162 el pueblo espa ol se opondr a a cualquier invasi n
1334163 los caballeros espa oles tendr n que creer en mi palabra y no insistir en una declaraci n escrita precisa
1334164 carrero me insiste en que recuerde bien la fecha noviembre 1940 da los nombres de los jefes de operaciones y cita tambi n como asistentes a los jefes de secci n del alto estado mayor serrano su er me dec a regresaba de berl n sic con el virtual compromiso de entrar en guerra pro eje hacia navidad d vila pregunt por la preparaci n de espa a cuesta le dice que ante todo habr a que invadir portugal lacalle dice que aviones y bombas son insuficientes lo que queda de nuestra guerra carrero pregunta al jefe de intendencia del alto estado mayor cu nto tiempo resistir a espa a sin la l nea del trigo plata y la l nea del petr leo usa caribe es decir no plantea el problema en plan t ctico o log stico sino de corte estrat gico total por otra parte moreno el ministro hab a entregado a franco un informe de carrero en este sentido
1334165 el ministro de exteriores acaba de decirme que el general simo est de acuerdo en comenzar los preparativos propuestos pero no pod a determinar la fecha exacta de la declaraci n de guerra
1334166 ahora dudo de que fuera canaris la persona adecuada para esta misi n pero parece haber disimulado muy bien durante a os supongo que no se esforz en serio para convencer a espa a sino que previno en contra nuestra a sus amigos de ese pa s
1334167 habido el telegrama del almirante canaris 10 de diciembre el fuhrer decide que no se realice la operaci n f lix pues ya no existen los requisitos pol ticos necesarios
1334168 hitler anunci que abandonaba la idea no le gustaba verse obligado a transportar sus tropas a la fuerza contra la c lera de franco
1334169 la actitud de espa a se ha vuelto vacilante pero aunque parezca muy dif cil conseguirlo intentaremos otra vez que entre en la guerra

1334173 sin ayuda de hitler y mussolini hoy no habr a ni espa a nacional ni caudillo
1334174 el f hrer y el gobierno alem n est n profundamente disgustados por la equivoca y vacilante actitud de espa a
1334175 el gobierno alem n act a de esta manera a fin de evitar que espa a emprenda a ltima hora un camino que seg n su firme convicci n s lo puede terminar en cat strofe pues a menos que el caudillo decida inmediatamente unirse a la guerra de las potencias del eje el gobierno alem n no puede sino prever el fin de la espa a nacional
1334176 independientemente de los favores pasados y de la gratitud por ellos todo esp ritu honrado se permite una sola cosa seguir el camino que m s interesa a la naci n
1334177 el reich pide una vez m s al general franco una respuesta clara

1334318 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1334319 ron suskind has chosen to dwell in the netherworld of bizarre conspiracy theories the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1334320 as every report and commission on pre war intelligence has concluded the saddam hussein wanted his neighbors to believe he had weapons of mass destruction
1334321 our intelligence estimates at the time and intelligence estimates from other nations believed that he still harbored such weapons we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1334322 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1334573 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1334574 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1334575 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1334576 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1334577 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1334578 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1334579 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires

1334587 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1334588 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined
1334589 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1334590 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

1334594 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1334595 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1334596 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1334597 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1334598 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1334599 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1334600 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1334601 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1334602 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1334603 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1334611 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1334612 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1334613 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1334614 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1334615 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1334616 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1334617 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1334618 it was sen obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1334619 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another barack obama a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a 1 000 rebate a president wholl stand up for you
1334620 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1334621 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again

1334629 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1334630 my first job in all honesty is going to continue to be mom in chief
1334631 making sure that in this transition which will be even more of a transition for the girls that they are settled and that they know they will continue to be the center of our universe
1334632 tack on the fact that there is no sustained mental health support for these families as they are struggling with loved ones who are coming back dealing with emotional issues
1334633 youve got people in pain and we dont hear those voices a lot
1334634 i found it wasnt that barack wasnt interested in helping
1334635 its just that when the baby cried at 4 a m i got up faster than he did because i would hear the baby and i would be up
1334636 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1334637 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1334638 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1334639 interferes with the issue which is who should be elected in november
1334640 now i will be glad as soon as this election is over in january to have this conversation with you and everybody else i have very strong feelings about it

1334650 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1334651 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1334652 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1334653 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1334654 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1334655 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1334656 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there

1334938 i had told my manager i wanted the summer off because i had fought 14 times in the last 20 months and the average fighter only competes 3 or 4 times a year he then called on sunday the 27th and asked if i would be interested in fighting in the ufc and i could not believe my dream had come true it still feels like a dream that i just cant seem to wrap my head around i dont think i will be able to until i get in the octagon and get tagged a few times ben is good at striking and ju jitsu and my ju jitsu and muay thai are good but wrestling is my strongest skill and i feel his weakest saunders i think is a good match up for me he has the height advantage and has had months to prepare to my 12 days but im stronger and my wrestling gives me a strategic advantage the great thing about wrestling is that i can out there and try and take him down and knock him out if i feel he is getting the better of me striking or if i get hurt i feel i can easily take him down to protect myself if the situation is reversed the ability to take him down becomes a strategy for me which limits him to striking as a way to defend himself in a lot of ways its like a chess match
1334939 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1334940 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1334941 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1334942 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1334943 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1334944 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1334945 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimise the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1334946 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1334947 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike
1334948 so yeah i take it personally but its not the first time and it probably wont be the last time

1334955 i appreciate being back on dry land with some of the creature comforts of life after a day or so on your own it can become quite monotonous

1334959 in themselves limits on offshore drilling are only a modest sized issue
1334960 its true that scientists dont know exactly how much world temperatures will rise if we persist with business as usual but that uncertainty is actually what makes action so urgent while theres a chance that well act against global warming only to find that the danger was overstated theres also a chance that well fail to act only to find that the results of inaction were catastrophic which risk would you rather run
1334961 there are a dizzying number of economic and national security arguments for drilling at home a 700 billion oil balance of payments deficit a gas tax equivalent levied on the paychecks of american workers and poured into the treasuries of enemy and terror supporting regimes growing dependence on unstable states of the persian gulf and caspian basin
1334962 they seem blissfully unaware that the argument for their drill there not here policy collapses on its own environmental terms
1334963 polestar und volvo haben vor in die wtcc einzusteigen aber es gibt noch keinen konkreten zeitplan daf r
1334964 nat rlich wenn wir gute ergebnisse holen wenn in anderen m rkten das interesse besteht und wenn wir eine gute finanzielle l sung finden dann k nnte es realit t werden aber jetzt ist das alles f r uns noch sehr weit weg derzeit konzentrieren wir uns einzig und allein darauf die saison in der stcc bestm glich abzuschlie en
1334965 jetzt ist das alles f r uns noch sehr weit weg

1334967 ich glaube das waren sie nicht massa hatte ein gutes rennen aber kimi r ikk nen anm d red war nicht sonderlich stark der ausgang der ersten kurve war dass die leute massa in f hrung sahen und lewis auf platz zwei
1334968 wir wechselten in den benzinstrategiemodus um sicherzustellen dass wir beim zweiten stopp nach massa hereinkommen wir planten einen langen zweiten stint und wollten massa beim letzten stopp berholen ich denke dass lewis die pace dazu hatte
1334969 especie de academia de operaci n triunfo de nacionalistas fracasados
1334970 totalmente la realidad la historia y el esfuerzo de todos los extreme os para lograr la calidad de vida que tenemos

1334972 hay un muerto es el se or hern n montero no tenemos su edad es joven y adem s hay 11 heridos algunos de bala
1334973 ahora quiero pasar pagina hay gente nueva y lo nico que quiero es tranquilidad y dar lo mejor para que se hable de m s lo por lo deportivo
1334974 hay gente nueva que apuesta porque contin e y creo que en la decisi n que se tome al final vamos a ir de la mano y esperemos que sea buena para las dos partes todo parece tener otro aire mas positivo
1334975 a d a de hoy soy jugador del valencia y si salgo ser a por una cosa que me gustara mucho o por aventura en el extranjero pero ahora mi postura es la de entrenar tranquilo y al margen de lo que va mas all de lo deportivo
1334976 habr gente que no entienda mi manera de defenderme por una decisi n que yo no tom pero a n no se ha dicho el motivo de aquello si no hubi ramos estado peleando por el descenso quiz s ahora los tres ser amos considerados el c ncer del valencia pero afortunadamente la gente que tom esas decisiones ya no est en el club
1334977 la nica manera de contrarrestar la opini n de la gente que no crea en m o piense que yo no debo estar es rindiendo a un buen nivel deportivo eso es lo nico que hace olvidar todo a la gente y ese es el camino que debo seguir
1334978 para jugar en el valencia no me hace falta llevar el brazalete porque no me hace rendir mejor
1334979 la tranquilidad que busco pasa por no llevar la capitan a y no asumir cosas que antes asum a para centrarme en lo deportivo y nada m s

1334981 will then purchase the remaining interest from bertelsmann for approximately 600 million as a result bertelsmann will receive approximately 900 million in value for its 50 percent stake plus 300 million of its share of cash on sony bmgs balance sheet
1334982 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1334983 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1334984 music has been a vital and vibrant part of sonys culture for over 20 years this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates
1334985 the many new distribution paths are causing an increase in the demand for music use rights
1334986 in view of this fact we believe that building a business for the management and exploitation of such rights in europe is an attractive proposition we want to take advantage of our opportunities and position ourselves with the strong well established bmg brand and a management that is highly regarded in the market

1334999 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
1335000 but after the pressure we applied libya will finally be held accountable for these devastating events our bill becoming law means these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
1335001 it is a relief to say that this part of our fight is coming to an end theres still more work to be done and the families arent done fighting for the truth
1335002 there are still a lot of things that we want to know
1335003 for the longer term we continue to be confident in our financial strength and positioning
1335004 new sales have been largely on track with expectations and we have been making significant progress on the integration of the businesses we have acquired in the near term however we expect conditions to remain challenging

1335029 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people
1335030 what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore

1335051 morgan olsen possesses the wide range of financial expertise and experience and the management skills necessary to help continue asus ascent among the nations leading public research universities
1335052 we are fortunate to have recruited someone of his quality who is not only respected for his solid business sense but also known for his initiative and creativity
1335053 i am grateful to morgan olsen for his strong fiscal management of purdues business operations and for helping purdue to grow its financial resources substantially dr olsen has provided oversight for an unprecedented growth in capital projects at purdue he has led the development of a large electronic business initiative that is called onepurdue it is an integrative approach that catapults purdue forward in adopting best business practices for human resources and student services morgan has also led in the development of new campus master plans for the west lafayette and regional campuses these plans reflect the universitys strategic priorities for campus design and sustainability all of purdue congratulates him on his unique opportunity at arizona state and we wish him much success in this new venture

1335059 councillors could meet in bernie grant centre or theres a dilapidated council chamber still at hornsey town hall or any one of a number of meeting places in the borough it would be great anyway and symbolic if the councillors came out of a building and held their full council meeting in various parts of the borough
1335060 its easy to dismiss it as mere tokenism but then a surprising amount of tokenism ends up in the mainstream its undoubtedly true that much of what passes these days for the establishment is london obsessed
1335061 when it comes to collaboration technologies it needs to take off the brakes and put its foot on the gas
1335062 collaborative technologies such as web 2 0 will happen and if the cio tries to impose a terribly prescriptive strategy he or she will be out of a job
1335063 you have to partner with the business and be able to demonstrate that you can accomplish collaboration better than anyone else and come up with new ideas for technology which are useful
1335064 collaboration is either in your blood or not and it is in mine
1335065 we are using collaboration technologies for effective engagement with our client base recruitment base and internally to talk to each other without having to worry about the distances between us innovation is encouraged within the is amp t department and people are trying out new toys which can be turned into something useful for the business
1335066 many employees would not bother reading helpdesk emails informing them that the server will be down for a time but then they phone up the helpdesk to complain about the downtime we look for ways to be more effective in getting information across and stopping the rubbish coming through
1335067 our rss feeds allow anyone to subscribe to our job advertising and last month 10 per cent of the job applications to our uk web site came directly from our uk rss job feed
1335068 it is a very cheap high availability method of getting information to people who want to receive it they have to subscribe so it means we are not spamming we use feedburner to manage rss feeds but there are many different products available and it is simple to do
1335069 blogs are our window to the world and a method of getting our message across
1335070 they have ensured that harvey nash is not a passive business by steering the company towards becoming thought leaders and almost a news channel
1335071 we measure all traffic that comes through the web site to demonstrate in pounds the value to the business executives can then see where something is working and we can suggest improvements such as using key words in blogs to improve search engine positioning
1335072 if you are starting out you could consider a hosted service and localised technology
1335073 we focused on brand recognition across our groups because we are global but we are not prescriptive about content
1335074 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1335075 we are spending all of this time on a parliamentary tactic when nothing less is at stake than the planet the air we breathe our children breathe
1335076 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1335077 scientists are people too and its time we started treating them that way
1335078 whats been reported to us is a fairly obnoxious odour that has been bothering the people that live in that area since about friday morning
1335079 when they went down to look at what was causing the odour they noticed a fairly extensive area of white cloudy water which is of course an indication of an anoxic event happening
1335080 any sufficiently advanced technology can be mistaken for magic god
1335081 why are you people so hate filled why screw all of you and the horse you rode in on i hate intolerant people
1335082 scientists are people too and its time we started treating them that way
1335083 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1335084 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
1335085 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection
1335086 the rank and file in her party increasingly are just trying to save their political hides
1335087 now that obama has morphed to become more like mccain my biggest worry is that barack obama will ignore the suffering of the middle class
1335088 we like mr obamarama and we hope he will win the election
1335089 its up to you mr president if you think we need to go in its your call and we support you however if things start to go badly we democrats will abandon you and blame you for our own political gain
1335090 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1335091 not aware of any troop concentrations by georgia in or near south ossetia
1335092 if events develop according to the worst case violence scenario russia will not allow itself to remain indifferent considering that russian citizens live in south ossetia particularly in the conflict zone
1335093 delivered weapons ammunition or other supplies to al qaeda members and associates
1335094 a plethora of facts that shows you how he committed overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy
1335095 hamdan was al qaeda every fact in this case points to that
1335096 mr hamdan is not an al qaeda warrior he is not last line of defense
1335097 you should not punish the generals driver today with the crimes of the general
1335098 the general is a war criminal and therefore the driver also is it didnt work that way in world war ii hitlers driver was never charged with a war crime and it doesnt work that way today
1335099 solzhenitsyn was one of the most important people in the history of russia he wrote exactly what he thought and needed to be remembered
1335100 the iocs priority is to ensure that as many people as possible get to experience the magic of the olympic games and the inspirational sporting achievements of the olympic athletes
1335101 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel which will make fantastic olympic footage available where young generations of sports fans are already going for online entertainment
1335102 non criminal fugitive aliens an alternative to having us basically track them down arrest and remove them on the governments terms
1335103 this will allow them a little bit of control over the removal process that ultimately will come for each and every one of them
1335104 a pin or shaft on or with which a wheel or pair of wheels revolves
1335105 i came to pray for the country to come together and with president bush coming for his visit to go smoothly
1335106 will it completely stop them from coming across of course not
1335107 rest assured there will eventually be holes in parts of the wall made by people trying to get in but it buys us valuable time
1335108 the great wall of china did not stop the mongols and the berlin wall didnt stop people escaping to freedom why do they think this will be any different
1335109 is a political initiative meant to satisfy conservatives in congress who have played to fears about all immigrants being terrorists criminals and living off the dole
1335110 we have no idea to what extent we can enforce our own laws
1335111 the consequences of an open border are smuggling of drugs and human beings into this country
1335112 intensified and mixed anti immigrant racist views with a law enforcement only approach towards immigration
1335113 the main immigration flow has not stopped coming it just shifted
1335114 in other words the same number or more people are crossing the border
1335115 the wall is symptomatic of the fact that the us is not responsive to a rational immigration policy

1335240 youll never play for england because youre too small and not strong enough
1335241 there is this madness around me around my family without a doubt out on the field is where im most comfortable where im happiest because i know what im doing and i know i can do it
1335242 people always ask me do you play golf because a majority of sportsmen do i used to play quite a few years ago but to be honest id rather spend 4 hours with the kids than 4 hours on a golf course as much as it can be relaxing its a frustrating sport my way of relaxing is listening to music and spending time with the kids
1335243 i never do anything where i dont believe in what im doing i see that something could happen in u s soccer that change isnt going to happen in a year or two its more of a 5 10 or even 15 year plan i believe in it and i believe that in years to come this could be one of the biggest sports here in america
1335244 im a really bad loser it stays with me for a while i always take it quite personally when we dont win as a team or i dont win in everything else i do
1335245 i dont worry about any other players ive always concentrated on what my job is more than anything more than how good the other team is no matter who the opponent is even off the field if you do your job then theres nothing else
1335246 preseason if where you get the stability for the rest of the season ill never perform at my highest level unless im 100 percent fit thats one of my biggest attributes the energy ive got on the field for me training is as important as the games
1335247 my games all about moving around the pitch i went through a stage a few years ago where i lifted a lot of weights and put on about a stone about 14 pounds and ended up not being able to run
1335248 to be someone kids look up to is a great honor what matters is how you carry yourself off and on the field
1335249 people always say to me why would you place yourself in a position where you have to put pressure on yourself but its what gives me energy i know what im doing
1335250 even if i had a great game hes always say you played well but these were the mistakes you made if i had a bad game id hear all about that when i was playing for manchester united playing something like 200 games and winning european cup finals he still wouldnt let me get away with saying ive made it so thats one thing i have never done and never will do
1335251 youll never play for england because youre too small and not strong enough
1335252 because the american people arent getting a vacation from 4 gallon gasoline congress shouldnt be taking a 5 week paid vacation
1335253 congress should be working in a bipartisan manner to give the american people more access to american oil
1335254 wedded to a san francisco extremist ideology that prevents her from understanding the pain being felt by real people
1335255 when brazil discovered huge new offshore oil reserves it caused a national celebration it was a matter of pride when we discover oil here in nancy pelosis congress its treated as a matter of shame
1335256 shouldnt congress cancel their vacation plans when families are canceling theirs because of high gas prices
1335257 in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit
1335258 someone suggested we could drive 20 minutes to continue under the ministry of our former priest i answered yes we love him but we love worship and give our lives to our eucharistic lord in the context of the local body he has called us to be a part of i e we follow jesus not any man
1335259 a loose knit network of entertainers who share common beliefs like supporting u s troops and traditional american values
1335260 functioned like a support group organizing informal gatherings where actors producers screenwriters key grips and other industry types can share common values or discuss concerns like anti americanism in hollywood movies or the perception of industry bias
1335261 this adds to our support of sql mysql oracle excel and sql analysis services
1335262 our vision is to bring business intelligence everywhere to everyone the way to do so is to allow anyone to directly query the data so no additional it effort is required to prepare the data for analysis

1335266 these suicides were desperate acts committed by prisoners who saw neither an end to nor a reason for their incarceration
1335267 who gives us the right to take the freedom of people and separate them from their families without charging them with crimes how would we feel if an american is subjected to such immoral and illegal practice mr al haj must be freed and compensated for all the harm we have caused to him and his family mr al haj deserves an apology
1335268 when we hear someone refer to the great mujahid someone who struggles in allahs cause osama bin laden as a terrorist we should defend our brother and refer to him as a freedom fighter someone who has forsaken wealth and power to fight in allahs cause and speak out against oppressors we take these stances only to please allah
1335269 all public records concerning or relating to any arrest and or booking of edwin ramos
1335270 largely as a result of san franciscos self imposed sanctuary status
1335271 thought the strides the government is making towards religious freedom is noteworthy
1335272 since the cpc designation was removed there has been further progress the government held over 3 000 training courses and 10 000 workshops for officials throughout the country on how to implement the new law on religion
1335273 the vietnamese communist partys 2007 8 religion campaign plan to train 21 811 communist religious workers in the political management of religion with a special focus on ethnic minorities
1335274 is to force the state legislators to start cutting the bloated state budget
1335275 the idea here is to stop being on the defensive in fighting against big government and to start taking the political offensive
1335276 the dialogue is not proceeding well because of the two facedness of most muslim interlocutors on the one hand and the gullibility of well meaning western idealists on the other
1335277 first both sides should acknowledge candidly that although they might use identical terms these mean different things to each of them the word peace for example implies to a muslim the extension of the dar al islam or house of islam to the entire world
1335278 this is completely different from the enlightenment concept of eternal peace that dominates western thought a concept developed by immanuel kant
1335279 similarly when muslims and the western heirs of the enlightenment speak of tolerance they have different things in mind in islamic terminology this term implies abiding non islamic monotheists such as christians jews and zoroastrians as second class believers they are dhimmi a protected but politically immature minority
1335280 revise their understanding of peace and tolerance by accepting pluralism
1335281 i have found that many though not all were ready to welcome visitors from america and also to come here to explore with christians and jews what we have in common
1335282 the bishop was irritated because he perceived this behavior as a gross discourtesy
1335283 but the imam had only acted according to his faith for if an imam gives a bishop a koran he considers this a dawa or call to islam
1335284 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1335285 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1335286 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1335287 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1335288 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1335289 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign
1335290 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man
1335291 i am not familiar with the particulars of the case so i am commenting in general the fec will have to examine all the circumstances before determining any wrongdoing
1335292 we havent see a lot of indication that theres going to be much out there for back to school

1335302 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1335303 the fed is really locked in right now they cant go forward or backward
1335304 we cannot and will not allow a wage price spiral to develop
1335305 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1335306 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1335307 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1335308 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1335309 although market conditions in the homebuilding industry remain challenging we continue to focus on reducing our inventory and generating cash flow from operations
1335310 the residents are so angry and have said they will put poison around the plantation areas to kill the elephants unless officials take quick action
1335311 im afraid that another attack on their plantations will push villagers to launch their plan
1335312 people here eagerly planted palmoil as it brings more profits but its all been easily destroyed by elephants
1335313 oh my god this is a total piece of crap how did this even get published
1335314 these days he stays away from junk food and instead snacks on met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and drinks black forest berry honest tea a healthy organic brew
1335315 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea and worry about the price of arugula
1335316 the dalai obama v karma pedal your tricycle back to the faculty lounge
1335317 horrified by the prospect of a law professor running the country
1335318 brave and rebellious while working tenured jobs with outstanding benefits and while toeing the administration line with a scrupulousness worthy of ocd
1335319 obama was a lawprof the way bill and hillary clinton were lawprofs
1335320 i am going to lead our nation to energy independence and im going to do it with a realistic and comprehensive all of the above approach that uses every resource available to finally solve this crisis
1335321 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1335322 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1335323 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1335324 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1335325 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1335326 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1335327 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1335328 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1335329 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1335330 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1335331 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1335332 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1335333 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1335334 hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery
1335335 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country

1335337 he has got a big brain and a good heart he just needs to apply them both to working through these issues as best he can and trust the politics
1335338 we moved forward to try to get control of the property and that way we can control what goes there in the future and then at the same time we rid ourselves of a problem thats been there for seven years
1335339 everyone we talked to about it was really really supportive
1335340 we had called a council meeting to purchase this and we got a standing ovation when it was released to them that this was our intention
1335341 our churches have been very supportive in all of our efforts and theyve even gone behind the scenes to try to do what they could do to rid the community of this problem
1335342 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1335343 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1335344 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten into extinction
1335345 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1335346 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this
1335347 i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1335348 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1335349 i would not carry a mask i do not see a need for that this is not a measure i would recommend unless you have a particular disorder
1335350 i would not say that those people should not carry protection devices if they so feel but i honestly doubt about the efficiency unless they are carrying a new generation of masks i dont know
1335351 the misty air is not a feature of pollution but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1335352 make all you can save all you can give all you can

1335377 we are pleased that john is taking the helm at marinus particularly at such a crucial stage of development of the companys lead compound ganaxolone a new class of epilepsy treatment
1335378 marinus has developed an innovative formulation of ganaxolone which we believe sets a foundation for positive clinical outcomes and makes marinus an exciting investment opportunity
1335379 i am thrilled to join the marinus team and to shepherd the companys promising compounds through clinical development and closer to commercialization
1335380 i have committed my career to the development of novel therapies that address unmet patient needs and im excited about the innovative candidates in the marinus pipeline
1335381 following a thorough strategic review of our portfolio and business we will focus resources on our most advanced product candidates with the primary emphasis on our phase iii program with pimavanserin and streamline our operations
1335382 we regret that this restructuring will result in a substantial reduction in our workforce involving many dedicated and loyal employees however through these actions we believe we have positioned acadia to achieve key milestones in our advanced clinical programs while at the same time extending our cash runway into the first half of 2010 we also have added further strength and flexibility through a new committed equity financing facility with kingsbridge announced separately today

1335392 we are particularly excited about the chance to apply our biomarker expertise to these compounds at the clinical development and pre clinical development stage
1335393 adenosines scientific team has made promising discoveries relating to genetic variants in adenosine receptors and disease states such as diabetes we believe that pursuing biomarker strategies from the early stages of clinical trials will enable us to realize a more efficient development pathway resulting in drugs targeted to the segment of the patient population most likely to respond
1335394 this deal was made on very favorable terms and is precisely the sort of opportunity we have been seeking to leverage our pharmacogenomic expertise against a promising set of clinical and preclinical drug candidates in addition our cardiology sales force may be expanded to handle the launch of stedivaze once marketing approval of that drug is obtained

1335580 acho que foi uma prepara o bem planeada fizemos tudo ao nosso alcance para nos prepararmos o melhor poss vel agora claro o canal da mancha o maior desafio de todos
1335581 parte competitiva deixou de ser um aliciante e a parte de aventura come ou a despertar mais interesse
1335582 n s estamos habituados no dia a dia a fazer o que f cil e s vemos o que f cil no fundo a ideia ir buscar alguma coisa que custe e que nos leve ao sofrimento para conhecermos os nossos limites
1335583 t nhamos umas condi es de mar muito m s a gua a certa altura desceu a 13 graus que mais fria que no canal da mancha ao fim de 7 horas custou bastante

1335714 im not opposed to alternative energy or looking at options
1335715 but if repercussions exist its our job to protect this citys residents
1335716 we have to consider covenants and restrictions historic districts and different architectural factors
1335717 we have different zoning codes that need to be figured out were dealing with the human factor here
1335718 we didnt believe the proposal should pass as it originally stood
1335719 you cant just ignore the visual or aesthetic impact it could have on a community
1335720 i dont know it if the citys going to permit turbines or solar panels then i think it should be regulated you have to figure out the ramifications and what the real gains of it are
1335721 i know a guy that put little turbines on the side of his building to harvest updrafts there are all sorts of different ways to harness energy
1335722 you worry about the noise and you worry about the fact that we might end up looking like a pin cushion
1335723 whether its 10 turbines or 10 000 there needs to be control
1335724 id hate to see 200 built and then the city realizes gee we shouldve done something else instead

1335729 in general winds peak energy does not coincide with peak electricity demand its not a good match
1335730 its something we as a state and a nation need to say focused on
1335731 thats about what we should expect this time of the year
1335732 higher transmission and other charges associated with new wind generation will increase the electricity costs paid by all consumers
1335733 the best opportunities to build sustainable energy are on the south island other than geothermal
1335734 sustainable energy but they wont give us transmission pricing to make it happen
1335735 our membership is very excited about this it allows us to tap a world class resource that we have in b c
1335736 its important to recognize that wind is the fastest and newest form of energy generation worldwide
1335737 in pincher creek alberta theyve turned what everybody used to hate the wind into a resource
1335738 busloads of people are coming from calgary just to see the turbines
1335739 we would be concerned as a regional council if anything with this nullified communities input and the rights of communities to engage
1335740 theres been a lot of flak about substantial delays in consent hearings and how cumbersome the resource management process was
1335741 but the timeline in the environment court has been reduced and from a regional council view commissioners appointed to panels are highly qualified technically and legally that ensures a very equitable hearing to evaluate complex issues
1335742 the biggest to hit us recently is the central plains water irrigation scheme
1335743 could that be seen as one of critical importance what is critical
1335744 changes would need to be carefully handled it would create a two tier system a fast track for so called favoured projects and the normal process for other projects and it would depend on what criteria they use to define important projects
1335745 i think a lot of us are waiting to see more details about what they have in mind
1335746 we will include in our rma reforms this process of priority consenting and we will put in a legislative requirement that such consents will be processed within nine months it would make a huge difference
1335747 who decides what is nationally significant will be up to cabinet its important to emphasise that in the priority consenting process the decision maker will still need to give legal weight to what is in regional and district plans
1335748 everything nick smith does will remove the right of people to object and i dont accept the process necessarily takes too long
1335749 theres an element of risk that if you divorce local authorities from the process too much and we can be talking about 25 year plus projects if you get off to a bad start you can have a lot of ill feeling there for a long time
1335750 although it asserts directly that some models are useful and indirectly that others are not the statement tells as sic nothing as to which is which so it is not itself useful
1335751 tells as sic nothing as to which is which so it is not itself useful

1335756 a simplified representation of a system or phenomenon as in the sciences or economics with any hypotheses required to describe the system or explain the phenomenon often mathematically
1335757 i take from this the conclusion that mathematics is a model of a only a part of human cognition and neither this part nor its model match the universe completely
1335758 there are two aspects which are important having the right culture and having people who continually strive to improve their performance
1335759 the job of the manager is not so much calling for greater efforts as it is of getting rid of the restrictions
1335760 it is the attitude and leadership of the management which has greatest effect in raising and maintaining high performance

1335775 the wind blows and we might as well capitalize on it its just going to blow away if we dont
1335776 its not profitable right now to be in the cattle business theyre more of a liability than they are an asset at this point
1335777 this is a chance for us to control our own destiny
1335778 when we do this it makes us less dependable on foreign oil its a boost for the economy and we become self sufficient
1335779 my family has paid property taxes on this land for almost 100 years 95 plus years and nobody has ever offered us to pay for our view
1335780 we spend a lot of time in the wind and itll be nice to get even with it i guess
1335781 it would be formed after evidence is provided to us if we get evidence we will certainly get to the bottom of this do not forget we have been victims of terrorism also it is in our own interest to get to the bottom of this
1335782 we would like to see why such accusations are made we have told the indian government that we have lost troops there was firing from across the line of control
1335783 between the two prime ministers and foreign ministers there is a desire to carry the dialogue process forward we want to get going on various issues which are pending on both sides the november 2003 ceasefire understanding is the biggest confidence building measure between india and pakistan we have every intention to respect it and no intention to violate it
1335784 after the last meeting in colombo i think the record has been set straight there is a desire between the two countries to carry the process forward

1335792 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1335793 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1335794 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1335795 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1335796 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1335797 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1335798 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1335799 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1335800 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1335801 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1335802 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1335803 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1335804 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1335805 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1335806 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1335807 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1335808 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1335809 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1335810 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1335811 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1335812 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1335813 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1335814 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1335815 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1335816 was sent to new york on a project for the book
1335817 detained by federal agents in manhattan he was interrogated and his notes were confiscated violations of his first and fourth amendment rights

1335822 now with ni wi fi daq hardware developers can add wireless sensor capabilities to new and existing measurement applications without having to learn new software
1335823 no political party is presenting a clear picture and every one is playing vote bank politics at the cost of human lives
1335824 what we fail to understand what made bjp central leadership to fuel the fire in jammu only because of elections slated in the state it is most unfortunate that a political party claiming to form government at national level should play with the sentiments of people to meet their political ends
1335825 this attitude on the part of bjps central leadership is not understandable elections will come and go political parties will come and go but no political party should cross the lakshaman rekha to meet their political goals at the cost of unity of the state and country
1335826 our leaders go to any similar situation with a fire brigade to douse the fire whereas the bjp spares no effort to fuel the fire
1335827 hindu sentiments are as important as muslim sentiments nobody should say when we respect muslim sentiments they are genuine and when hindu sentiments are hurt they are communal
1335828 the state cabinet took these orders to make hindu community throughout the country happy because it had much more to offer to the pilgrims than the shrine board in the earlier cabinet decision to divert the land to the sri amarnath shrine board they had to make pre fabricated infrastructure only at two places whereas as per the second order such facilities would be created all along from jammu to the cave shrine nearly 400 kilometres
1335829 the muslims of kashmir are totally secular there may be different voices but they are not communal it is unfortunate that religious sentiments have been exploited by religious leaders for the past 60 years
1335830 many leaders emerged at the cost of exploiting peoples religious sentiments during the agitation over the temporary diversion of land to sasb
1335831 no political party came and spoke out the fact that the ownership of land squarely wrested with the state government and that the board was supposed to create pre fabricated infrastructure only during the pilgrimage period and dismantle them again for the rest of the year which means hardly anything
1335832 but some political parties spread the disinformation in the length and breadth of the valley that thousands of flats would be constructed on the land for yatris and in the next four to five years the demography of the state would change this disinformation spread like a wild fire across the valley and the political parties instead of talking truth to the people joined and became a part of disinformation
1335833 you have only one fuel that will reduce the oil imports and you have it in abundance
1335834 we dont believe natural gas makes a good transportation fuel
1335835 its just that pickenss scale is way off the charts
1335836 times have changed since we exited the business and given the current price of oil the economics may be different
1335837 i think we have 8 cars coming and 55 people on the list
1335838 in some cases we are not able to give people a full fill
1335839 were mindful of anything that has the potential of raising the price of natural gas

1335851 what motivates me the most is the chance to make history in brazilian football and win this first gold medal
1335852 we all know that if we win this medal we will make history
1335853 very few players have an opportunity to participate in two olympics and im glad im having this chance to win what we let slip away in the past
1335854 we need a good start to put us on the right track for the rest of the olympics
1335855 but that leaves open the question of why the fascination with obama
1335856 we are in awe of the fact that a black could be elected president of the us because america is so associated with racism yet underneath the deep anti us sentiment here is a desire to believe back in the sixties it was the same it was the rise of a movement among those who were disillusioned pro americans
1335857 amazement that young people here are actually following obama when he makes compromises and asking the same questions
1335858 the greek king believes that the papandreaou governments move to the left and the apparent rise of leftist activity are dangerous developments and that preventive action should begin now
1335859 the king wants papandreous image destroyed but he does not want to become involved or blamed if the attacks fail
1335860 embassy has concluded george papandreous return to power should be avoided if this can be done without a direct and open confrontation with him
1335861 the anti monarchists led by papandreou would draw some 70 to 80 percent of the vote
1335862 highly critical of andreas papandreou and his father as a fair reflection of the u s government view and were probably inspired by u s officials nyt july 28 aug 4 5 6 1965
1335863 democracy is indeed at the gunpoint and the sooner that the democratic progressive forces of the world perceive that situation the greater is the chance that the trigger will not be pulled

1335865 id much rather have a neteqd open connection than a nated nonmanaged one thats for sure
1335866 netequalizer never opens up any customer data and thus cannot be accused of spying connections are treated as a metered resource
1335867 the isps that use netequalizer simply put a policy in their service contracts stating how many connections they support end of story bittorrent is still allowed to run albeit not as wide with unlimited connections

1335892 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1335893 colorado is not alone in seeing an increase in the number of initiatives
1335894 anywhere from one half percent to one and a half percent more per issue
1335895 if there are enough people who sign petitions to get an issue on the ballot then its obviously a concern to many of them people have a right to be heard
1335896 our constitution has grown significantly in the last 20 years because of the initiative process
1335897 if voters want to create change they can do it by changing statutes not with constitutional measures
1335898 the initiative process was created to deal with corruption in government
1335899 with the ashes coming down its not a good thing
1335900 we are fighting erratic winds extreme fire behavior and very dry conditions
1335901 swirling winds really hampered our firefighters winds were shifting so rapidly throughout the day making it very dangerous for firefighters and for air support

1335910 its a portal in to understanding who we are and how our world works
1335911 dealing with todays asymmetric threat to u s and global security
1335912 we thank everyone who participated in the asymmetric threat symposium as well as our co sponsors at the national defense university and are very proud and privileged to have benefited from their insights with this symposium publication we make their views available to all the u s and the west are in a long term struggle over values ideas and culture not terrain and military power in the traditional sense i believe the development of an integrated national asymmetric threat strategy to address this struggle which we have begun to explore in this publication is both timely and urgent and of major national concern

1335914 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1335915 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1335916 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1335917 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1335918 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1335919 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1335920 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1335921 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1335922 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1335923 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1335924 most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1335925 the gas prices that are wiping out your pay cheques and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state
1335926 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1335927 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1335928 we should sell 70m barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1335929 allows space for more content and for high definition channels
1335930 we want to ensure our viewers get the best value for money in the switch to digital television more channels more services and better quality pictures
1335931 but i am confident that with all players working together and with public buy in digital television in ireland will offer new and exciting content and technology to the irish viewer
1335932 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1335933 that shows progress the extension is aimed at overcoming all the issues on the agenda the omen is very good
1335934 if a breakthrough is near it might not necessarily be because more people are now involved if anything i think the more the people the more difficult it might be to reach an agreement
1335935 but nothing is obvious in politics remember the original six negotiators have been at it for over a year now and have grown familiar which could cloud their views on certain issues and impinge on their efficiency
1335936 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1335937 what was given to solana was the telephone conversation transcript and not a response to the proposed package
1335938 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1335939 in the absence of a positive response we have no choice but to pursue further measures

1335948 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1335949 while the president can declare that congress must sit for an emergency session he cannot set the agenda only the leadership of the majority party can do that
1335950 clearly felt energized by their demand that speaker nancy pelosi d calif call the house back into session to vote on offshore oil drilling
1335951 showdown on capitol hill over expanding offshore drilling could lead to a threatened government shutdown when congress returns from its five week summer break in early september
1335952 finding an alternative catalyst that will allow us to do oxygen evolution breaking the bonds of water or h2o and forming oxygen in concert with hydrogen

1335954 the telephones you can get at a regular retail outlet just do not stand up to the rigors of a hotel room
1335955 guests are not going to treat them with the kindness they show for their own phones at home
1335956 weve hardened our phones by making the external case out of a high impact industrial plastic
1335957 we drop test the phone from 6 to 8 feet onto concrete and they dont break open

1335962 will then purchase the remaining interest from bertelsmann for approximately 600 million as a result bertelsmann will receive approximately 900 million in value for its 50 percent stake plus 300 million of its share of cash on sony bmgs balance sheet
1335963 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1335964 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential

1335975 si bien los latinos en estados unidos somos el segmento social que m s estamos creciendo tambi n ya somos la segunda comunidad m s afectada por la enfermedad a escala nacional despu s de la afroamericana sin embargo nuestra gente recibe poca atenci n m dica hay lugares como nueva york donde en los hospitales no se le pregunta a la persona su estatus migratorio pero es la excepci n en el resto del pa s no es as
1335976 uno de nuestros mayores problemas es hacer entender a la comunidad que el sida no es una enfermedad que afecta s lo a personas homosexuales sino a todos

1335978 in spite of difficult economic conditions in several of our key markets our parks performed reasonably well during the first half of 2008
1335979 through the end of the second quarter our parks entertained 7 6 million visitors average in park guest per capita spending was 40 45 and out of park revenues totaled 40 5 million this compares with attendance of 6 7 million average in park guest per capita spending of 40 68 and out of park revenues of 38 3 million through the second quarter of 2007
1335980 overall in light of the current economy we are satisfied with our results through the first half of the year
1335981 attendance and revenue trends continued to improve across all of our properties toward the end of june and through the peak vacation month of july over the next several months we will continue to introduce new marketing programs that add value to a park visit and attract families choosing to vacation closer to home
1335982 in general we are pleased with the performance of our parks through july
1335983 when we purchased the paramount parks in june of 2006 we believed these parks operated in stronger regional markets when compared with our legacy parks this geographic diversification has proven to be beneficial to us thus far as we continue to see strength in the toronto market along with the washington d c charlotte and san francisco markets these stronger markets have helped to balance some of the early season softness we experienced from the detroit cleveland and minneapolis st paul markets where several of our legacy parks operate
1335984 we ended the second quarter of 2008 in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow
1335985 although attendance and revenue expectations through july were higher than we achieved we are satisfied with our results particularly given the continued pressures on the discretionary dollar as a result of higher gas prices and current economic conditions
1335986 with approximately 45 of our budgeted attendance still ahead of us it is imperative that we continue the positive momentum we experienced during the month of july into the other peak vacation month of august and the important fall season we are hopeful we will continue to see growth in attendance while maintaining the in park guest per capita spending as families continue to look for entertainment closer to home at this time based on preliminary results through july we are reaffirming our full year guidance of net revenues between 990 million to 1 02 billion and full year adjusted ebitda between 340 355 million
1335987 there is nothing in our results to justify cds spreads of 1 000 basis points

1335996 you can get the universal treatment the moneys there now if we spend it most effectively
1335997 but we dont have the health care systems to reach out to people get them tested and diagnosed in a timely fashion get them on treatment and do the regular follow ups
1335998 to pretend we can ever get a hold of this without dealing with that the idea of unprotected sexual relations with unlimited numbers of partners i think would be naive

1336011 are you sure sometimes people dont think they are but just thinking that some people are so different like if youve never met any i mean thats a form of prejudice in my opinion
1336012 im just talking theoretically i mean its worth thinking about right instead of just accepting that most people arent prejudiced because we know its the wrong way to be maybe we should accept that most people are and start from there
1336013 hes like our servant he carries our bags he cooks us meals
1336014 we didnt even invite him to eat lunch with us
1336015 teddy told me about the operation and i just thought well i can tell you dont have anything there
1336016 it just didnt seem necessary it just seemed beside the point
1336017 it would just be a silver lining right new boobs like trading up for a new model
1336018 you told her i asked her to come in or not
1336019 but she lying there like dead only wont show her face also
1336020 the other day she thinking she a goat isnt it so we must treat her like goat only
1336021 go and beat her legs with the stick and tell her if she dont come in we going to lock the door she can sit outside and eat grass until morning
1336022 ive been four years at university madam i speak french and japanese as well
1336023 you must miss them when you are away like this
1336024 the day after my marriage i received my acceptance into the university my mother told me i had to stay with my wife in my village
1336025 my parents chose my wife for me i wanted to study
1336026 terribly sick but it turns out im not going to die after all at least not now maybe not for a long time the prognosis is life that was what my doctor told me his first joke in nearly two years
1336027 to ask for the oldest girl and tell them he would cancel half the debt in return
1336028 i told him its bad enough their mother died in childbirth even the older one will hardly know how to do anything i tell you but at the very least she might give you a son or two cooking cleaning housework all who do you think wouldve taught them i asked him their senile grandmother their aunties each one with eleven twelve children of their own on top of that he went and took the younger girl also
1336029 that one even a dog baby she wont have maddayan i told my great son why do you think the father has locked her away out of sight all these years nobody who goes to the house has ever laid eyes on that girl i think my son agreed to marry her because he could not control his hunger for young young girls you know what i asked him to his face next time a four year old also youll take for a wife is it thats what i asked him point blank just like that id had enough of it
1336030 the boy just looked at me like a buffalo like he also had no brains just like the girl hed picked hai hai what to do for nine months we carry our children in what pain we bear them and then they throw our wisdom in our face only even at that time i told him only the idiappam man has laid eyes on that girl one evening on his rounds he accidentally saw her and he also said there was something funny about her mind and body both stopped growing when she was five years old the idiappam man said but still my great son stood there and looked at me like i was talking chinese your other wives and i i told him mark my words i told him your other wives and i will have to take both girls and keep them on our heads only feed them bathe them put them to bed watch and see and sure enough what i said came true isnt it
1336031 what is this all night long hes going to let her sit and sing or what
1336032 so so you praying to your secret gods again is it
1336033 you want the whole town to think we have no food in the house or what how you think it looks hanh veloo saars wife eating rubbish from the dustbin
1336034 why not turn into a real goat once and for all
1336035 its the opposite this keeps the coolness next to the body
1336036 i mean it might be you know hard on you mom
1336037 and i need an adventure dont you think i think i deserve an adventure
1336038 that seems like a fine idea if youre up to it mimi
1336039 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants to inflate your tires
1336040 plus you shouldnt rely on him to go flying learn to fly yourself dammit
1336041 i would never destroy a perfectly good airplane in an effort to off myself
1336042 show people that they can get off of the drugs
1336043 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1336044 victory in war must be followed by a prosperous peace
1336045 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
1336046 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses
1336047 i will do everything in my power to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon everything
1336048 only casts a new infinitely repeated image through the hall of mirrors that is his political life and our media experience of that life
1336049 a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
1336050 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1336051 that it is better for the president to act without law and in so doing to explain and defend his actions by speaking openly to the people about the temporary necessities that require such actions
1336052 it has come to light that he had cocaine in his system
1336053 one of the effects of that is you do become reckless you do not perceive matters perilously
1336054 there are recorded incidents of people pulling in too sharply and of losing control of their vehicles whilst under the influence of that drug
1336055 there is a resolution we havent come to it but itll be resolved and steven will be a ram for probably the rest of his career
1336056 this is a international olympic committee ioc guideline under rule 51 of the charter which states that flags which can be interpreted as a political gesture are not allowed inside any olympic venues
1336057 and as such only flags which participate in the olympic games are allowed by the ioc
1336058 the minister for heritage believes that welsh athletes should be able to fly the welsh flag on a lap of honour if they wish
1336059 this has serious implications for freedom of expression and the rights of supporters and athletes to celebrate their success
1336060 welsh medal winning athletes and their supporters have been able to wave the welsh flag at previous olympics without the threat of having them confiscated
1336061 for as long as i can remember supporters of welsh athletes have waved the welsh flag at the olympic games
1336062 along with the union flag it is an important symbol to demonstrate their pride in wales role in the british team
1336063 it concerns me that this issue has not been dealt with adequately in the years running up to the beijing games by either the ioc or the games organisers
1336064 the olympic games is about celebrating pride in national achievement and must not be allowed to become an event which seeks to suppress it
1336065 these would be great results in any year this year they are exceptional
1336066 we have a strong and sustainable business guided by a clear and consistent strategy and we enter the second half in good shape
1336067 however our markets are being affected by inflation high energy and commodity prices and the consequences of the slowdown in the west
1336068 but as these results demonstrate our businesses have good momentum and we are pursuing our strategy with strength and confidence
1336069 we expect a moderation in asian growth rather than an interruption which will be more marked in some places than others
1336070 the economies of asia africa and the middle east are fundamentally much more resilient than in the late 1990s their rapid growth is driven by demographics urbanisation industrialisation and the opening up of markets
1336071 a deal of this size at this stage of the cycle is something of a brave move for adecco given the economic backdrop
1336072 adeccos stated strategy is to expand its professional operations in the u s europe and asia as well as looking at specialised general staffing companies
1336073 on valuation the rumoured 350 370 pence bid would still undervalue the long term prospects of the business long term fair value of our forecasts is 445 pence
1336074 michael pages management reputation and track record is good and they will be able to make a strong case for the independent organic growth story

1336103 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1336104 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
1336105 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
1336106 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
1336107 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements

1336113 in the solar industry a 1 percent efficiency improvement is a big deal
1336114 ill be happy if we can get 2 to 3 percent more efficiency
1336115 its not like solar is trying to take the place of oil
1336116 but if in 20 to 30 years solar can provide 5 to 10 percent of the world energy supply then solar would be a huge industry bigger than the entire microelectronics industry

1336121 as part of our share in tackling climate change camden council works with and encourages all our contractors to make sure they are providing services that are as sustainable as possible
1336122 the average household bin is one third food waste rather than send it to landfill or an incinerator we can turn it into a gas called biomethane and run our municipal vehicle fleet on it biomethane means virtually no carbon or noxious emissions so its good for the environment and for our air quality this seemed like a dream 18 months ago when camdens sustainability taskforce suggested it but now were trialling both food waste collections and biomethane in our vehicles its a sign that the council is serious about cutting the carbon out of camden
1336123 the gas we use to make the cbm for this vehicle comes from a landfill site in albury surrey which began production in june 2008 in creating and selling this fuel product we recover the latent energy stored in material discarded by society providing power particularly suited to vehicles operating in the urban environment
1336124 cbm has excellent potential to provide at least some of our vehicles with a fuel that reduces climate change impacts and contributes to reducing our dependence on mineral fuels we have to look at environmentally friendly alternatives for our operations and gas powered vehicles are one of those developing technologies we are keen to assess

1336128 why do people focus on hijab on the outside so much theres much bigger problems going on in our religion
1336129 look at saudi arabia and all the problems it has they keep focusing on women covering women covering but then look at all the fasaad thats happening over there thats what you get when you lose perspective and priorities are such out of place and the focus is only on the superficial things

1336134 i know as a teacher now and as someone who has more experience i dont ever want to put my kids in a position of feeling like the situation is not under control that is what i regret
1336135 so for me to leave to better myself as an educator and then go take that somewhere else i didnt feel right doing that
1336136 it is like you invested in me when i was inexperienced now that i am gaining more experience i am going to reinvest it where you invested in me that is why i had to be at young
1336137 i think the hardest thing with the students was building back up that professional distance where i am the teacher and you are the student and i need you to respect me as such
1336138 because they had seen a personal side of me that they havent seen with their other teachers
1336139 part of my transition is learning how to take the emotion out of it and being the professional one in the room who is not reacting emotionally but who is being a disciplinarian
1336140 every year that is becoming more and more refined i am less anxious i am more secure in the role
1336141 she was a little strict but now she is fun

1336144 my mom calls me dad and im like im just a little boy
1336145 i worry because he is trying to make it on his own
1336146 he is making these choices that could affect his life and i understand but it scares me stephens personality type is that of a good solider he is quiet reserved he will do what he is told it makes me a little nervous but he is doing well
1336147 more than anything i want to give him a hug
1336148 im glad he was taken out of a bad situation because we were told he was not being cared for at all
1336149 i would have liked to continue to be a help to him
1336150 that was one profession that i can recall saying no i wont ever do that
1336151 i would see the way kids gave their teachers such a hard time
1336152 at the same time we had talked to our daughters from the time they were able to listen about how important it was to give back to the community and how good it is to have pride in oneself and where one came from and to follow a passion you have all those things outweighed the parental trepidation
1336153 was so sweet always and had these cute little pigtails
1336154 that might be one of the biggest honors you could have in your teaching career
1336155 that is one thing that needs to be part of the teaching profession anyway
1336156 they always talk about recording videotaping and reflecting and looking back well that is an exercise i have been engaging in now for three years and i am really grateful for it

1336182 rafael van der vaart es la primera incorporaci n de este a o y seguramente la nica consideramos que la plantilla es de mucha calidad de mucho talento un equipo que es una gran familia muy unida
1336183 rafael van der vaart s lo tiene 25 a os y desde los 17 juega en primera divisi n primero en el ajax y luego en el hamburgo ha ganado dos ligas una copa y una supercopa y es a decir de los t cnicos un jugador de extraordinaria calidad un medio defensivo que marca goles y que nos va a ayudar mucho esta temporada
1336184 dijimos que las incorporaciones ser an muy pocas y muy buenas era l gico despu s de que estos dos a os de xitos en los que se han incorporado 19 jugadores j venes y comprometidos era una exigencia de esta junta directiva
1336185 aqu han jugado los mejores del mundo tu vas a ser uno de ellos ser una gran experiencia es un club exigente donde juega gente muy comprometida y entregada te deseo lo mejor y esperamos que te sientas como en casa
1336186 ahora quiero pasar pagina hay gente nueva y lo nico que quiero es tranquilidad y dar lo mejor para que se hable de m s lo por lo deportivo
1336187 hubiera tenido que salir de forma urgente porque no pod a estar m s minutos con gente para la que no soy de su agrado
1336188 hay gente nueva que apuesta porque contin e y creo que en la decisi n que se tome al final vamos a ir de la mano y esperemos que sea buena para las dos partes todo parece tener otro aire mas positivo
1336189 a d a de hoy soy jugador del valencia y si salgo ser a por una cosa que me gustara mucho o por aventura en el extranjero pero ahora mi postura es la de entrenar tranquilo y al margen de lo que va mas all de lo deportivo
1336190 habr gente que no entienda mi manera de defenderme por una decisi n que yo no tom pero a n no se ha dicho el motivo de aquello si no hubi ramos estado peleando por el descenso quiz s ahora los tres ser amos considerados el c ncer del valencia pero afortunadamente la gente que tom esas decisiones ya no est en el club
1336191 la nica manera de contrarrestar la opini n de la gente que no crea en m o piense que yo no debo estar es rindiendo a un buen nivel deportivo eso es lo nico que hace olvidar todo a la gente y ese es el camino que debo seguir creo que ha pasado y no tiene sentido volver atr s
1336192 para jugar en el valencia no me hace falta llevar el brazalete porque no me hace rendir mejor
1336193 la tranquilidad que busco pasa por no llevar la capitan a y no asumir cosas que antes asum a para centrarme en lo deportivo y nada m s

1336206 soy un futbolista profesional cada partido y cada traspaso supone un nuevo comienzo estoy contento de tener este tipo de comienzos
1336207 con ronaldinho en el equipo la calidad es la misma que la de la selecci n absoluta las nica diferencia es que s lo hemos dispuesto de quince d as para preparar al equipo
1336208 l quiere quedarse en el valencia a partir de ah ya veremos qu es lo que pasa pero quedarse en el valencia es su primera opci n luego si surgen otras posibilidades ya las analizaremos pero de momento esta muy a gusto aqu si en los pr ximos d as surge algo que no est en esta direcci n ya tendremos que valorarlo y entrar a tomar decisiones
1336209 david quiere quedarse y tiene contrato en vigor se han interesado por l muchos clubes por eso quiere que le demuestren en el valencia que le valoran es normal pero l quiere quedarse
1336210 porque es un jugador que ha hecho dos temporadas muy buenas jug la eurocopa y tambi n lo hizo muy bien y es normal que por un jugador que destaca de esta manera haya ofertas
1336211 pero no hemos valorado nada porque el que tiene los derechos federativos de david es el valencia y si ellos no nos dicen nada es jugador del valencia por cinco a os

1336243 if there were no obscurity man would not feel his corruption if there were no light man could not hope for a cure thus it is not only right but useful for us that god should be partly concealed and partly revealed since it is equally dangerous for man to know god without knowing his own wretchedness as to know his wretchedness without knowing god

1336251 both segments wholesale and consumer banking grew by healthy margins in the first half we expect a similar growth in the coming months as well sme consumer finance and transaction banking business would be amongst the key growth drivers
1336252 the financial implications are huge the state will lose over rs 300 crore per anum if the rice supplied through the public distribution system pds is further subsidised we cannot afford this when resource mobilistion is turning out to be a problem
1336253 when i made the promise the price of rice was rs 13 50 per kg in the open market we could have supported the rs 2 per kg scheme at that price but a kilogram of rice now costs over rs 20 and that makes it difficult for us to commence the scheme
1336254 when we are finding it difficult to absorb this how can we think of reducing the price to rs 2 per kg
1336255 populist measures can be counter productive too for parties in power what is the point in offering sops when there are not enough resources
1336256 we are implementing several other welfare programmes for the poor in lieu of the rice scheme we have also decided to pay rs 2 per litre of milk to dairy farmers
1336257 advaniji told the pm and sonia gandhi that some corrective measures were required to bring the situation back to normal
1336258 the monsoon session is scheduled to start on august 11 for which notification was necessary on or before july 28 last two weeks before the session but the government did not make any notification till today sensing that it has no political majority in parliament
1336259 the us was not ready to sew up a deal because of a lame duck president who does not have a fast track authority and i therefore expect the wto talks to begin in full earnest in mid 2009 when there is a new us administration
1336260 the flopped geneva meeting has however removed the envelope thus i feel that it did achieve some progress so that the glass is half full and not half empty
1336261 thus it needs much more time as it involves greater depth and many more concessions from rich countries like us and eu and advanced developing countries like india and china

1336263 the combination of multimedia and cooperative learning has proven to be consistently popular with the students

1336268 for the past year i have tried to find a lawyer and i find no one wants to be my lawyer all the lawyers say is we have a case and they need 5 000 to start off with the work and we dont have that kind of money
1336269 and i really in my heart believe that the surry county sheriffs department is going to get away with it
1336270 i drive about 35 miles round trip to work every day so this recycle made a good deal on my gas tank
1336271 i put most of it in my tank over half of it in my gas tank and thatll last me two weeks worth of going to work and back
1336272 theyre bringing in everything theyre bringing in scrap iron and steel aluminum brass stainless steel
1336273 just as were speaking a pickup truck is coming across our scale with some farm equipment and some old barbed wire fence
1336274 they get money here and they supplement their income and pay for their food and their fuel and their rent and everything else
1336275 a year or two ago im sure i would have probably just went out to dinner or maybe even went to the movies or something to that effect rather than filling up my tank
1336276 it used to all be for my kids now i use some to pay for gas
1336277 theres a lot of 80 year old farm stuff in the fields from what ive seen people drag in
1336278 we have real collectors with 200 pounds and the little grandmother bringing them down in the back of her cadillac five pounds at a time
1336279 the economy only puts more pressure on people to save money and conserve resources
1336280 people of a certain economic status are willing to turn anything over for cash
1336281 theyre going to pick up the old radiator theyre going to pick up the old swing and bring it to recycle

1336288 will then purchase the remaining interest from bertelsmann for approximately 600 million as a result bertelsmann will receive approximately 900 million in value for its 50 percent stake plus 300 million of its share of cash on sony bmgs balance sheet
1336289 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1336290 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1336291 music has been a vital and vibrant part of sonys culture for over 20 years this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates
1336292 the many new distribution paths are causing an increase in the demand for music use rights
1336293 in view of this fact we believe that building a business for the management and exploitation of such rights in europe is an attractive proposition we want to take advantage of our opportunities and position ourselves with the strong well established bmg brand and a management that is highly regarded in the market

1336301 now with the launch of rsa services in jaipur kolkata ahmedabad and coimbatore ford owners in these cities have the reassurance that they can call upon this premium service for immediate assistance round the clock
1336302 its sad its really said nothing ever happened over here since ive been here so its kind of devastating
1336303 the big reason were seeing a decrease is because of demand decreasing
1336304 motorists are driving less and its based on the high cost of gasoline
1336305 its still a significant increase in the cost of gasoline
1336306 we think that the caution will continue it needs to drop a lot more before motorists are going to change their driving habits and pick up driving at the rate they were before
1336307 i think her chances of making it through the final round are very good because her act is different than the other acts on there
1336308 their act allows them to change things up there are some wonderful singers on the show but thats all they can do is sing dean and alex can turn into characters incorporate martial arts and drama to change it up
1336309 we thought the show could help us do that better
1336310 a lot of the stuff we do is movie style fighting what we are trying to say is you can have a lot of fun and still learn self defense
1336311 alex was 6 or 7 when she started competing thats all shes done since she was in diapers dean has always competed they lived it and breathed it all their lives
1336312 when dean was a little boy the rambo movie came out and that tricked his trigger
1336313 he started practicing in the yard he would walk around with his camouflage on swinging his nun chucks
1336314 you turn on that rocky music and she would start those kick and punches
1336315 if they go all the way its one of those rag to riches stories i was single mother raising two boys when dean opened his martial center elite combat in galax it was a struggle getting people involved i couldnt imagine what it would be for them to win i cant comprehend it yet
1336316 i had a person who loved playing crib but he was losing his vision by adapting both the deck of cards and the crib board he was able to keep playing i also take people on outings to keep them involved in their community
1336317 i have two brothers one older and one younger and my parents always kept us really busy that way they knew where we were
1336318 i wanted to play but they didnt have a team that summer for my age group my parents coached t ball and my mom coached cross country running as well my dad told me coaching was the next best thing to playing so i coached the under eights that summer and i completed my referee certification
1336319 i had done my internship in yarmouth hospital with a ctrs who has been a huge advocate for recreation therapy in our area when this new therapeutic unit was accepted for digby hospital they knew that a recreation therapist would be an important part of the team
1336320 and my girls are expected to be respectful to refs and to other players
1336321 there are only a few areas that need to be raised
1336322 every year we do a community profile so we try to make them judges aware of things we think will move forward
1336323 we were all set to release the second one with them radiate records and then they got bought up by some sort of investment firm and we joined about half of their employees in redundancy we sort of managed to get the deal on the coat tails of clap your hands say yeah and arcade fires success and when we didnt pan out the way they did i think it was just a business position
1336324 theres a lot more to listen for on this album than the last one depth is a good word to use we put a lot of time into just making sure we could cram it full with these parts so that none of them contrasted so its harmonious
1336325 there was a really bad storm and the people on the island couldnt help them at all because they only had little boats and the ocean was really bad
1336326 when it sunk the next afternoon they could hear the people crying and there wasnt one survivor
1336327 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others
1336328 trust yourself create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement

1336332 they peel the wetsuit off you after you come out of the water everything fell into place i felt great it was a really well organized race
1336333 to have 250 300 athletes going into the water at the same time ive never been to a race that big
1336334 and its like they told me if you think this is big wait until you go to worlds
1336335 i dont want to get hurt so i just kind of go to the side of the group and i have lots of room
1336336 cindy was really good even the day before the race she was telling me where we were going to come out of the water and go into the change tents and where the run was going to be mentally its such a relief to know that before the actual day because its overwhelming
1336337 when you come from a small place like yarmouth and you go to these larger races it can be pretty intimidating
1336338 there are a lot of pro athletes and really fast athletes there and everybody sort of looks like they know what theyre doing
1336339 when you start in the water with 2 500 people thats pretty intimidating
1336340 i thought that would be the ultimate challenge to be able to swim bike and run

1336347 there continues to be price pressure in the used van market as average values continue to fall across the board the average value across all sectors dropped to 3 499 in june a fall of nearly 200 on mays figure and the biggest monthly drop we have seen this year average values have fallen by more than 350 compared to those recorded in january 2008
1336348 the market has now been slowing for most of the year a situation we have not encountered in the lcv market for some considerable time buyers are still about in the same numbers but buying patterns are patchy with a definite two tier market developing of saleable good quality stock that is sensibly valued and difficult to place poorer quality vans that appear over valued in comparison
1336349 we continue to see examples of well presented ready to retail vans making exceptional values as everybody wants these vehicles and buyers are paying very strong money to secure them even so unless buyers already have a home for the van there may be some hesitance in bidding much above the 7 000 mark
1336350 away from the very best of the premium stock it is very much a buyers market with sellers having to look at price to stimulate demand when there is a wealth of choice of similarly specified or condition vans

1336378 ive worked to improve education at all levels and supported the creation of the seed scholarship program which gives all delaware students access to earning a degree at delaware tech with a pathway to the university of delaware
1336379 a priority for me when im governor is to create a pathway for students to attend delaware state university as part of that program
1336380 now it may be that the answer is he tried but was rebuffed by governor minner and the general assembly
1336381 the logbooks kept by every naval ship ranging from nelsons victory and cooks endeavour down to the humblest frigate are emerging as one of the worlds best sources for long term weather data the discovery has been made by a group of british academics and met office scientists who are seeking new ways to plot historic changes in climate
1336382 a preliminary study of 6 000 logbooks has produced results that raise questions about climate change theories one paper published by dr dennis wheeler a sunderland university geographer in the journal the holocene details a surge in the frequency of summer storms over britain in the 1680s and 1690s many scientists believe storms are a consequence of global warming but these were the coldest decades of the so called little ice age that hit europe from about 1600 to 1850 wheeler and his colleagues have since won european union funding to extend this research to 1750 this shows that during the 1730s europe underwent a period of rapid warming similar to that recorded recently and which must have had natural origins
1336383 i still have plenty of tournaments to do well in and i hope i can start here at the olympics and fulfil my dream to win gold

1336389 the news of that abject surrender provoked an explosion of outrage across jammu
1336390 the governor has violated the sasb act he cannot act unilaterally any decision of the board has to be endorsed by at least five members
1336391 he is also in contempt of the high court which had passed an interim order approving the transfer of 800 kanals of land to the board in baltal
1336392 i dont recall such a massive bandh in recent years
1336393 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley anymore jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
1336394 vohra did neither he only added fuel to the fire he has been insensitive and his actions have only served to provoke the protesters
1336395 years of neglect of jammu by kashmir has resulted in what you are seeing today the people are frustrated the pandits have at last found a platform to vent their anger jammu has more people than kashmir but the lions share always goes to the valley
1336396 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley
1336397 it was his way of registering his protest against omar abdullahs speech in parliament he was incensed by the national conference leaders duplicity
1336398 tried to cremate it using old tyres kerosene oil and liquor
1336399 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1336400 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1336401 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten into extinction
1336402 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date

1336411 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1336412 to ensure that its judgment has its intended effect of guiding the political branches to a constitutionally permissible method of complying with the nations treaty obligations
1336413 executing jose medellin in violation of an order by the world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law
1336414 if the united states ignores its legal obligations in this case it will be tough to argue that other countries should respect the rights of us citizens

1336485 most groups have ended because 1 they joined the political process or 2 local police and intelligence agencies arrested or killed key members military force has rarely been the primary reason for the end of terrorist groups
1336486 that cannot or will not make a transition to nonviolence policing is likely to be the most effective strategy
1336487 a fter september 11 2001 the u s strategy against al qaida centered on the use of military force
1336488 u s policymakers and key national security documents referred to operations against al qaida as the war on terrorism emphasis in original
1336489 the evidence by 2008 suggested that the u s strategy was not successful in undermining al qaidas capabilities
1336490 resurgence should trigger a fundamental rethinking of u s counterterrorism strategy
1336491 policing and intelligence should be the backbone of u s efforts
1336492 military force may be a necessary instrument when is involved in an insurgency
1336493 they have a better understanding of the operating environment even if they need to develop the capacity to deal with insurgent groups over the long run
1336494 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
1336495 economic political and social development in vulnerable corners of the world
1336496 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development
1336497 the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves

1336500 the industry uses teasers to draw in students however these can often detract from the core features in a lot of cases the overdraft element will prove to be far more relevant for students in general overdraft limits are increased year by year although the latest halifax bank of scotland account can offer up to 3 000 from day one
1336501 students need to remember the golden rule though that overdrafts will need to be paid back at some stage
1336502 the likelihood is we will see many more products launching before the new term starts but students should make sure they dont get seduced by headline rates and flashy giveaways

1336509 there has been an increase in the number of coyote reports that have come in
1336510 fortunately we dont have any reports of attacks on people
1336511 the issue of coyotes attacking pets is probably a larger concern to most people than the relatively rare concern of attacks on humans
1336512 if you see a lot of notices of missing pets that is usually an indicator that there is coyote activity
1336513 some people are up in arms because their pets are attacked
1336514 other people who are not affected think that coyotes are wonderful and cute but also think they are scrawny and need a little bit of a handout
1336515 if it would have grabbed my dog i would have been more concerned
1336516 ill read an excerpt from the book out loud to them about the whomping willow and then ill ask them can plants move and sometimes theyll say no sometimes theyll mention venus flytraps

1336518 for the first six or seven days of the workshop the kids are run through a newtons laws boot camp of sorts

1336524 a few politicians threw a large sum of cash in parliament and alleged that there was an attempt to bribe them for their vote this confirms the continued existence of a parallel banking system popularly called as hawala
1336525 according to indian observers funds transferred through the hawala market are between 30 to 40 percent of the formal market
1336526 it is a fact that the samajwadi party is not demanding any ministerial berths
1336527 for some reason or other these organizations dont lay it on the line because they dont know what is going on on the streets
1336528 this is a serious crisis and the so called experts are missing it

1336532 we have obtained seven sketches of suspects who could be involved in the jaipur bomb blasts we are studying them for links with the ahmedabad serial blasts
1336533 we are still investigating the cases there are some leads which may suggest involvement of local simi workers we are still looking for concrete evidence in the cases
1336534 try to overhear the conversation and if any suspicious activity is noticed inform police immediately and keep a watch over the person keep an eye on persons making calls on isd codes 008801 bangladesh 0092 pakistan 09977 nepal and local codes 0191 jammu and 0194 srinagar
1336535 the cops come daily to my shop and check the register to see whether we are maintaining a record a constable then signs and put the date at the end of the particular days record
1336536 watch is to be kept on persons using guesthouses and they have to obtain photo identification cards of users and local contacts in case of a person belonging to another state or country
1336537 terror threat increases manifold during the time of independence day and republic day so we are asking each and every person to remain vigilant and report any suspicious matter to police
1336538 if we dont keep their phone call records it is very likely that the terrorists may escape easily after executing blasts in the city we appeal to people to cooperate with the police
1336539 we are very particular about cyber cafes after the series of blasts in jaipur bangalore and ahmedabad the terrorists have used cyber cafes before executing the blasts
1336540 in ahmedabad terrorists did not spare hospitals and they exploded bombs there when media people and relatives of affected persons in the bomb blasts gathered in the hospital
1336541 in view of the terrorist attacks on hospitals we have written letters to aiims and safdarjung hospitals for strengthening security in and around their premises

1336597 if events develop according to the worst case violence scenario russia will not allow itself to remain indifferent considering that russian citizens live in south ossetia particularly in the conflict zone
1336598 if events continue to develop in this way if the attitude is not changed this wont lead to anything good
1336599 i dont want to make any grim predictions but if such events are repeated the situation may spiral out of control and lead to sad consequences

1336615 all i did is basically told them the very basic information that we knew at the time
1336616 its important to leaders of the communities to explain to them what happened i think its important to bridge that gap as much as possible and with all groups
1336617 i believe its getting better but weve got a ways to go theres no doubt about it
1336618 why they shot him was wrong thats all we have to say for now
1336619 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1336620 that shows progress the extension is aimed at overcoming all the issues on the agenda the omen is very good
1336621 if a breakthrough is near it might not necessarily be because more people are now involved if anything i think the more the people the more difficult it might be to reach an agreement
1336622 but nothing is obvious in politics remember the original six negotiators have been at it for over a year now and have grown familiar which could cloud their views on certain issues and impinge on their efficiency
1336623 the gift baskets contained products from bunnies by the bay their blankets outfits bibs toys and bunnies

1336633 america is often portrayed as an ignorant unsophisticated sort of place full of bible bashers and ruled to a dangerous extent by trashy television superstition and religious bigotry a place lacking in respect for evidence based knowledge i know that is how it is portrayed because i have done my bit to paint that picture
1336634 i will do everything in my power to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon everything
1336635 only casts a new infinitely repeated image through the hall of mirrors that is his political life and our media experience of that life

1336650 on june 29th two dozen high school juniors from across the country converged on rits school of print media for the 2008 publishing and advertising experience they knew that they were going to be taking part in a three day intensive workshop learning traditional and electronic publishing techniques from rits professors
1336651 what they didnt know was the challenge that awaited them

1336656 we have to stop it man enough is enough man innocent children are falling down
1336657 displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
1336658 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1336659 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1336660 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1336661 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence

1336680 orang kristen seharusnya tidak boleh menerima asumsi kapitalis yang mengatakan bahwa kecakapan yang hebat atau pemilikan sumber sumber membuat seseorang menghabiskan uang yang sepadan keputusan keputusan yang berkaitan dengan pemakaian uang seharusnya dimulai dengan suatu pertimbangan akan kebutuhan bukan dengan jumlah penghasilan yang harus dibelanjakan

1336691 la situaci n no pinta nada bien para los trabajadores activos o parados ni para los pensionistas las viudas los inmigrantes o los j venes precarios o sin empleo es decir para los de abajo que son los que siempre pagan y sufren los efectos de las crisis y que son los que menos posibilidades tienen para desarrollar una vida con un m nimo de dignidad

1336735 bruce hoffman phd is a professor at georgetown universitys edmund a walsh school of foreign service and a senior fellow at the combating terrorism center u s military academy at west point
1336736 terrorism is the deliberate creation and exploitation of fear in the attainment of political change it is thus undeniably a form of psychological warfare
1336737 terrorists use violence or equally important wield the threat of violence because they believe that only through brutal mayhem can their cause triumph and long term political aims be attained operations are therefore deliberately planned to shock impress and intimidate ensuring that their acts are sufficiently daring and bloody enough to capture the attention of the media and in turn the public and government as well thus rather than being seen as indiscriminate or senseless terrorism is actually a very deliberate and planned application of violence
1336738 activities that involve violent or life threatening acts that are a violation of the criminal laws of the united states or of any state and appear to be intended i to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ii to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion or iii to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction assassination or kidnapping and c occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the united states or c occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states
1336739 unless the government of the united states its military or those acting on its behalf are the perpetrators of said methods
1336740 thus rather than being seen as indiscriminate or senseless terrorism is actually a very deliberate and planned application of violence

1336742 the priest who recorded and passed on the pythias words was known as the prophetes this individual did not foretell the future but was simply the gods mouthpiece or medium of communication the relationship between the phophetes and the pythia is obscure if his sole function was to formulate the pythias answers in intelligible terms her wide knowledge of human political and even geographical questions bordered on the miraculous nillsons view is that the prophetes either elaborated on the pythicas utterances and put them into plain speech or actually gave her guidance on her answers there is no full solution to the problem but we know that the oracular priest were anything but charlatans and frauds

1336823 i am finally back from hawaii and slowly transitioning to central standard time today i have asked phil brinkmeyer director of ministry development for africa to write about the provision of water for children and families in kenya
1336824 clean water is a basic necessity to humanity and is also a means of evangelism to the people buckner ministers to everyday
1336825 buckner offers its services within the poorest of the poor communities where access to clean water is merely a pipe dream
1336826 without water wells building facilities and programs would be too costly as it would involve transporting water by truck from rivers a distance away
1336827 everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but whoever drinks of the water that i will give him will never be thirsty forever

1336862 the line where the wolf range is drawn now really matches up not just with the forested area but the area where road densities really increase to the south
1336863 if wolves could tolerate each other at higher densities there would maybe be more wolves but it appears that they have reached that limit

1336868 gene doping is the next major headache for the world of sport
1336869 in 2004 people were starting to talk about its use at the athens olympics this year in beijing the case is even stronger that this will be the first genetically modified games many scientists will say its still not possible but im not taking this for granted we need to assume that its happening its already feasible
1336870 there is no other technology that is likely to change the olympics more than gene doping its not possible to detect and theres a good chance that it will never be detectable in any meaningful sense
1336871 this forces the world of sport to reconsider what it does about testing its time for their plans to change its time for the era of human enhancement to take full effect in the olympics
1336872 london 2012 should be watching beijing very carefully to see whats possible there has never been a clean olympics
1336873 the main problem for sports is that there are so many technologies that are under the radar of anti doping that its policies do little more than to point us to successes of anti doping testing
1336874 yes we have no experience with sports people here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
1336875 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks
1336876 i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
1336877 we have to believe that athletes will try anything to get an edge and this might occur at the olympics and we work on that basis
1336878 i doubt wayne will be fit for the start of the season

1336886 the charge of the knights operation in basra was planned led and executed by the iraqis
1336887 there was no accommodation which prevented uk troops from entering basra the reason why troops were not sent in immediately was because there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in to start mentoring the iraqi troops
1336888 the success of the mission made it clear that to build on the confidence and experience gained by 14 division a more specialised training approach could be delivered out on the ground in basra and the uk military transition teams mitts were introduced

1336905 a lot of games out here and ive never heard that before ive never heard that boomer go out across the street
1336906 ive been coming out here for 30 years ive never seen anything like it
1336907 at least they told us to get out they warned us and told us to get going
1336908 the rain started coming down they started covering the field and about 10 minutes later they asked us to move towards cover and then we started hearing the tornado sirens go off
1336909 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1336910 i dont think anything will be getting out of chicago tonight
1336911 the wind picked up and in probably five seconds it blew my friend into her husband
1336912 he grabbed her and pulled her inside and we all ran down the stairs it was like dead still and then within five seconds 10 seconds we were all blown away
1336913 we have about 270 crews out theyve been working throughout the night
1336914 as of this point weve restored power to 165 000 customers but the work will continue 24 hours until we get this done
1336915 at this point were still saying its a multiple day restoration were asking a lot of our customers to be patient as we work on clearing all the damage and restoring power
1336916 well get a better idea as work goes throughout the day on the extent of damage and then have a better idea on when the last customer will be restored

1336920 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1336921 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1336922 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1336923 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1336924 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1336925 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1336926 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1336927 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1336928 here every creed and race find an equal place but there is no solidarity only the africans celebrate the fact that they are free only the indians celebrate the fact that they arrived what is the point of being cosmopolitan if we cant even be bothered to share our triumphs and our failures
1336929 i doubt wayne will be fit for the start of the season
1336930 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one hes not been back in training yet
1336931 we are going to try to get to know each other and maybe try not to be this daddy and daughter but to be there for each other as friends in the coming years
1336932 has grown up with the teaching of very angry militant white and black people the rev
1336933 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
1336934 if mr obama had his way he would have pulled our troops from iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies and while a misleading portrait of mr obama is being perpetrated by a media controlled by the democrats the obama camp has sent out people to attack the greatness of sen john mccain whose suffering and courage in a hanoi prison camp is an american legend
1336935 theres not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb
1336936 if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way
1336937 asked what are the qualifications of this man to become president of the united states i find him wanting and i expressed some of that and my concerns i sat there and i watched this thing and i just came to a point where i said boy somebodys gotta start talking about some of the real stuff and thats what i felt and thats what i did
1336938 his inexperience and lack of judgment some of that is indicated by the friendships and mentors he had growing up we should be very concerned about it
1336939 a little angry mail but ive had a lot of support from the other side of things too people who have side they appreciated my stating some of this stuff
1336940 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1336941 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1336942 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1336943 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1336944 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1336945 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1336946 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1336947 i mean this is a closed society in many ways
1336948 the internet provides interesting opportunities for people to express themselves sometimes its open sometimes the filters are there ive talked to the evangelicals who go there who feel like the underground church movement has gotten a few steps forward a step and a half back its really hard to tell
1336949 in terms of effectiveness the so called quiet behind the scenes diplomacy so far is a failure
1336950 on the human rights front as we approach the olympics china really has the worst record and is deteriorating up until today
1336951 the lesson of the ep3 was that its really important to be in a position to have quick communications with a nation as large and as important as china
1336952 they have tested they havent just defied the united states theyve defied you too china
1336953 thats to be seen but i know that theres a structure in place that will make it more likely they will because not only do you have the united states speaking out now you have china speaking out

1336960 you can see that the arrears for together are substantially higher than for the standard product
1336961 the chancellor and the government were totally irresponsible for failing to heed my warnings from last october that the bank should be stopped from giving out 125 together mortgages these shocking figures show northern rock has 6 3bn in unsecured loans it was clear even then that they could never be repaid in a falling housing market
1336962 alistair darling assured parliament that taxpayer loans to northern rock would be fully secured on mortgage assets this is clearly not true
1336963 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1336964 gordon brown and alistair darling promised taxpayers the loan to northern rock would be repaid in full but now just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1336965 you need to bear in mind that the eu state aid rules do not allow for a drip feed of capital into the bank we have selected an amount that we believe is comfortable for the whole period of temporary public ownership
1336966 our ultimatum has ended now they have made a strike and it is our turn to strike whether it will be tomorrow the day after tomorrow or whenever

1336997 we carefully reviewed the available evidence to measure the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1336998 at this point we recommend that men concerned about prostate cancer talk with their health care providers to make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference
1336999 prostate specific antigen screening is associated with psychological harms and its potential benefits remain uncertain
1337000 the economy may already be in recession yet the monetary policy committee feels unable to act given that inflation is well above target and rising
1337001 these figures will do nothing to quell fears that the economy is sliding toward negative growth and the prospect of a technical recession looks increasingly likely
1337002 the iraqi government calls upon all parties and groups in kirkuk province to refrain from carrying out any actions that might harm the national unity
1337003 the iraqi government is stressing its opposition to any unilateral measure to change the status of kirkuk
1337004 the decision will cause problems inside of the city and its illegal
1337005 its become seriously more difficult over the last week to reach some kind of political agreement
1337006 reflects understandable impatience at the failure of the iraqi government to implement article 140
1337007 simply because theyve lost so much money in the last eight months

1337149 we want to generate the feeling of everything getting worse its part of our narrative it makes the more gloomy part of the game a place where the stakes get higher

1337327 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1337328 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1337329 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight
1337330 even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first

1337414 i had called him after he had won the nomination we joked about the fact that if youd asked the pundits a year ago who were going to be the two nominees it wouldnt have been me and john mccain
1337415 and we pledged to have a substantive debate a debate thats not personal but is about our respective visions for the country

1337420 it is my intention to prepare a rule 43 report to the lord chancellor concerning obstructive sleep apnoea in an endeavour to reduce the number of deaths that arise annually from this condition
1337421 we are pleased that the coroner will be alerting the government to the dangers of sleep apnoea and we look forward to seeing the details of his report
1337422 i was disappointed by the outcome but i am so privileged to have been able to do this and it is a great country and what we need to do is start acting like americans that can solve problems and do our best to make sure this country stays great and thats what im going to do in the senate
1337423 it has been an honor and a privilege to have run as a senator from new york for the presidency and i was so proud as i went around the country to talk about new york and i hope maybe dispel some myths and disabuse people of some of their inaccurate information about our city and our state and so it was in all ways extraordinary and an incredibly personal honor and i now am out as many of you are campaigning for senator obama working to make sure we can carry on this campaign and the causes and issues that are near and dear to us
1337424 i was very touched by mikes concern for me over these last months every since the campaign ended and you know i was really moved that he wanted to talk about the campaign what happened how it happened how you did it what was the reaction that you got what was effective and what wasnt effective you know what worked in advertising and in direct mail and i mean he was so interested in me that i was just transformed
1337425 ive always liked him but my gosh i felt so special
1337426 thats going to be up to the two nominees and i respect that because it is such a personal decision i think we will wait until they have an announcement

1337430 sales of flat panel display fpd inspection equipment were 29 8 million compared to 20 4 million in the first quarter of 2008 and 11 2 million in the second quarter of last year fpd remains strong although there is some anxiety in the market and short term fluctuationsin end user demand the fundamental trend is clearly up with strengthening demand for panels and continuing stabilization of panel prices our customers expansion plans remain on track we are raising our expectations for fpd revenues to approximately 110 million this year from our previous guidance of 100 million
1337431 we expect overall revenues in q3 to be similar to q2 for the full year we are leaving our guidance unchanged
1337432 the economic setting is very challenging the diversity and breadth of our product lines provides us some measure of protection but we must remain cautious and vigilent we have a long history of balancing the need to grow and develop with fiscal responsibility

1337445 in the fourth quarter we expect a 1 5 percent decline in real consumption holding gdp flat
1337446 the economy is likely to remain stagnant in the first quarter of 2009

1337448 when you look at real consumer spending net of medical care food and utilities what you see is that it contracted 0 3 percent at an annual rate in both the fourth quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2008
1337449 perhaps its when they try to take out a student loan or a home equity loan to pay for college
1337450 concerns about the consumer outlook will probably lead to further tightening in credit card and other household lending
1337451 discretionary cash flow for the household sector will actually shrink over the remainder of 2008 making an outright contraction in consumer spending likely
1337452 a whopping 2 4 percentage points of real gdp growth
1337453 although the weak dollar should continue to help u s exporters gain market share the risk that foreign demand weakness will wash back onto u s shores is clearly growing

1337640 the district court mistakenly limited its analysis primarily to the embodiment requirement
1337641 as a result of this error once it determined that the buffer data was clearly capable of being reproduced i e that the work was embodied in the buffer the district court concluded that the work was therefore fixed in the buffer and that a copy had thus been made

1337643 these facts strongly suggest that the works in this case are embodied in the buffer for only a transitory period thus failing the duration requirement
1337644 cablevision we note also has subscribers who use home vcrs or dvrs like tivo and has significant control over the content recorded by these customers but this control is limited to the channels of programming available to a customer and not to the programs themselves cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the video on demand context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing for these reasons we are not inclined to say that cablevision rather than the user does the copying produced by the rs dvr system as a result we find that the district court erred in concluding that cablevision rather than its rs dvr customers makes the copies carried out by the rs dvr system
1337645 cablevision argues that because each rs dvr transmission is made using a single unique copy of a work made by an individual subscriber one that can be decoded exclusively by that subscribers cable box only one subscriber is capable of receiving any given rs dvr transmission

1337672 the baggage fee was just a sneaky way to increase revenue rather than do it directly through a fare increase

1337675 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1337676 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes

1337680 how this lens is going to work in a childs eye we dont know weve never done studies
1337681 its an exciting thing in a patient who has had conventional therapy and failed
1337682 so it would imply that people who have a mutation in this gene and are susceptible to cancer have inherently regions of their dna which are duplicated or deleted and therefore are unstable
1337683 and that may have something to do with the mechanism by which they develop cancer
1337684 what is also striking is that with each successive generation the cancers tend to occur earlier in age and may also be more aggressive biologically
1337685 so rather than what we have to do now look for everything at every age which becomes an extreme burden on the patients and their families you may be able to say for such and such a person in the family we only need to focus on this tumour type starting from this age
1337686 hope for the future hope that in an lfs family that the legacy of loss will end
1337687 we know cancer to be basically a disease of genetic instability in the cancer cells and all weve done here is use an unusual model to show that that instability is actually present in every cell in every person
1337688 nem poderia dizer uma vez que o brasil signat rio de documentos da organiza o das na es unidas segundo os quais a tortura um crime comum e imprescrit vel

1337692 os perseguidores n o foram anistiados ali s nem reivindicavam isso a campanha pela anistia foi feita pelos familiares dos desaparecidos dos presos torturados uma fal cia dizer que a anistia tinha m o dupla uma farsa que no brasil querem transformar em verdade
1337693 muitos condenados pelo regime militar por esses crimes ficaram presos e s conseguiram sair quando suas penas foram atenuadas
1337694 ora se n o houve anistia para eles por que haveria para os torturadores os que torturaram e massacraram cidad os que eles deveriam proteger

1337712 egg and hog operations are the worst broiler chickens at least dont spend their eight week lives in cages too small to ever stretch a wing that fate is reserved for the american laying hen who passes her brief span piled together with a half dozen other hens in a wire cage whose floor a single page of this magazine could carpet every natural instinct of this animal is thwarted leading to a range of behavioral vices that can include cannibalizing her cagemates and rubbing her body against the wire mesh until it is featherless and bleeding pain suffering madness the operative suspension of disbelief depends on more neutral descriptors like vices and stress whatever you want to call whats going on in those cages the 10 percent or so of hens that cant bear it and simply die is built into the cost of production

1337745 wcf windows communication foundation is happening although it is happening very slowly because it is very large we have the basics in place but it
1337746 i am also trying to convince people that we need to redo certain desktop components using moonlight because we could get a flashier nicer user interface with the designers actually prototyping this interface in inkscape or blender
1337747 this is a new group inside of novell basically my team grew from about 30 to 40 people over the last year and a half most of the hires went to moonlight so now with 15 people working on moonlight the biggest part are new hires
1337748 slashdots standard nerd hypocrisy is another running gag everyone knows that anything related to apple linux open source is innovative and cool whereas if microsoft had done exactly the same thing it would be evil and monopolistic double standards rule
1337749 unfortunately one of the downsides of nerdy sites is that they attract loads of nerds these are the people who dont have girlfriends or proper jobs who live on pizza in their parents basement and rarely see the sun who have an encyclopedic knowledge of star wars but no common sense
1337750 i sort of expected a vendor representative to write and offer a unit but that did not happen this may tell more about the state of this market than anything else
1337751 that is false moonlight is usable for anyone on any distribution of linux redhat ubuntu etc it is not limited just to novell as mono is
1337752 there you have it from silverlights lead dev so clearly ms believes that only novell via the patent covenant can use mono so this clearly tells us that since moonlight depends on mono libs it is a potential patent trap

1337758 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay
1337759 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1337760 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1337761 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1337762 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1337763 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1337764 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1337765 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1337766 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself

1337770 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1337771 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1337772 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1337773 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1337774 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1337775 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1337776 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence

1337787 the bridge collapse should not have been unexpected the minnesota tragedy is part of a broader nationwide problem with structurally deficient bridges the span on i 35 had been classified as structurally deficient since 1990 meaning that significant load bearing elements were impaired although not necessarily in dangerous condition bridge inspectors have assigned this status to one in eight bridges across america totaling more than 70 000 with pennsylvania topping the list at 5 798 more than 50 000 bridges nationwide are sufficiently damaged that inspectors recommend they be replaced entirely the major reasons for this systematic failure are short sighted politics and misguided policies that cause funding for bridge repair to compete unsuccessfully against money for new highways

1337827 longstanding legal economic and societal manifestations of gender discrimination and inattention to their sexual health influence womens vulnerability to hiv considerably
1337828 in poorer countries of the world some mothers are still being infected through contaminated blood or medical equipment of the more than four million infants and children below 15 years infected with hiv since the pandemic over 90 percent acquired the virus through this route he explained
1337829 this situation poses difficulties since mothers of newborn babies who know they have hiv face difficult dilemma in choosing between breast feeding and bottle feeding however this context differs depending on the country and the womans own socio economic status

1337860 said patrick cote of the herzberg institute of astrophysics in victoria canada
1337861 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1337862 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1337863 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1337864 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1337865 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts

1337870 this will be the biggest olympics yet and the gb team goes into it better prepared than ever before
1337871 other countries and old rivals like australia now look to us as a country that got serious about sport and are now saying they are in danger of falling behind team gb in the medal table
1337872 we are about to enter a glorious new era for british sport and i hope success in beijing will inspire the next generation of young sports stars
1337873 that is a serious target we want it to be achieved its vital in the sense of the investment thats gone in

1337878 the best title plan of any company in the industry
1337879 frankly i think that a lot of the intellectual property we create are better than the licenses that doesnt mean there isnt room for great licenses theres room for both
1337880 i think what youre noticing is that in years gone by we havent had as many great original intellectual properties theres a lot more of that this year from ea and i think from here forward
1337881 i think what redeems our industry is quality and i think we take a step back every time we take a license and exploit it with a crappy game thats not what were about

1337884 the biggest one is the expectant father its a really good one
1337885 also ive watched look whos talking and look whos talking too id be worried if the baby sounded like bruce willis
1337886 the best advice my dad has given me was go with your gut and he said you cant really have expectations if i have expectations that hes going to be a rock star im sure hell come out being into sports and if i have expectations that hell be into sports then hell be into math or something
1337887 im just going into taking it one step at a time and im just excited to meet the baby
1337888 its not a secret but its more of a private thing i havent really figured it out yet so i dont want to go out there and say what it is and then have it not be that
1337889 contrary to the stories out there we dont know the sex of the baby
1337890 im a person that always likes to be surprised so i like to wait for the surprise
1337891 ashlees a trouper shes been really good with this shes probably one of the most health conscious spiritually free pregnant women ive even been around
1337892 could someone tell me please how much work has been done and how much money has been spent in iraq

1337894 there were lots of shots i heard 1 2 3 and 4 shots one after the other
1337895 they just need to stop youre only killing yourselves youre only killing your own
1337896 we have to stop it man enough is enough man innocent children are falling down
1337897 displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
1337898 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1337899 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1337900 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1337901 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1337902 fluffy is slowing down i just figured its because shes getting old
1337903 i could walk away from my sport tomorrow and feel very happy about my achievements but an olympic medal would make the finished product
1337904 i go into every race believing that i can win my list of achievements helps put other competitors off
1337905 i am very much a short course swimmer and the olympic games are long course
1337906 im very good at long course but my forte has always been short course
1337907 my father at the age of 11 got thrown in a lake petrified of water and unable to swim
1337908 he still cant to this day but was determined that my sister and i for safety reasons first and foremost would learn to swim
1337909 from an early age i just had to race people i had this competitive thing
1337910 whosoever acquires any influence here can obtain his share of legal plunder
1337911 in some respects the bush administration is simply following a familiar path by responding to real dangers with illegal and deplorable methods
1337912 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1337913 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1337914 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia
1337915 brenda wineapple brings a scholars diligence and a novelists imagination to her account of dickinson and higginsons relationship crafting a tour de force that should delight specialists and casual readers alike the books individual strands of inquiry higginsons life dickinsons poems the letters that passed between them and the historical political and artistic contexts of the age are interesting in and of themselves but when intertwined so as to inform and strengthen each other theyre fascinating
1337916 a good and happy child is so well done that part of me wishes i had missed it i like to sleep soundly at night
1337917 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1337918 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1337919 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1337920 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail
1337921 the process of government can be annoying in its obsessive repetition of its main theme in its lack of interest in empirical evidence and yet its one of those rare books which change the way you look at the world
1337922 it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years
1337923 it would be even harder to imagine a set of policies more likely to increase the dangers facing the united states and the world

1337928 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1337929 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1337930 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1337931 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1337932 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live

1337948 they work in close relation with the police the police do not allow any other rickshaws apart from the rentals owners to ply in that area if found any they will break the cycle and beat up the puller or we may call them slaves

1338005 paul wilde een nummer opnemen over hoe hij tegenover heather staat en over wat er gaande was met de paparazzi want niemand had eerder zijn kant van het verhaal gehoord dus dit wordt de eerste keer dat ieamand een nummer hoort over dat onderwerp het is een zeer emotionele en krachtige song
1338006 wat die song aantoont is dat paul niet verbitterd is tegenover heather maar dat hij medelijden heeft met haar hij vindt het jammer dat ze hem nooit alles over haar leven heeft kunnen vertellen hij vindt dat hun romance zo snel en zo publiek is gegaan dat er heel wat nooit is uitgesproken paul weet dat heather een complexe vrouw is en dat ze fout begrepen wordt maar dat heeft ze nog erger gemaakt door zaken uit haar verleden verborgen te houden

1338278 he knew how to bring together orchestra and singing doing everything possible to bring out the best singing performance
1338279 it is not by chance that he worked with callas when she had her small vocal problems
1338280 he was of the old school he knew the repertoire backwards

1338288 then the five of them sat around discussing how to change the town in any way they possibly could implying and even stating flatly that the local folks werent intelligent enough to effect change themselves one could reasonably infer that the citizens of vilcabamba were waiting patiently in their cribs until their five gringo leaders returned and told them what to do and breast fed them and rocked them to sleep

1338295 in the past few years many women who are well educated and trained for career tracks have decided instead to stay at home
1338296 it says we make enough money that we both dont need to work outside the home
1338297 and especially with the recent economic pressures a stay at home spouse is often an extreme and visible luxury
1338298 i go grocery shopping on wednesdays and clean house on thursdays
1338299 if you told me years ago that i was going to be a stay at home wife i would have laughed at you
1338300 i was able to clip coupons do all the chores and make nice dinners
1338301 i thought about the feminist movement all those women who worked so hard so that i could go out and have a good career and i was kind of saying no thanks
1338302 but i dont see what good it would do to work in a job that i couldnt stand and if i have the choice not to why wouldnt i take that opportunity
1338303 everyone seems to be ok with women staying home when they have kids
1338304 ive actually heard people say that women who dont work are a drain on society
1338305 many women i talk to take care of the household seriously and they want to focus on caring for the home whether or not it involves children
1338306 i hear frustration from men whose wives choose not to work
1338307 but only if there are financial stresses one of the realities is that few men appreciate the scope and difficulties of managing a household
1338308 when catherine stays at home i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden
1338309 she also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores garage sales and at grocery stores
1338310 i dont believe that the woman has to be the exclusive cook cleaner or shopper and i dont believe the man must be the breadwinner i wouldnt mind staying at home while catherine works
1338311 you are going to be working 16 18 hours a day and youre gonna be your weekends are gonna be filled with photo shoots youre not gonna even have time to go to the grocery store

1338395 and also i knew with individual congressional campaigns its hard to get national attention
1338396 i feel like the media and democrat party sic go out of their way to find the exception to the rule
1338397 they go out of their way to find the anti iraq war veteran and the great majority of us support the mission there and i thought who better to broadcast our support for the mission than guys who are going to congress

1338409 we talk to men about the things that are happening in their lives right now and we challenge them to do something about it
1338410 guys respond to a challenge the lord will help them but they have to admit that something is not right in their life
1338411 men dont think of the lord when things are rockin and rollin when things start turning bad thats when we need to be available to the men
1338412 right now obama should have a double digit lead over mccain given all the favorable attention that obama has received but he doesnt have a double digit lead mccain is in this race when people did not expect him to be in the race
1338413 so obama has not lived up to expectations mccain has exceeded expectations so if we put that into the calculus we have to say that mccain is in a reasonably good position to win the race

1338424 but republicans are working hard to make it seem like theyre fighting for cash strapped commuters and not the oil companies who wrote their plan
1338425 weve invited the media and having a good crowd is critical to show them that voters dont want oil industry gimmicks they want real solutions like alternative energy to solve our energy crisis

1338436 para m no hay ninguna chance de conseguir una medalla no lo digo para quitarme presi n sino lo que demuestra la realidad con la marca que me clasific para los juegos que es de 49s 04 100 no ingreso entre los mejores 24 tiempos si se mantiene el nivel que se viene dando en los ltimos ocho meses ser muy dif cil clasificar siquiera a una semifinal
1338437 los tiempos de ahora realmente sorprenden hay nadadores que hace dos o tres a os estaban a la par m a y hoy est n nadando un segundo y medio m s fuerte en este nivel es muy dif cil mejorar d cimas sin embargo ellos bajaron un segundo y medio eso te hace sospechar mucho
1338438 es cierto que muchos atletas provienen de pa ses productores de la nataci n que viven innovando y de los cuales estamos muy lejos lo que ellos consiguen quiz s nosotros comenzamos a copiarlo a os despu s pero tampoco creo que haya cambiado tanto la metodolog a y que estemos tan relegados en el tiempo en atenas con mi mejor marca hubiese sido sexto y hoy no s si entro en las semifinales
1338439 participar de una final ol mpica siempre fue un sue o latente algo que quise alcanzar m s all de haber conseguido logros importantes en mi carrera ese fue siempre un anhelo la realidad indica que ser muy dif cil de conseguir en beijing pero si no se d realmente estar muy tranquilo porque s que hice todo lo posible tuvimos una gran preparaci n y trabajamos muy seriamente en los meses previos
1338440 trato de no pensar que es mi ltimo juego intento que eso no me distraiga ni me vuelva loco la ansiedad ya me jug en contra en atenas donde estuve permanentemente pensando en la competencia antes de tiempo y eso no me hizo nada bien la clave es disfrutar compartir momentos con los chicos del equipo y tambi n con los de los dem s disciplinas obviamente con toda la responsabilidad que implica estar aqu en el evento m ximo al que puede aspirar un deportista
1338441 despu s de atenas hab a perdido las ganas las motivaciones hasta fines de 2005 me cost bastante recuperar el nivel pero despu s me di cuenta que todav a pod a seguir nadando volv a sentir confianza y fundamentalmente me di cuenta que esto me hac a feliz eso es fundamental practicar algo que te de placer
1338442 elegimos esa fecha porque hay otros nadadores que tambi n se van a retirar entonces acordamos hacer una especie de retiro todos juntos
1338443 seguramente ser un cambio muy brusco porque dejar lo que hice toda mi vida quiero volver a c rdoba donde est n mi familia y mis amigos all empezar con nuevos proyectos seguramente vinculados al deporte y por supuesto no descarto a la nataci n despu s de tantos a os en esta disciplina compartiendo momentos con grandes entrenadores y nadadores quiz s me ayuden a trasladar esa experiencia o a darles consejos a otros deportistas tal vez tambi n sirvan para mejorar la pol tica deportiva

1338465 but in hockenheim and budapest the feel of the car was much more in my direction and better suited my driving style
1338466 i could just put the car where i wanted to in a in a corner and that was the case in both qualifying and the race
1338467 although qualifying was good i felt i might even have been a couple of places further up the grid
1338468 i was second fastest to massas ferrari with low fuel in q2 but struggled a bit in q3 with tyre temperatures
1338469 i actually set my best time on used tyres because i couldnt get the tyres up to temperature for the first flying lap of my last run because robert kubica was a bit slower on the out lap compared to me and i had to slow down
1338470 i lost a bit of performance on the flying lap but in the end i was happy with fifth even though i thought i could have gone quicker than robert
1338471 ive had to improve my starts because my reaction times were not perfect at the first couple of races

1338473 unclean water and dysentery are the biggest issues in zabul
1338474 this project will help children under 5 years old who suffer from malnutrition and diarrhoea
1338475 the investigators are well aware that their work is not exempt from imperfections
1338476 they worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results especially with regards to the fate of the unfortunate child
1338477 this is not unfortunately a police story a crime fit for the investigative mind of a sherlock holmes or a hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice always restore order
1338478 he then realised the man was staring fixedly at the area in question very focused on what he was doing and did not notice flacks presence
1338479 he said he did not remember seeing the man there before or anywhere else in luz since madeleines disappearance
1338480 this material was never shown to kate gerry jane tanner or anyone else in the group
1338481 seeing it in the files in the last day or so is the first they have known about it again one has to ask what the police were doing by not making this material available at the time
1338482 no element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances of madeleines disappearance
1338483 it is obvious that neither of the defendants gerald or kate acted with intent
1338484 they could not predict that the resort where they had chosen to spend a few days holiday would leave the lives of any of their children in danger
1338485 it was located in a quiet place where the majority of residents are foreign citizens of the same nationality and without any known history of this type of crime
1338486 it seems obvious to us that the crimes of exposure or abandonment can be eliminated
1338487 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1338488 how to deploy and use these kinds of substances so you start to piece it all together
1338489 very quickly fort detrick md experts told us this was not something some guy in a cave could come up with
1338490 they couldnt go from box cutters one week to weapons grade anthrax the next
1338491 last night the hardest working man in rock n roll came to gillette stadium for
1338492 theres an old adage among diehard fans of bruce springsteen and the e street
1338493 sure at age 58 springsteen has slowed down but not as much as the rest of us he still races around and slides across the stage he pours his heart and soul into each performance as if hes trying to convince each ticket holder that this is an event that he is going to make you remember the rest of your life if you didnt like the last song well hes going to play the next one even harder in a time of mortgage foreclosures layoffs and 4 per gallon gas prices springsteen makes sure that each of the 60 000 plus fans in football stadiums is getting their moneys worth
1338494 we waited 100 years for this moment so we will sacrifice and endure any hardship
1338495 we are very excited for the olympics but we little guys are not going to get rich
1338496 tell the government that if they dont change the law we will not make any money
1338497 but because of these unfair regulations and treatments ive started losing my passion for the event and ive become more indifferent
1338498 does such an extravagant games necessarily demonstrate our countrys strength and prosperity
1338499 i think the so called century old dream isnt the peoples dream and the so called best olympics is nothing more than the most costly games
1338500 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
1338501 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
1338502 an attack on a police battalion in remote kashgar is not meant to inspire fear elsewhere
1338503 mgm is half of the las vegas strip so its hard to avoid
1338504 although the main vegas numbers were dreadful mgm is probably the barometer that everyone should be using
1338505 guests continued to visit the companys resorts in high numbers but at lower room rates and current economic conditions led to lower visitor spending
1338506 gaming revenues were impacted slightly more than non gaming revenues
1338507 unfortunately some statement was made in beijing which gave the impression that something new would happen in the area of gender verification at the beijing games
1338508 that is not the case the screening for female gender that was instituted in 1968 was done away with before the sydney games in 2000 for scientific and ethical reasons
1338509 if thats the case its impossible to imagine a male masquerading as a female if someones watching them urinate
1338510 suspicion was placed regarding the gender of some highly successful eastern european athletes
1338511 back in that era no one was paying much attention to and you have to wonder if they were ahead of their time
1338512 it was unfair not to allow them to compete particularly since theres no plausible reason to think they would have had an advantage
1338513 but i knew that i was a woman and that my genetic difference gave me no unfair physical advantage
1338514 our recommendation was that to begin with the clothing worn in athletic competition was such that itd be hard for a male to successfully masquerade
1338515 even assuming that was not true the requirement that the urine be passed under direct visualization for doping would detect any male imposter
1338516 an individual who is going through the torturous path of sex reversal or sex change is likely to take several years
1338517 its not likely theyre going to be at that optimal age level
1338518 we dont discriminate against size in womens basketball or womens volleyball
1338519 in terms of skeletal abnormality theres a fair amount of variation
1338520 my suspicion is that she has one of these rare disorders of sexual development
1338521 the way it was handled with all the publicity was totally inappropriate part of the rationale to come up with concrete procedures was to avoid this
1338522 there are people today who are hundreds of years old walking on the streets only you cant tell who they are
1338523 the majority of people can feel it elderly women will regain their menstrual period
1338524 falun is a miniature of the universe that possesses all of the universes capabilities it will forever rotate in your lower abdominal area once it is installed in your body year in and year out it will not stop
1338525 is not a downer but rather has an inspirational and uplifting message pausch weaved together the strands of his work and personal life in a very special way and there are lessons for everyone heres the video from last september
1338526 i cannot say and i will not say that he is dead he is just away with a cheery smile and a wave of the hand he has wandered into an unknown land and left us dreaming how very fair it needs must be since he lingers there and you o you who the wildest yearn for the old time step and the glad return think of him faring on as dear in the love of there as the love of here think of him as the same i say he is not dead he is just away
1338527 we need to have a new discussion about gender politics
1338528 its hard to be a grown man when there are so many people telling you what to do
1338529 we knew we shouldnt expect to see something like that
1338530 the really cool thing is that all the details are still there
1338531 the existence of wet based glaciers proglacial lakes tundra vegetation and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the western olympus range was warmer and wetter that that of today
1338532 as it cools it crosses thresholds this is one when antarctica became permanently frozen and locked up
1338533 because if human beings are unfortunate enough to push climate over one of these thresholds it could be a total catastrophe
1338534 i am a wine freak i love a good zinfandel and there is a small vintner named dover canyon that makes some of the best wine on the planet
1338535 these wines could convert zinfandel naysayers by demonstrating that high alcohol and fruit can be present but not overshadow the wines other charms most dishes on the table will benefit from its seamless style and red cherry acidity
1338536 this is an individualistic wine with something to say and most will find the conversation very pleasing
1338537 you can take some substantial pride in having one of the very few winery blogs crossing over into mainstream popularity
1338538 in particular would like to point out dover canyon winery as they have a great blog
1338539 im quite willing to wait a while for one of dover canyons stories
1338540 whether youre a two buck chuck fan or hopeless cork dork these feeds will help you keep up in between tastings
1338541 it the possibility of the reduction in lefts strength in the polls is a speculation but some seats may be reduced like we won in 19 seats out of 20 in kerala last time and this time there may be some shortage but we are working to increase the overall strength
1338542 bjp is trying to float the idea that indian polity is bipolar and either congress led upa or bjp led nda would come to power in the parliamentary polls we want to prove that the idea is wrong
1338543 when we are working for the third front how can i talk about any new political equation but if any equation arises then we will see
1338544 our own forward looking booking trends show improvement in the fourth quarter
1338545 the hard line confrontational policy the united states has embraced under the bush administration has inadvertently demonstrated the limits of u s power
1338546 the rejection of diplomacy has reduced the united states to a condition of self inflicted powerlessness regarding many problems
1338547 the vacuum is being filled in part by u s adversaries iran syria hamas and hizbollah and in part by friendly arab regimes which seek to find a way forward in situations where u s policy has contributed to stalemate
1338548 many essentially friendly countries are openly willing to pursue policies the united states disapproves of presenting washington with a fait accompli and the choice of either openly criticising the action of its so called allies or grudgingly tolerating it
1338549 t he united states has little leverage over the policies of even friendly countries
1338550 he knew how to bring together orchestra and singing doing everything possible to bring out the best singing performance
1338551 it is not by chance that he worked with callas when she had her small vocal problems
1338552 he was of the old school he knew the repertoire backwards
1338553 he could solve any problem because he knew the subject really well
1338554 adjust the sound the orchestra the timing the dynamics to the conditions of any given night this is something that old time directors could do really well
1338555 the deal we made for the cars is a full album game download and rock band is the only game title out there putting full albums up as downloadable content
1338556 having said this we would not license the full album out for a similar use
1338557 can and will when the opportunity presents itself license single tracks from this album for other games
1338558 this may be the cleanest town ive ever seen in latin america
1338559 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games

1338562 until now the only option for transplant patients has been to take a cocktail of drugs for the rest of their lives
1338563 these drugs can cause severe side effects and cannot always prevent the slow destructive process of chronic rejection which often leads to the failure of the transplanted organ
1338564 that is why our use of transplant acceptance inducing cells taics in kidney transplant patients is such an exciting development as it could eventually offer patients who have had transplant surgery a much higher quality of life free from complex drug regimes
1338565 although our use of taics is still in the preliminary stages the results of our clinical trials on 17 kidney transplant patients are promising
1338566 we concluded that although the stage one trial showed that taic therapy was both safe and clinically practicable the trial was unable to provide evidence that postoperative taic administration has a beneficial effect
1338567 although our stage two clinical trial did not provide conclusive evidence of a beneficial effect of pre operative taics treatment the results were encouraging
1338568 they suggest that taics promote a physical state that might allow us to minimise the drugs we use to stop the patients immune system from rejecting their new organ
1338569 our research clearly shows that infusing taics into patients before they have a kidney transplant or after the procedure has been carried out is a practical and safe clinical option
1338570 although this procedure is still being developed and refined it poses an exciting possibility for clinicians and patients alike
1338571 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1338572 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1338573 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1338574 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area
1338575 not be exploited to proselytize a particular religious tenet or belief or aggressively advocate a specific religious creed or derogate another religious faith or to disparage any other faith of belief
1338576 i dont mind losing the election but i do mind losing my faith or my belief in the constitution
1338577 paul has done a track about how he feels about heather and what was going on with the paparazzi because no one has heard his side of it at all so this will be the first time anyone hears a song relating to that subject its a very emotional and very powerful song
1338578 what the song shows is that rather than feeling embittered towards heather paul just feels sorry for her
1338579 he feels sorry that she was never able to tell him the full truth about her past life he feels that their romance happened so fast and so publicly that a lot never really got said
1338580 paul knows heather is a complex person and deeply misunderstood but that she has hardly helped herself by being less than transparent about her life
1338581 rebecca has been craving a lot of ice cream and not any one particular brand a lot of the different ones at ben and jerrys but also other crazy brands
1338582 thats all you can really do as the man go out and get food

1338594 we applied with the games organisers to order an extra long bed after the good luck beijing test events in april
1338595 back then all the clinical beds here were just 2 1 metres long and were very uncomfortable for the patients
1338596 of course we hope no one gets injured and all the athletes play well at the games
1338597 is growing at least twice as fast as the market and is gaining market share in its strategic growth regions
1338598 beiersdorf is not immune to the increasing prices in the global raw material market and will adjust its selling prices to take account of this development next year
1338599 no secret deal or accommodation kept us out of the city
1338600 as 90 percent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem
1338601 but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
1338602 there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in and start mentoring the iraqi troops
1338603 when the action was launched british forces provided a raft of military support including armor artillery airpower medical and logistic support
1338604 what happened in basra nasiriyah amarah and other areas falls on the shoulders of the british forces
1338605 basra is considered the economic capital of iraq but the british let the militias do what they wanted
1338606 apparently they were fighting in a tavern in the area on sunday and the fight continued at school the suspect ran away after stabbing the victim but he was later brought to the police station by his two brothers
1338607 chinezii sunt foarte buni iar echipa masculina nu cred ca are vreun adversar care sa ii puna probleme la feminin insa competitia cred ca va fi foarte stransa iar avantajul oferit de public ar putea sa fie decisiv
1338608 ar fi o greseala sa spunem ca ne aparam titlul olimpic da am castigat aurul la atena dar in 2004 era o alta echipa
1338609 at present we have a queue of foreign customers waiting for military products foremost air defense systems under earlier contracts
1338610 its a big challenge and a huge adventure stepping up to this level
1338611 playing alongside guys like aj venter and schalk brits has been a huge experience and they have made it so much easier for me to adapt and fit into the side
1338612 the whole thing felt surreal and i cant actually remember the act of scoring itself but it was a move we have worked on in training and it was planned not instinctive he said
1338613 it is really good to have them back but im really surprised that players of this calibre have been released in particular to have frans and ruan back playing provincial rugby is quite a surprise
1338614 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1338615 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence

1338628 its just a tough environment and they are in the next fiscal year going to feel the brunt in the recent run up in oil and commodity cost
1338629 the strength of the portfolio and our focus on innovation and productivity give us confidence that we will continue to deliver sustained growth in the coming year and beyond
1338630 and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1338631 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1338632 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1338633 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved

1338636 israel is a critical american ally and a beacon of democracy in the middle east not a constant sore as barack obama claims
1338637 we may be hard wired to treat fairness as a reward
1338638 receiving a fair offer activates the same brain circuitry as when we eat craved food win money or see a beautiful face
1338639 fairness is activating the same part of the brain that responds to food in rats
1338640 in both cases they were being offered the same amount of money but in one case its fair and in the other case its not
1338641 the brains reward regions were more active when people were given a 5 offer out of 10 than when they received a 5 offer out of 23
1338642 we call this finding the sunny side of fairness because it shows the rewarding experience of being treated fairly
1338643 were showing what happens in the brain when people swallow their pride
1338644 the region of the brain most associated with self control gets activated and the disgust related region shows less of a response
1338645 brain reacts to fairness as it does to money and chocolate
1338646 if we can regulate our sense of insult we can say yes to the insulting offer and accept the cash

1338654 we have a real challenge on our hands but its one that i will accept head on
1338655 we decided to go down this route mid way through last season toms ideal for the role
1338656 we have given him time to settle in at rodney parade and work with his team mates and he is fully aware of the responsibility that comes with this appointment
1338657 he has taken over from a quality leader in colin charvis and i fully expect both of them to use their experience to drive the squad forward in the foreseeable future
1338658 it is an honour to be given the responsibility of leading such a proud team and i acknowledge that
1338659 im looking forward to travelling to belfast with the squad this weekend and putting in some honest and hard work in preparation for a season which everyone round here has high expectations
1338660 rory has size pace and good handling skills and comes with good reports from a lot of knowledgeable aussies that ive talked to recently
1338661 we were made aware of the young his availability a month ago and it was a position in the squad that we felt needed bolstering
1338662 after a lot of research and homework on the junior waratah he was well worth giving the opportunity
1338663 i would say the varieties that are earlier such as chardonnay probably suffered a little bit more than something thats later like cabernet sauvignon
1338664 our yields will be down from last year but thats just because we had rough weather early in the spring and during the flowering period
1338665 she thought we were really over there for a good purpose and she loved the people and thought we were helping them that we were making a difference

1338690 with the new record which is called the anti mother and it comes out august 5 is we really didnt know what we were going to do when we started writing this record

1338948 i am very pleased that this mou addresses outstanding matters affecting joint venture business including government requirements from the mining review and that we can deal with everything in one merged joint venture agreement
1338949 the result would be that gold mining in south africa will decline slowly and gracefully over the next 40 years
1338950 the risk is that the countrys gold mining sector might expire simply because it costs too much to get the gold out and not because there is no longer any gold left to dig
1338951 the technical and financial problems of trying to extract gold from ever deeper levels were perhaps the main reasons for south african gold production to decline yet more over the years ahead

1339033 i asked him whether given how much money he made because of a vaccine he is the best person to advocate for vaccine even if we assume hes never done anything improper does he have the credibility to convince the public he says yes because he has the knowledge of how vaccines are tested and created because hes been behind the curtain at pharmaceutical companies things a strictly academic scientist wouldnt have access to he admits his vaccine made him wealthy but he says he spent 25 years trying to develop it because he wanted to save kids
1339034 asked whether any specific facts in the story were wrong he said it was primarily the tone he objected to

1339052 i realized a long time ago that there are two subjects in the world about which i know a great deal one is sailing and the other is cabbage varieties and about twenty years ago it occured to me that every time either sailing or cabbages were discussed in the mainstream press the writers got nearly everything wrong well after a while i started to wonder why i believed them about things i know about i mean what was the likelihood that they were conveying accurate well researched information on everything but boats and cabbage so thats when i stopped relying on journalists information as a basis for my business decisions and ive made a great deal of money ever since

1339059 my gut feeling forgive this personal comment i do not want my grandson to get a thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on
1339060 we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits this will be a resource to our very busy plaintiff attorneys in this country
1339061 given the sensitivity of the information we have been able to keep it out of the hands of lets say less responsible hands
1339062 perhaps this study should not have been done at all
1339063 will be taken by others and will be used in other ways beyond the control of this group
1339064 the lawsuits are of such magnitude that they could put vaccine producers out of business and limit our capacity to deal with a biological attack by terrorists
1339065 all reputable studies prove theres no link between vaccines and autism
1339066 autism rates have not gone down since all thimerosal was removed from all vaccines in 2001
1339067 the number of new cases of autism in california has fallen for the first time in more than 10 years in what may be a bellwether for autism rates nationwide according to new data compiled by the state department of developmental services
1339068 is to switch to dispensing the actual vaccines without adding preservatives
1339069 thimerosal used as a preservative in vaccines is directly related to the autism epidemic
1339070 this epidemic in all probability may have been prevented or curtailed had the fda not been asleep at the switch regarding a lack of safety data regarding injected thimerosal a known neurotoxin
1339071 parents get angry when they see the following numbers listed on the internet these numbers have been out there for everyone to read for years
1339072 our message to parents is that immunization is life saving
1339073 theres nothing changed this is proven to save lives and is an essential component of protection for children across america and around the world
1339074 let me be very clear that the government has made absolutely no statement indicating that vaccines are a cause of autism that is a complete mischaracterisation of the findings of the case and a complete mischaracterisation of any of the science that we have at our disposal today
1339075 i found myself nodding along as i read saying yes
1339076 one of the final paragraphs in the article is a statement which shouldnt be controversial
1339077 but when our community has said similar things weve been treated like we were primitives who wanted to take public health back to the nineteenth century
1339078 some vaccines such as those aimed at viral infections are designed to ramp up the immune system at warp speed
1339079 they are designed to mimic the infection so you can imagine getting nine at one time how sick you could be
1339080 that children who develop autism may have immune systems that are particularly slow to mature

1339101 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1339102 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1339103 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1339104 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1339105 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1339106 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1339107 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1339108 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1339109 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1339110 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1339111 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1339112 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1339113 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1339114 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1339115 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1339116 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1339117 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies

1339121 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1339122 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1339123 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1339124 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1339125 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1339126 that the roe v wade approach has so cheapened the value of human life that someone could think its not a moral issue to destroy embryos that have been created solely for the purpose of research
1339127 i was like five bucks so i was like okay
1339128 seek out supportive audiences speak in small forums where less is at state at a staff meeting or a pta meeting or take a dale carnegie course work with a coach just get up in front of people over and over again keep doing it
1339129 if i was really as big as a house i could lift you up
1339130 remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel for which i suffer trouble as an evildoer even to the point of chains but the word of god is not chained

1339150 m amp a activity for industrial products companies as measured by deals continues to be challenged by a relatively weak economic and financing environment though we note a continued interest in large deals as well as deals involving u s targets across most sectors
1339151 given the amount of significant deal announcements made early in the third quarter we expect that many companies are beginning to consider even larger m amp a moves that will impact total deal value for 2008 notwithstanding this interest in large deals and domestic targets we continue to expect well capitalized strategic investors to drive overall m amp a activity until improvements in the credit environment lead financial investors to regain their appetites for risk

1339157 this initiative will address misinformation about vaccines that causes confusion among parents and puts children at risk
1339158 i am afraid they the fda have a tremendous amount of pressure being brought to bear by the medical profession by the pediatricians by congress and by industry and so they are under pressure and someday they will have to live with the fact with what they said is wrong
1339159 i would say to you the fda is partly to blame for the mecuricals still being on the market all that length of time if they would have followed through with our 1982 report vaccines would have been freed of thimerosal and all this autism as they tell me would not have occurred but as it is it all occurred
1339160 if they had listened in 1982 my child wouldnt have autism
1339161 the cdc cannot afford to admit thimerosal is toxic because they have been promoting it for several years today they are in the process of getting vaccines all over the world to immunize 100 million children with vaccines many of which contain thimerosal
1339162 these people are being forced to say something sometimes they really dont believe but they are having to say it i am not sure i can live long enough to see a lot of that taken away from them i can only hope

1339167 it is important to note that the vast majority of vaccine injury awards in the vicp have been for children suffering dpt vaccine brain injuries and deaths of all the vaccines which have been routinely used by children in the past century the brain damaging effects of the pertussis whooping cough portion of dpt vaccine is among the most well documented in the scientific literature
1339168 any chemical product because it is a chemical substance does produce some side effects the current vaccine dtp as far as we are concerned is a very safe and efficacious vaccine
1339169 a little too cozy not for profits may have undisclosed funding ties to for profit drug companies
1339170 the public may be getting hoodwinked because they may think these nonprofits are independent
1339171 but how can they do it independently if they are paid by the drug companies
1339172 were becoming contaminated by people who didnt represent the public in any way they represented particular moneyed interests
1339173 its a fair question who represents patients and how they come to call themselves
1339174 although patients seldom know it many patient groups and drug companies maintain close multimillion dollar relationships while disclosing limited or no details about the ties

1339209 nato has seen the reports of the violent confrontations in the georgian region of south ossetia in the last few days which caused a significant number of casualties
1339210 we call on all parties to de escalate the tensions
1339211 not aware of any troop concentrations by georgia in or near south ossetia
1339212 we discovered new information that led us to revoke those visas prudentially
1339213 they gave us the visas on july 30 and two days later we were told the visas were not valid
1339214 it was a great shock we had hoped to complete our studies especially after we were granted the visas we were packing our bags
1339215 not aware of any troop concentrations by georgia in or near south ossetia
1339216 if events develop according to the worst case violence scenario russia will not allow itself to remain indifferent considering that russian citizens live in south ossetia particularly in the conflict zone
1339217 georgia believes peace talks are the only way to settle conflicts
1339218 nato has seen the reports of the violent confrontations in the georgian region of south ossetia in the last few days which caused a significant number of casualties
1339219 we call on all parties to de escalate the tensions
1339220 the russian federation represents one of the sides in the conflict and the russian peacekeepers deployed in the conflict zone in south ossetia in fact prop up the separatist regime
1339221 the russian federation is carrying out on georgian land an aggression and actions that violate georgias sovereignty
1339222 if events continue to develop in this way if the attitude is not changed this wont lead to anything good
1339223 i dont want to make any grim predictions but if such events are repeated the situation may spiral out of control and lead to sad consequences
1339224 religion is more important to them than their own life or peace for their mothers and so they set out to perform jihad
1339225 starting from last year east turkestan organizations have been persistently trying to launch activities targeting the olympic games
1339226 they want to use the simplest methods to turn 2008 into a year of mourning
1339227 we are scared that after this things may be even harder for uighurs
1339228 we urge international society to put pressure on china to freely let journalists report from kashgar and deal with the issue legally and not go after innocent uighurs
1339229 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uighurs

1339234 i have the advantage of not having to have a business plan about movies
1339235 i have the advantage of being able to come up with an idea and say this is a good idea and gosh this turned out so great why dont we move it over here and do this
1339236 people are still getting used to the idea now that film makers are doing animated movies for everybody
1339237 but were seeing a big breakthrough with wall e and kung fu panda two recent successful animated movies audiences at large are just going and adults are enjoying it kids are enjoying it and i think star wars has always been part of that
1339238 its hard to put it down its addictive obviously for the fans too but its worse for me than most people
1339239 this is the kind of thing where the studios say you cant do that it will destroy the franchise
1339240 the thing that makes them different from all the other bands out there is that they can play with anyone
1339241 when we first started there werent any bands that sounded like us because we were a bit different
1339242 theres millions of bands that can get into the top 10 now and at the time it was impossible to get into the top 10 so we wanted to lead the way again and not follow
1339243 it sounds like the suns shining its the afternoon and youre getting ready to go out disco dancing
1339244 we recorded it in london it was sunny and we wrote stuff extremely quickly hopefully it sounds like how it was made and it was supposed to sound quick and off the cuff and happy and upbeat and wide and weve travelled everywhere in the world as well you cant help but want to expand your sound
1339245 a lot more vocals more stacks of vocals and not just one direct voice
1339246 we wanted to be happy with what we were doing and not sound like theres a lot of radio 1 indie and it all sounds pretty similar
1339247 indie bands are big so a lot of record companies are pushing indie bands and going weve got one and they dress in vests
1339248 and we wanted to make something weird and fresh and radical that people would go yes i remember what its like to live again
1339249 like when popeye ate spinach were not going to point fingers or name names but weve noticed that other bands didnt seem to be enjoying themselves on their new records
1339250 he brought a lot of vibe and spirit and happiness and joviality
1339251 it didnt feel like work it felt like making music we were trying to impress him
1339252 everyone wants to be his friend its a bit like school you know at school there was a kid who was pretty cool good looking good at homework sold loads of records that kid
1339253 if mark had put loads of trumpets all over this record it would have been the worst thing
1339254 he tried right at the end no its a kaiser chiefs record its not a mark ronson record
1339255 the idea of doing something to sell a record apart from writing really good songs is a little bit weird i want people to remember the record as the one with the really good songs not the one that came in the inflatable packet with crisps

1339262 non criminal fugitive aliens an alternative to having us basically track them down arrest and remove them on the governments terms
1339263 this will allow them a little bit of control over the removal process that ultimately will come for each and every one of them
1339264 there is no incentive for people to do this if people want to leave the country they can leave
1339265 when i was composing the music for the award ceremony i was thinking what makes a champion
1339266 what i want is to bring back a medal a nice one i know there will be many fights and it will be tough but i also know i can do it all i want is to bring back a medal
1339267 i havent any doubt about his ability to become olympic champion
1339268 the strongest thing about him is his mind and he will do everything to be olympic champion theres no doubt about it though he still has progress to make
1339269 physically i still need to work to push my limits even further i know i can win but i also know i can lose in the first round
1339270 im pretty happy to have six world record holders in my team and its good for them to because it takes the pressure off individuals
1339271 this team is full of young people who have goals and aspirations to succeed weve had a great preparation and were confident of some good performances
1339272 sydney was tough athens was extremely tough and this will probably be harder again
1339273 but im prepared to go to the well one more time and dig as deep as i can
1339274 i have already got the icing and i have already got the base so a cherry would be just a nice bit on the top
1339275 it doesnt really matter if i dont have it the cake is still nice anyway
1339276 its not necessarily a rival from america we have to worry about
1339277 traditionally thats what the main rivalry has been but i dont think that will be the case this time i have a feeling a lot of the countries will step up and eat into that gold medal tally
1339278 the two groups include some of the most vulnerable women and children with urgent medical needs requiring immediate attention
1339279 we hope that all of the palestinians will be able to leave the harsh conditions of the camps sooner rather than later
1339280 im at base camp im truly happy to be here finally and to be alive

1339288 normally hed get right back up but he wasnt able to
1339289 hes working on moving it around right now so weve got the full gamut of the medical services working with him
1339290 my heart broke for him because i know what its like to have worked for years and years and have one minute put it all in jeopardy
1339291 i told him to relax and stay positive until we found out what was really wrong its tough on everyone but this is the olympics and you have to move ahead you cant let something like this shake you
1339292 as far as his ability to compete we wont make any decisions until the last possible moment
1339293 no one is panicking right now were pretty optimistic about whats going to happen and brandons ability to compete
1339294 five people one of whom was a fifteen year old boy were executed in an open field in tebriz iran disregarded the condition in islam which bans the execution of people before reaching adulthood when it came to the fifteen year old kurdish boy

1339311 weapons were similar to those captured by police from an east turkestan terror camp in january 2007
1339312 we urge international society to put pressure on china to freely let journalists report from kashgar and deal with the issue legally and not go after innocent uighurs
1339313 we cant rule out that this was the work of a few east turkestan supporters within the country who have links to external terrorist forces
1339314 east turkestan terrorist forces are the most direct and most real terror threat to the beijing olympic games
1339315 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uighurs

1339335 telah ditemukan paspor pakistan dalam sisa sisa titanic jelas bahwa pakistan harus membayar aksi teror tersebut dan kita telah mengirimkan lebih banyak lagi tentara ke perbatasan
1339336 kapal itu sebelumnya milik keluarga thaksin shinawatra yang kemudian dijual ke perusahaan singapore kita akan mengambil kembali kapal itu untuk rakyat thailand
1339337 titanic adalah lambang kapitalisme tenggelamnya titanic memperlihatkan kepada dunia bahwa kapitalisme mulai hancur dan tenggelam cuba akan terus setia kepada cita cita sosialisme dan akan berjaya bersamanya
1339338 titanic apaan sih itu oh ya titanic kita sedang mengajukan ruu tentang pemberantasan titanic untuk itu kami akan mengadakan studi banding ke hawaii mohon masyarakat dapat memahami pentingnya ruu ini sehingga pembahasannya memerlukan konsentrasi yang tinggi untuk itu kami akan membahasnya di bali agar kami dapat bekerja lebih baik kami akan membawa serta istri istri anak cucu mertua keponakan mantu dll dll tentu dengan biaya negara harap maklum gaji kami sebagai anggota dpr hanya 30 juta kami meminta pemerintah untuk menaikkan tunjangan rapat 400 atau kami akan mengajukan interpelasi masalah titanic

1339340 jika mental dari para remaja kita di daerah belum siap terhadap pengaruhnya tidak hanya rentan terhadap konflik tetapi juga mereka akan salah dalam pergaulan dan bersikap kehilangan identitas pribadi dan sulit menyesuaikan dengan komunitas di tempatnya
1339341 padahal pengertian modern itu kan lebih ke cara berpikir remaja itu sendiri
1339342 mula mula yang diubah dari remaja remaja di daerah itu adalah penampilan seperti pakaian model rambut konsumsi makanan dan kendaraan

1339350 kami para nabi diperintah untuk berkata kepada manusia menyebarkan ajaran nya sesuai dengan tingkatan kemampuan berpikirnya
1339351 tidaklah orang orang kafir itu datang kepadamu membawa sesuatu yang ganjil melainkan kami datangkan kepadamu suatu yang benar dan yang paling baik penjelasannya
1339352 yusuf berkata tidak disampaikan kepada kamu berdua makanan yang diberikan kepadamu melainkan aku telah dapat menerangkan takwilnya jenis makanan itu sebelum itu sampai kepadamu
1339353 aku akan memberitahumu takwil tujuan perbuatan yang kamu tidak dapat bersabar terhadapnya
1339354 di sisi lain kelemahan yang terlihat dalam kitab kitab tafsir yang mengandalkan metode ini adalah a terjerumusnya sang mufasir dalam uraian kebahasaan dan kesusasteraan yang bertele tele sehingga pesan pokok al quran menjadi kabur dicelah uraian itu b seringkah konteks turunnya ayat uraian asbab al nuzul atau sisi kronologis turunnya ayat ayat hukum yang dipahami dari uraian nasikh mansukh hampir dapat dikatakan terabaikan sama sekali sehingga ayat ayat tersebut bagaikan turun bukan dalam satu masa atau berada di tengah tengah masyarakat tanpa budaya bahwa mereka mengandalkan bahasa serta menguraikan ketelitiannya adalah wajar karena di samping penguasaan dan rasa bahasa mereka masih baik juga karena mereka ingin membuktikan kemukjizatan al quran dari segi bahasanya namun menerapkan metode ini serta membuktikan kemukjizatan itu untuk masa kini agaknya sangat sulit karena jangankan kita di indonesia ini orang orang arab sendiri sudah kehilangan kemampuan dan rasa bahasa itu

1339360 we didnt hire mark ronson for him to make us sound like a version we hired him for 45 a day
1339361 on the seventh day god rested and as he did he became famished for some crunchy slightly greasy fried chicken with a side order of potato wedges then realized he had mandated that all ukrops stores stay closed on sundays so he decided to continue sleeping
1339362 it could very well mean the company may have been established within the first six days of earths existence
1339363 and the lord said pass me thy white chicken salad which doesnt necessarily represent me nor should you eat in remebrance of me though i must say this stuff is absolutely delightful for picnics and well known biblical dinners such as this one
1339364 it appears from these new verses that since the lord was a dedicated ukrops shopper and hated going to kroger he was unable to purchase alcohol and instead chose the grocers sweet tea
1339365 and it wasnt just any regular old bread he broke no no ukrops white house rolls of course

1339376 i have no time to answer you deivadus we are running out of time and my make up is melting
1339377 but we have to enter ylrevehc before sundown yotch might be in his lair
1339378 hmm er i dont know oh wait yes i remember hmm the the cadet from the intelligence department told me that yotch and that traitor are in that building
1339379 but why didnt you let us know youre not alone in this mission we are a team we are here to help you
1339380 thanks lets stop this drama weve got some fighting to do

1339385 by the time i entered that ionized gas where the electrons in the atom are separated from the nucleus usually considered to be the fourth distinct state of matter i was in shock to find myself spinning 133 north of south with an initial velocity of 42 miles per second therefore the force exerted by my circulating blood on the walls of my blood vessels which constitutes one of my principal vital signs are quite malfunctioning which felt like the great revolt which was the first of three major rebellions by the jews of iudaea province against the roman empire the second was the kitos war in 115 117 ce the third was bar kokhbas revolt 132 135 ce it began in the year 66 stemming from greek and jewish religious tension which means where am i

1339395 we report the discovery of a short orf embedded within the p3 cistron of the polyprotein but translated in the 2 reading frame
1339396 tests show that from an alignment with just 20 mutations mlogd can discriminate non overlapping cdss from non coding orfs with a typical accuracy of up to 98 and can detect cdss overlapping known cdss with a typical accuracy of 90 in addition the software produces a variety of statistics and graphics useful for analysing an input multiple sequence alignment
1339397 some of our oxygen is produced by viruses infecting micro organisms in the oceans
1339398 in major parts of the oceans the micro organisms responsible for providing oxygen and locking away carbon dioxide are actually single celled bacteria called cyanobacteria
1339399 these organisms which are so important for making our planet inhabitable are attacked and infected by a range of different types of viruses
1339400 it is beginning to become to clear to us that at least a proportion of the oxygen we breathe is a by product of the bacteria suffering from a virus infection
1339401 instead of being viewed solely as evolutionary bad guys causing diseases viruses appear to be of central importance in the planetary process in fact they may be essential to our survival
1339402 of a paediatric hiv infected cohort by a series of progressively longer treatment interruptions or drug holidays
1339403 increased hiv specific immune responses and decreased hiv rna were seen in those children who have had gt 10 cycles of antiretroviral discontinuations of increasing durations acting as autologous virus vaccinations other studies may have failed due to an insufficient number of exposures to hiv most of the studies had fewer than six drug interruptions
1339404 this technology should provide a new tool for the treatment of many diseases
1339405 even if you are working with a virus that is unknown or poorly characterized it is still possible to modify or paint it this is very interesting for emerging diseases
1339406 biology and art converge daily people paint their nails color their hair and tattoo their skin
1339407 now this convergence has entered a new dimension as painted viruses permit scientists to track cure and prevent disease
1339408 the first orders for prepandrix were placed last year by finland and switzerland before it had been approved by the european commission in 2007 sales for prepandrix totalled us 284 million worldwide
1339409 you people in the developing countries will be on your own if the pandemic comes
1339410 the use of viruses and viral gene transfer to explore the complexity arising from the vast array of new targets available from the human and murine genomes
1339411 the use of genomic and proteomic technologies to study virus host interactions and the varied strategies used by viruses to evade cellular defense mechanisms we study a wide range of viral pathogens including hepatitis c influenza ebola west nile sars associated coronavirus herpes simplex virus and human and simian immunodeficiency viruses
1339412 the interaction of viral genomes with their environments by sequencing several temperate pseudotemperate marine phage genomes
1339413 there is increasing evidence from functional genomics experiments that the patterns of cellular response to a variety of viral infections may reflect the pathogenic properties of the viruses we contend that dissection of the critical and often subtly different cellular pathways will eventually unveil opportunities for manipulating the host immune response to fight off viral infection control pathogenesis or both
1339414 innovations in sequencing technologies particularly the rapid high throughput pyrosequencing platforms continue to transform large scale biology the fields of viral metagenomics and viral diagnostics are therefore poised for rapid expansion
1339415 viral replication and target sequence expression from the tmv cp subgenomic mrna promoter
1339416 these lickm fusion proteins alone are able to activate both innate and adaptive antigen specific immune responses
1339417 recombinant antigens were enriched by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by immobilised metal affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography with dialysis after each step to at least 80 purity
1339418 we augment the protective capacity of a capsid deleted flavivirus dna vaccine by co expressing the capsid protein from a separate promoter in transfected cells the capsid deleted rna transcript is replicated and translated to produce secreted virus like particles lacking the nucleocapsid this rna is also packaged with the help of co expressed capsid protein to form secreted single round infectious particles srips that deliver the rna into neighboring cells in srip infected cells the rna is replicated again and produces additional virus like particles but in the absence of capsid rna no srips are formed and no further spread occurs compared with an otherwise identical construct that does not encode capsid our vaccine offers better protection to mice after lethal west nile virus infection it also elicits virus neutralizing antibodies in horses this approach may enable vaccination against pathogenic flaviviruses other than west nile virus
1339419 that the h5n1 strain of bird flu has not yet caused a pandemic is no cause for complacency preparations for the inevitable must be redoubled to mitigate the potential devastation
1339420 five years after the deadly h5n1 avian influenza virus exploded into a global epidemic in birds it has infected more than 300 people happily it has not yet evolved into a strain that can transmit easily between humans an event that would trigger a pandemic that could kill tens of millions but as long as h5n1 continues to be present in animals that risk persists and with so many other flu strains out in the world all constantly evolving a flu pandemic is inevitable
1339421 improved control measures especially for h5n1 itself and public health infrastructure are our frontline defences against a pandemic unfortunately the overall control picture is bleak thailand vietnam and china have notched up successes in curbing outbreaks in birds which is key to minimizing the chance that the virus can pass to humans but south korea had its worst outbreak ever in april and the disease has become endemic in indonesia bangladesh vietnam and egypt eradication now seems impossible and the task of containing the virus has become chronic and costly
1339422 in the next 18 months we bill amp melinda gates foundation the pasteur institute and the wellcome trust will develop maintain and disseminate a central inventory of funded research activities that are relevant to human influenza to ensure that stakeholders are well informed we will also coordinate roadmapping exercises to identify knowledge gaps these will assist funders and researchers in establishing research funding priorities with specific focus on vaccines drug therapies and epidemiology population science for example diagnostics surveillance transmission and modelling the bill amp melinda gates foundation and the wellcome trust will collaborate to fund these activities
1339423 the who met on 11 13 february this year to decide on the strains to be included in the vaccine for the 2008 09 season as usual the meeting was closed to all but invited participants who this year included members of the who influenza surveillance network representatives of national drug regulatory agencies and influenza vaccine manufacturers the experts involved chose to replace the h3n2 strain with a more recent isolate from 2007 which should be a better match to the circulating viruses next season neither the who nor the cdc publishes the evidence used to support their decision my emphasis that evidence includes hemagglutinin inhibition tests of hundreds of isolates genome sequences of some isolates and data on the ease with which the isolates can be grown in eggs
1339424 the process of choosing flu vaccine strains needs to be much more open other scientists such as those in evolutionary biology with expertise in sequence analysis could meaningfully contribute to the selection at present external scientists cannot review the data that went into the decision nor can they suggest other types of data that might improve it
1339425 the leaders of the influenza community especially the who and the cdc should create policies for sharing data and isolates that are more open and should insist that their own scientists follow those policies when these leading organizations set an example the rest of the community will follow
1339426 of course preparing vaccine in cell culture could reduce some of the pressures put on that dark room of vaccine predictors

1339450 johan yang bilang berkas pensiun dini di meja ibu baca pimpinan tertinggi masih setumpuk
1339451 memangnya pak johan yakin yang dilihatnya adalah berkas pensiun dini setahu saya saat ia dipanggil menghadap ibu di meja ibu memang banyak sekali tumpukan berkas tapi itu bukan berkas karyawan itu tumpukan map bilyet giro dan cek yang belum sempat ia tanda tangani
1339452 pak johan kelihatannya tegar dan cukup happy dengan keputusan itu
1339453 ya mau bagaimana lagi memangnya ada pilihan lain yang lebih baik daripada ia bernasib seperti putu
1339454 putu itu melakukan kesalahan pak makanya nasibnya seperti itu tapi saya rasa kita tak perlu khawatir selama kita bekerja dengan baik dan benar
1339455 ini bukan hanya perkara bekerja dengan baik dan benar di kantor teman teman banyak yang gelisah isunya mulai macam macam apalagi karyawan karyawan lama yang bolak balik kinerjanya cuma dinilai cukup
1339456 sudahlah pak jika pun itu memang benar nggak ada salahnya dicoba dihadapi dengan ikhlas bagaimana pun cepat atau lambat saat itu akan tiba apa pun alasannya ada saatnya kan kita harus berhenti bekerja mana tau giliran saya malah minggu depan
1339457 i still dont know how it will play out with this one
1339458 they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how the strong the movie will be
1339459 ive seen very little footage so i dont really have a feel for it i hope they do well and i hope it is a huge hit i do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen that is what james cameron created

1339463 dagli atleti azzurri serve un gesto forte e in questo senso anche disertare linaugurazione sarebbe un segnale importante da dare
1339464 certamente appoggio al pari di tutto il mondo civile la richiesta alla cina di una politica che sia garante dei diritti umani in modo molto molto maggiore rispetto a quello che accaduto fino ad oggi
1339465 considero le olimpiadi ha aggiunto fini comunque una festa di fratellanza tra i popoli e lesperienza dimostra che ogni qualvolta si dato corso al boicotaggio dei giochi olimpici non si raggiunto lobiettivo che ci si prefiggeva
1339466 non credo che i nostri atleti ha aggiunto fini abbiano necessit di inviti particolari perch sanno perfettamente qual il dovere morale cui adempiono nel momento in cui gareggiano e credo che non mancher loro la possibilit nelle modalit che riterranno pi opportune per esprimere piena adesione alla necessit di un rispetto autentico dei diritti delle persone
1339467 il gesto di imke duplitzer sia da stimolo per tutti gli atleti compresi quelli italiani
1339468 gesto simbolico che dovrebbe invitare tutti a riflettere su quei principi fondamentali pace libert e democrazia che non possono essere messi in secondo piano

1339471 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1339472 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1339473 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too
1339474 these can come out just as easy as they went in
1339475 with the obliteration of the centre of the jenin refugee camp the israeli military realized that it had to push its engineering corps to improve its art of destruction
1339476 hmm im thinking that we would go out and stargaze
1339477 sure yagkalaius and i stargazed last night and it was really fun
1339478 nope i dont feel pain its the unique ability of the satrunians
1339479 but we can feel love and i think its what im feeling right now
1339480 it was great i lived a happy life i wake up do 5000 push ups go to work kick some criminal butt get paid go back home and sleep
1339481 i miss my mum and dad can you go with me to capt nikolaus office i want to send them a message
1339482 hmm lets just act as if we dont know anything its for our safety
1339483 she was so strong the whole building collapsed after she did it
1339484 but how did she do it you said she was a beginner
1339485 yeah i asked her but she said she doesnt know how she did it shes a threat to my plans

1339495 si me la hubieran dado no lo hubiera dado a conocer a los medios hubiera tratado de que esto quedara dentro de la escuela y que se hiciera algo

1339497 the underground store is marked by a 32 foot street level glass cube
1339498 to have a tax cap makes no sense because right now we get to vote on the school budget
1339499 its the only governmental budget the public votes on every year and they can either approve or disapprove it
1339500 there is no question about the fact that funding education on property taxes on the local level can really hurt some people such as people on fixed incomes
1339501 thats why i think betty littles proposal of a tax circuit breaker makes a lot of sense there are some folks who vote yes who want schools to get what they need but it may negatively impact them and that is where a circuit breaker would work
1339502 it is just a case of government stepping in and trying to tell the local people what they can and cant do with their schools
1339503 the article in computerworld did not accurately reflect the discussion i agreed with ken on many thing sand he agreed with the potential of saas especially in the smb space
1339504 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1339505 when is the appropriate time to wear a fur stole
1339506 he also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion

1339510 are you thinking that captain nikolaus is talking to a bad guy
1339511 of course the captain is talking to a bad person you saw them talk didnt you
1339512 hmm lets just stop thinking about the captain so why did you go out of bed
1339513 i cant sleep too hmm come on lets get out and look at the stars
1339514 i miss my mum and dad but i think theyre angry with me coz i ran from the castle
1339515 dont worry theyll be proud of you when they hear that you are an iuus warrior
1339516 calling mischievous ones report to the conference hall immediately captain nikolaus is waiting for you
1339517 the iuus intelligence department have received valuable information that would help us defeat yotch
1339518 i cannot tell you that information as of now however i have something else to tell you you would be having your first mission
1339519 the castle of yotch at ylrevech is protected by three gates nobody can enter the gates except for yotch himself
1339520 but there is a chance that we could pass through those gates captain nognabilak oyaakdujan my predecessor had made three keys that can open the three gates he hid the keys himself for safekeeping but when he was dying he gave the keys to his best friends they are the guardians of the keys
1339521 we have to find them and get the keys first before yotch does
1339522 so do you know where these guardians can be found
1339523 yes my sources tell me that the first guardian can be found at an abandoned building 2 kilometers from erutcurtsatad city i will gather first all our weapons and we can go to our mission
1339524 last night i saw the captain talking to a gnidakihc capt nikolaus said that he accepted the gnidakihcs invitation but we have no idea what it is
1339525 hmm i was with princess prudence last night we cant sleep so we just strolled around the place
1339526 yes hes right well back to the captain lupeolo and i also saw him talking about the same thing on the day we got here right lupeolo
1339527 yeah the captain is about to do something and is just waiting for the right time
1339528 what do you guys think hes doing i think he is deceiving the gnidakihc guy so he would know what yotchs weaknesses are
1339529 dont you get it he has made us enter those portals because he was sure that all who would arrive would be the weak ones do you think that it was a mistake to put up a portal at pluto when he knew that there is nobody there except for lupeolo
1339530 but why did yagkalaius and deivadus entered the portal theyre not weak
1339531 duh he just let yagkalaius and deivadus enter the portal so that people wont suspect a thing if all of the warriors would be frail everyone would think that something unusual is happening
1339532 haha you cant reach the guardian alive over my dead wide forehead
1339533 be afraid i am yotchs soldier i am a gnidakihc hahaha
1339534 ouch i think my pelvic area is dislocated due to the force of the impact with a speed of 54 miles per hour
1339535 weve done it so hmm can you go out with me later this evening
1339536 i think ive seen that move before hmm i forgot the title of the movie
1339537 hey cant you do that later we are looking for a gnidakihc
1339538 you cant stop my happiness coz i like the way i am and you just cant stop my tingaling when i see a make up kit
1339539 hmm no i dont know how it happened but it just did
1339540 captain here is the key let us get out of here before this building collapses ohh
1339541 this is really obvious stuff in my opinion our industry is littered with many people who do not have a proper education in it let alone being trained in managing projects properly many of these people are put in charge of making decisions or signing off decisions around projects and typically end up making ignorant simplistic decisions often many of the stakeholders of projects can be like this and the failure is in getting them to realise the implications of a situation that creates many of the problems discussed in this article ask a surgeon does he she do half an eye operation because it costs less does a civil engineer design half a bridge because of a deadline constraint a big part of this is immaturity in our industry and not following many of the standards set in other professions such as engineering law and medicine its all basic planning techniques and basic acknowledgement of the complexity of a problem and it often stems from people who simply did not know what they are doing and would never admit it

1339544 a key addition to techrepublic is the use of tags to categorize all content on the site
1339545 we are extremely concerned with the interference with the search process because what it does essentially impugns the integrity and autonomy of the university
1339546 one outcome could be that we would impose censure on memorial which would have a devastating effect on their ability to attract not only a president but faculty
1339547 it would be an advisory not to take a job there that the threat to academic freedom was severe
1339548 we would have to investigate and look at all the facts and i dont want to prejudge it
1339549 we would hope it wouldnt come to a censure but interference by politicians at a university is a very serious matter
1339550 it will hinder the search for a president and i think any person who now puts themselves forward would have the fear of being seen as the for the government and i dont know of any credible person outside of some political hack who would want to put themselves forward
1339551 perhaps the last time that theres been this direct interference you would probably have to go back in western society to the middle ages when the churches were very much involved in the administering of universities and making sure that the people appointed to posts there had solid religious credentials rather than academic credentials
1339552 plot the locations of everything from local fuel supplies to the newest earthquakes worldwide
1339553 you can now layer information from multiple sources on the same map as well as save content thats relevant to you into a personal map

1339571 dramatic misapplication of the cfaa with far ranging consequences for american computer users
1339572 but under the governments theory the millions of people who disregard or dont read the terms of service on every website they visit could face computer crime charges
1339573 dangerously overbroad construction of the cfaa would criminalize the everyday conduct of millions of internet users
1339574 it is the view of the association that members need not honour do not call requests that originate from the organization in question
1339575 all telemarketers to maintain internal do not call lists and to abide by consumers requests not be called
1339576 there is no prohibition on consumers making such a request through a third party
1339577 a consumer can make a do not call request to an organization even though the consumer does not have an existing business relationship with that organization
1339578 to the extent that these requests are sent to organizations that engage in telemarketing and that are therefore subject to the rules regarding do not call lists these requests would be in compliance with the act and the current unsolicited telecommunications rules as outlined above in short on the basis of the facts as i understand them and have stated above i consider that do not call requests made through ioptout are valid and should be honoured

1339729 but recently in politics for russia its not clear what he has done

1339838 power efficiency is a top concern for every new it installation
1339839 with the amount of hype in the market about power savings it is refreshing to see an approach that out and out eliminates equipment these are savings that are easily understood by every participant in the it purchase cycle and in operations
1339840 pivot3 has taken advantage of the openness and high performance of the xen hypervisor to deliver a powerful new architecture for storage subsystems
1339841 xen virtualization is rapidly becoming embedded in all components of enterprise it architectures from servers to storage and network appliances
1339842 this technology offers hard savings to customers with large scale storage and server environments
1339843 in our current video surveillance market a typical customer with 500 cameras will realize real savings of 44 percent in power and cooling costs 51 percent in rack space usage and 22 percent in cost savings by eliminating 15 physical servers and five physical external failover storage chassis

1339847 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
1339848 now that customers and partners can download the vmware esxi hypervisor free of charge we expect virtualization to become even more pervasive increasing the demand for system builder offerings

1339854 symantecs strategy is to help enable a truly dynamic endpoint where applications and information are delivered to any computing environment in a seamless manner it organizations should have the confidence to leverage the full power of traditional and virtual computing environments to maximize resources and reduce complexity
1339855 as organizations increasingly leverage virtualization to deliver applications to endpoint devices simplified complete management of the virtualization stack and the security of the endpoint solution are both paramount concerns
1339856 virtualization is redefining traditional application delivery methods and solutions that leverage virtualization to securely deliver applications to a myriad of virtual and physical endpoints are best positioned for long term success

1339917 this may be the single most important fact about the last general election labour won another national majority of seats and indeed they won a large majority of english seats but the tories gained marginally more popular votes than labour in england the full result was startling in may 2005 labour won 286 out of 529 english seats with 8 05m votes or 35 5 of the popular vote tories 194 seats with 8 10m votes or 35 7 liberal democrats 47 seats with 5 201m or 22 9 and so that result in 2005 was obviously and indefensibly distorted labour winning 54 of seats with 35 of the votes

1339922 you don t mean a thing if your seat s not a swing
1339923 our withering democracy really is part of the problem it is said that in glasgow east labour hadnt canvassed voters for years taking this safe seat for granted this is what parties do in safe seats only exceptional mps prioritise campaigning in safe seats because there are so many other things to do we have a system that forces parties to focus their efforts on 50 100 seats we have a system that tells people theres no point in voting if you dont live in one of those seats a system that contributes to young people feeling they have no influence over the society to which they are subject
