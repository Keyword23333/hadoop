593228 he put the community on a firm financial footing once again he encouraged a minyan male quorum to come from israel to celebrate the high holidays so that the community could affirm and be proud of its identity he was able to protect the community archives from spiteful depredations as well as the dignity of the ark and torah scrolls from rough handling by the official inspectors on their frequent visits the gates of the synagogue were always open he ensured free access to the cemeteries he supported the ill and the needy it was a privilege to have known such a determined individual in spite of his advanced years and we salute him

593237 the green delegate challenge is a critical part of that effort
593238 weve been credited in a number of studies for being transparent with everything except for financials
593239 we typically bid against many of our competitors so disclosing our financials doesnt make sense
593240 these are folks who would not risk their reputations by working with any carbon offset provider that wasnt the best in class
593241 because they would be under the microscope and thats why were working with the dnc

593277 but we must learn to let go to relax completely before each period of in tense concentration here is the working principle relaxation precedes perfect concentration a delightful illustration of this point is given by elizabeth towne six puppies were playing in the barn the barn door was closed and with the world shut out they were giving themselves up completely to the spirit of play two of them were staging a mock battle over a feather while the others were rolling over and over in the loose straw on the barn floor in utter enjoyment suddenly the barn door softly creaked instantly every puppy came to attention heads up tails up bodies rigid bright eyes fixed in intense concentration on that door as it slowly swung open a moment before they had been in a state of complete relaxation now they offered a perfect example of concentration as they stood at attention waiting and watching for the unknown danger that might be coming from the other side of the barn door all great mental achievement has been preceded by periods of absolute rest or relaxtion during this time fatigue disappears the nervous forces recuperate and the minds stores up fresh energy axed establishes a reserve to draw upon during

593290 all the talk is over beckys playing for russia right now and were taking care of our business
593291 i think a lot of it has been the media in the states making it a lot bigger than it is
593292 you know were not really worried about her were worried about russia as a whole if anything its one less player we have to study a lot because we know her game so well playing against her we respect her and her game
593293 i dont think the becky thing is going to be an issue unless it comes down to the medal round during this tournament it doesnt have any kind of hutzpah when it comes down to crunch time if it comes down to winning a gold or silver thats when there will be a little more to it

593297 suddenly there is a lot of talk about cooperation and even merger between umno and pas friendly and unfamiliar sounds are being heard from all sides
593298 making more revelations in the case of the sodomy allegations against anwar ibrahim
593299 and why does abdullah want so much for the police to charge anwar simple because his deputy najib tun razak would invariably get dragged into this whole mess
593300 i wonder whether it is a sudden concern about the need for malay unity or it is the realisation that both pas and umno have become very weak true pas has won more seats in parliament than it had ever done before it has even won control over the state of kedah but pas is the weakest party in the opposition coalition or pakatan rakyat this cannot be what pas aimed for when it decided to soft pedal its islamic state ambition in order to work with dap and pkr
593301 but his coalition partners may not take kindly to this plan mca gerakan and mic are not likely to welcome this move neither would sabah umno members and the other coalition partners in sabah and sarawak the bn government with pas as a member would therefore be very shaky umno itself would be very shaky as not every umno member would relish the idea of nice positions being given to their erstwhile rivals
593302 such a coalition may give bn the two third majority but it is not likely to please the elctorate the malay voters may or may not welcome this unity bid but their concern is with the leadership of dato seri abdullah they want him out participation by pas in a bn still lead by dato seri abdullah will not mean things would be any better
593303 by associating with dato seri abdullah accepting the sweets and soft pedaling pas islamic state raison detre pas is likely to lose support
593304 the solution to the present malay feeling of insecurity is not a merger or some kind of co operation between the malay political parties it lies in restoring umno to its previous strength and this cannot be done for as long as dato seri abdullah is there there are several leaders in umno who are qualified to take over from him leaders who are not influenced by the greed of their families leaders who are willing to make sacrifices in order to restore pre eminent position of umno within the bn one of them could be rais yatim maybe in the end it would be tengku razaleigh hamzah with rais as deputy
593305 would anyone in his or her right mind believe this latest sodomy allegation okay i said right mind prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi wants the police to charge anwar while the cabinet is against it the cabinet feels there is no evidence not only to convict anwar but even to charge him in the first place but abdullah wants the police to pursue the case and to charge anwar as i said no one in his right mind would believe the allegation against anwar but then abdullah is not a person known to be in his right mind
593306 and why does abdullah want so much for the police to charge anwar simple because his deputy najib tun razak would invariably get dragged into this whole mess the police have recorded both najibs and his wifes statements under section 112 so that means najib and rosmah would both have to take the witness stand to testify during the course of the trial once that happens everything will flow freely like shit through an asshole thats been sodomised
593307 during the course of anwars impending trial malaysians will be told of the link saiful has with mumtaz jaafar malaysians will also be told who mumtaz jaafar is and what her special links with rosmah are further to that malaysians will be told about the relationship between najibs special officer khairul anas and saiful and the less than manly reputation these two buggers had while still in school yes the excitement and kinky sex that is going to spill over from this trial will cause astro to lose a lot of business
593308 the anwar sodomy trial will hurt najib more than it will hurt anwar at the end of the trial the court will declare that there is not enough evidence to secure a conviction it will be a long five or six years but eventually anwar will be free however during the course of the five to six year trial anwar will have to sit in jail because he will be denied bail yes anwar will be free in the end but only after spending five to six years in jail without bail
593309 najib however will not get off that easily anwar will contest the permatang pauh parliament seat and will win his majority will be even larger than wan azizahs on 8 march 2008 and this is because anwar will be contesting the by election from behind the walls of the sungai buloh prison and everyone knows he does not deserve to be in prison so he will garner massive sympathy votes
593310 no this is not a case of anwar being set up for a fall under false allegations of sodomy

593342 this strategic plan reflects the ideas and direction of the chairman hh sheikh mansour bin zayed al nahyan in charting a course for developing a modern and efficient judicial system
593343 as clearly outlined in the strategic plan the mission of the abu dhabi judicial department is to safeguard the rule of law by ensuring justice freedom and peace in society the departments vision which describes its future model state is to be an efficient and independent judicial system based on excellence that provides world class judicial services this vision is based on the departments values of maintaining judicial independence fairness and integrity customer service commitment to excellence and teamwork
593344 excellence shall be the criteria and principle upon which all services rely
593345 we will also strive to provide high quality services as quickly as possible and meet the needs of all entities
593346 while the abu dhabi judicial department is currently involved in many transformation initiatives the strategic plan is a critical component in ensuring a structured approach for managing these development efforts
593347 this plan will further enhance the abu dhabis judicial system to contribute to security safety and justice
593348 we have delivered the final design and structural design to nakheel the requirement was to design a truly iconic bridge something the world hasnt seen before
593349 this is a very important part of the project since it is the entrance to the palm jebel ali
593350 there have been changes to the design from the concept stage when we won the competition but that is what we call an optimisation of the design
593351 initially the design brief asked for a six lane motorway we were then asked to change it into an eight lane one
593352 when we were asked to widen the roads we thought it seemed structurally impossible and the pylons would not be able to bear the load but we sat with the best engineers and conducted many peer reviews we found out that it had actually become more feasible to build this bridge and the change in the design would actually make the deck more stable we discovered that apparently the wider the deck the more stable the bridge
593353 the bridge is not floating literally but only in a poetic way
593354 the location is a great open water body separating the distinctly different worlds of dubai waterfront on one side and the palm jebel ali on the other so the bridge is the moment and the place where the two are linked
593355 this site requests a powerful profile and a cable stayed bridge is the answer not just any cable stayed bridge but one where the deck and the pylons are fully separated this creates a very spectacular floating image and is a first in terms of its structural solution
593356 we have separated the pylon from the deck and the only connection in this structure will be the web of cables itself
593357 the shapes themselves are not just complex but would have been impossible to calculate structurally with the current advances in computer technology over the past 15 years it is now possible to produce 3d elements into structural shapes
593358 the pylons and the deck edges are designed as complex curves that will reflect the abundant gulf daylight in a beautiful way
593359 structurally a cable stayed bridge stabilises itself so it is ideal for this project given the nature of its location
593360 there are cases of people burning chickens alive to death here there are many important welfare issues to be addressed

593366 we all know that plastic bags are disastrous couple that with a need to raise funds for our non profit organisation and i decided it was worth a try to get sponsorship for eco friendly shopping bags
593367 we do hope that these bags wont be discarded as frequently as most plastic bags

593393 on the basis of the sacrifice of jesus christ have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to jehovah to do his will
593394 do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of jehovahs witnesses in association with gods spirit directed organization
593395 these vows are publicly made often in front of thousands of people now the discerning reader should also attempt to reconcile the jehovahs witness baptismal criteria wherever possible to 2nd thessalonians 2 4 and our lord jesus christs commandment at matthew 28 19
593396 baptismal candidates must acknowledge publicly that on the basis of jesus sacrifice they have repented of their sins and have dedicated themselves to jehovah they must also understand that dedication and baptism identify them as jehovahs witnesses
593397 the entire baptismal arrangement including this public expression of faith is essential for salvation

593402 there are thousands of millions of persons living on earth today millions of these are now learning of the wonderful opportunity of keeping on living upon it
593403 we have concluded a covenant with death and with she ol we have effected a vision the overflowing flash flood in case it should pass through will not come to us for
593404 16 therefore this is what the sovereign lord jehovah has said
593405 the one who is and who was and who is coming
593406 and you made them a kingdom and priests to our god and they are to rule over the earth
593407 look i am coming as a thief happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness

593417 hear the word of jehovah you men who are trembling at his word
593418 when it is necessary to disfellowship an unrepentant wrongdoer from the congregation a brief announcement is made simply stating
593419 name of person is no longer one of jehovahs witnesses
593420 who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom the master appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time 46 happy is that slave if his master on arriving finds him doing so 47 truly i say to you he will appoint him over all his belongings
593421 i came to start a fire on the earth and what more is there for me to wish if it has already been lighted indeed i have a baptism with which to be baptized and how i am being distressed until it is finished making this decision will not result in a peaceful circumstance inside the congregations of jehovahs witnesses some family members may choose to remain loyal to satans invented baptism while another close family member chooses to be loyal to jesus christ and the baptism he commanded the scripture in luke chapter 12 goes on to describe divisions in regard to his baptism jesus christ himself is looking forward to see and has for a long time waited for these divisions to happen do you imagine i came to give peace on the earth no indeed i tell you but rather division for from now on there will be five in one house divided three against two and two against three they will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against her mother mother in law against her daughter in law and daughter in law against her mother in law
593422 at the day when i am producing a special property and i will show compassion upon them just as a man shows compassion upon his son who is serving him 18 and you people will again certainly see the distinction between a righteous one and a wicked one between one serving god and one who has not served him
593423 and the rest became frightened and gave glory to the god of heaven
593424 its something that i feel pretty adept to and thats where ive been making most my plays so hopefully ill get a shot there
593425 anytime you start making plays they seem to come in bunches
593426 so hopefully ill be able to keep that up and keep the momentum rolling
593427 its something ive been close on a couple here lately getting my hands on some ive been working on the jugs machine a little bit before practice and it seems like whenever i do that the interceptions seem to come my way its paid off and hopefully it will continue
593428 they cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle and attach them to the necks of their horses the blood stained spoils they hand over to their attendants and striking up a paean and singing a song of victory and they nail up these first fruits upon their houses just as do those who lay low wild animals in certain kinds of hunting they embalm in cedar oil the heads of the most distinguished enemies and preserve them carefully in a chest and display them with pride to strangers saying that for this head one of their ancestors or his father or the man himself refused the offer of a large sum of money they say that some of them boast that they refused the weight of the head in gold
593429 we fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you roman women for we consort openly with the best men whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest
593430 maybe i should pull the waxing kit out of the medicine cabinet
593431 please dont let me get the urge to poop my head may pop off
593432 so my butt and who ha are glued together to the bottom of the tub
593433 who is like the wild beast and who can do battle with it
593434 the ram that you saw possessing the two horns stands for
593435 and to the angel of the congregation in sar dis write these are the things that he says who has the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know your deeds that you have the name that you are alive but
593436 as though slaughtered to death but its death stroke got healed
593437 starting with 1st january 1976 all the activities of the watchtower society and of all the congregations of jehovahs witnesses in the entire world have entered under the supervision of six administrative committees of the government corps
593438 in harmony with that arrangement on february 1 1976 changes had been put into effect in all branch offices of the society around the earth
593439 but there will be reports that will disturb him out of the
593440 this is what jehovah my god has said shepherd the flock meant for the killing
593441 and the ten horns that you saw mean ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but they do receive authority as kings one hour with the wild beast 13 these have one thought and so they give their power and authority to the wild beast 14 these will battle with the lamb but because he is lord of lords and king of kings the lamb will conquer them also those called and chosen and faithful with him will do so
593442 i shall disperse them i will make the mention of them cease from mortal men
593443 our hand has proved superior and it was not jehovah who worked all this out
593444 theres nothing wrong with giving up so long as what youre giving is good and youre not giving it in too upward a direction
593445 when live gives you lemons dont put them into a story nobody needs those kind of lemons
593446 if everyone who said that voted for amp supported him he would win

593448 but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee
593449 all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee
593450 lord i only crave to be the receptacle of what the will of god means for me of the power and the gifts and the love and spirit of god
593451 what a beautiful day let us throw open the windows and bring in the sunlight with its warmth and cheerfulness
593452 who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and we have given thee of thine own
593453 come now and bring me back all that i give
593454 lord what an unspeakable privilege it is to be allowed to give that back to thee which is thine own
593455 does not god give us all good gifts to enjoy
593456 lord here is the covenant between me and thee thou delightest to give all and i delight to give back all
593457 god can do with me what he pleases i belong to him with all i have
593458 yes lord thou dost give thou dost love to give and i love to give back
593459 what do you want me to do to say i will be a missionary
593460 lord of all i belong to thee i am absolutely at thy disposal
593461 lord here i am to live and die for thy kingdom
593462 lord take it all every penny i possess it is all thine
593463 this is the second incident for both of these young men in the last year
593464 in my judgment their standing with the program is in question and they dont deserve to report with the rest of our team on sunday
593465 the president of sudan is accused of being directly linked to genocide in darfur
593466 sudan rejects these accusations there is no genocide there are just some political problems in any case we havent ratified the treaty setting up this court
593467 bears criminal responsibility in relation to 10 counts of genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes
593468 masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part the fur masalit and zaghawa groups on account of their ethnicity
593469 could be interpreted as making a link between conversion to judaism and social success
593470 one of sin s more extreme jokes certainly dangerous but rare
593471 the association of the jew money and power in one phrase which stigmatises the arrivisme of an individual
593472 it is more than unpleasant to be seen as a potential anti semite when you attack the excesses of the american empire the best friend of israel when you oppose an economically neo liberal europe or when you want to do something more than just regulate capitalism
593473 yes i am anti semitic and i am not scared to admit it i want all jews to live in fear unless they are pro palestinian let them die
593474 behind this split is a range of issues notably the positions taken by the various protagonists on the israeli palestinian conflict
593475 it is complicated and irritating and a lot of stupid uninformed things have been said the debate has been tilted
593476 they the allegations do not warrant any response anybody who has got a case to make against any south african including the president of the republic must simply approach the law enforcement agency
593477 of such fantastical proportions as not to warrant any response
593478 anyone can write a document and claim it is authentic
593479 the project which promised billions of rands in export and local sales has not happened
593480 a former south african official who had access to such information informed us in confidence that ferrostaal paid r30 million to current president thabo mbeki to gain the arms contract in the first place when questioned by investigators in south africa mbeki claimed that r2 million was given to his former deputy president jacob zuma and the rest went to the anc
593481 because mbeki maintains a tight rein on the national prosecuting authority where this matter would be dealt with
593482 here in south east queensland we are building the most comprehensive water grid that will exist in any urban environment in australia but we dont want to rest on our laurels
593483 the biggest challenge is that most aboriginal peoples numeracy and literacy levels arent that good and arent sufficient to be able to do the general mine training courses
593484 we need a lot of pre training to get people ready to join the mining industry or any kind of industry
593485 we need to have a longer term target than two years i think we need to establish cradle to grave strategies for employment and training
593486 we need to start focusing children as young as grade two and ensure that they are starting to establish the basic foundations in numeracy and literacy
593487 from the highest in the land to the employers of two or three people only the question to me is how can i help
593488 im gratified by that and i believe this is now an idea of australian employers not of mine of australian employers whose time has come
593489 what i do know is that unless you set targets unless you set goals we have one as a government its called closing the gap you turn around in five 10 or 15 years and theres no progress
593490 far better to set some ambitious goals even if you fall short and i commend andrew forrest for his ambition
593491 a welfare only response to these communities is precisely the wrong way to go
593492 weve got to get housing right weve got to get education right weve got to get health right but weve also got to get jobs right
593493 and thats where corporate australia comes in and i look forward very much to partnering with our major australian corporations in what is their initiative
593494 ive hung around corporate australia for a number of years ive heard a lot of goodwill from people but ive never been actually sure about whether those doors are openable from the outside
593495 theres a secret labor policy to review injecting rooms and consider injecting rooms on the new south wales model
593496 we now have the head of queensland health being the person who introduced injecting rooms in new south wales seven years ago
593497 the queensland government ruled this out a number of years ago it is unnecessary brisbane is a very different city to sydney and we arent seeing drug takers dead on our streets as they were in sydney
593498 the phone calls ive had from liberal party members vindicates what ive done and whats happened and so im very pleased with this move
593499 its certainly not sour grapes ive had enough wins and enough losses in my life and i think i can handle a pre selection
593500 no te quiero sino porque te quiero y de quererte a no quererte llego y de espararte cuando no te espero pasa mi corazon del frio al fuego

593502 well it has been a while i wondered if you guys wanted to shoot me again
593503 i just love being in front of a camera but my favorite is boy girl hardcore
593504 when i took my break from adult entertainment i still did regular modeling of clothing and swimsuits i also did artistic modeling and cartoon modeling so i stayed busy with modeling just not in the adult genre now im happy i decided to come back
593505 this phenomenon has not been really taken into account yet and we need to explore and understand it
593506 this is now of a much greater scale than we have ever seen before the problem is knowing who is just fund raising or running websites who is recruiting and who is a potential bomber
593507 then how do you pick up someone coming in from outside the eu thats hard to do
593508 time and again we have seen al qaeda trying tactics in one place and if they work trying them again elsewhere
593509 women are largely responsible for support material medicine food clothes
593510 but some have more major roles last year we dismantled a logistical network run by a woman
593511 seek to recruit women with a brother father or son already with the extremist groups
593512 zawahiri has been killed by them several times but once again this is baseless
593513 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
593514 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
593515 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
593516 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
593517 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
593518 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
593519 the mother had locked the children and had gone out and this is why the children were unable to escape
593520 the ioc put in place a working group with bocog the beijing organising committee for the games of the xxix olympiad to start examining those sites that the international media thought should be unblocked
593521 the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but we will work on it and deal with any potential grievances
593522 arbitrarily blocking and unblocking websites is not true respect for freedom of expression the government can turn off the tap as soon as they want
593523 the filtering programmes are probably turned up high but because they are trying to make sure that foreign language sites that journalists care about dont get blocked there are going to be lots of leaks in the system
593524 can i copy off your test again after you unintelligible
593525 guys love the show listen to your podcast every week you are my religion
593526 oh my gosh thats actually the building that i live in

593528 and so the decision on behalf of the cdc was to focus to a testimony on public health benefits there are public health benefits to climate change

593530 oh maybe i should get liposuction but maybe i should just not eat chocolate maybe i should cut back on what food i eat
593531 i really shouldnt get that chocolate cake i really shouldnt get that chocolate cake i really shouldnt get that chocolate cake
593532 okay i get what theyre going at oh this part is interesting oh a lot of fluff blah blah blah
593533 oh my god why arent we doing tests of our magazine or newspaper buys or of our hr procedures
593534 not many people have thought seriously about the interactions between a superfluid and a superconductor that are co existing like this
593535 the role of the bathhouse has shrunk and they have been under a lot of pressure both architecturally and financially
593536 the united nations cultural agency unesco has protected the baths lying inside the old town wall since the seventies but conservations are particularly concerned about those in other parts of the city which have largely been neglected
593537 are used for their original purposes and are affordable to all not just the rich
593538 reviving the role of bathhouses is meant to revive old rituals and customs
593539 i have not paid a single cent for gasoline after driving two thirds around the world so far
593540 i voted across the racial divide i have no obligations to do something in my community or around the world
593541 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth
593542 it seems longevity and marriage are directly linked and marriage is good for your health the daily telegraph quoted australian minister justine elliot whose office analyzed the figures as saying
593543 i chose sudeep because he is a very good performer i was impressed with many of his films i have seen two of his films my autograph and ranga s s l c when i was writing the script i though he would be perfectly suited for the lead character in the film he worked very hard and has managed to get his lines correct and i am sure that he has done his home work properly
593544 a solution can be found without demolishing the ram setu but it looks that the state s ruling dravida munnettra kazhagam dmk and central government which are allies are adamant on demolishing it at any cost but we will not allow them
593545 de cursus vond ik erg leuk lekker een dag actief bezig zijn en experimenteren met de mogelijkheden dit heeft mijn enthousiasme nog meer vergroot

593547 the figure is still quite impressive and i estimate this will rise substantially in the next few years
593548 china has become a notable factor in the scientific landscape usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in china so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future
593549 any addition to the armm will be by plebiscite and this plebiscite will not happen without the enabling law enacted by congress
593550 we are not giving away sovereignty and territorial integrity of the philippines it is just enabling the bangsamoro muslim nation to be in one place in one contiguous area
593551 buying presents to impress women has been a key part of mating rituals in humans for some time but it appears that it is the act of generosity rather than the gift itself which is being used as a mating signal
593552 we have found in previous studies that women are attracted to generous men they seem to like heroic types for short term relationships but altruists for long term relationships
593553 generosity could be a way for men to show their suitability to invest in a relationship and help in rearing offspring

593556 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
593557 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
593558 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
593559 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
593560 i wasnt expecting anybody alive at the bottom of the shaft so i was shocked
593561 i think she probably went down head first and landed on her back
593562 i love making buttons and shirts and playing drums i mean i learned how to play drums completely

593573 toy maker fisher price is recalling 83 types of toys including the popular big bird elmo dora and diego characters because their paint contains excessive amounts of lead
593574 mattel inc the worlds largest toymaker said a recall of 1 5 million chinese made products will reduce second quarter operating income by almost 50 percent and that it will review the production methods of all its contractors in china
593575 the recall is particularly alarming since mattel known for its strict quality controls is considered a role model in the toy industry for how it operates china fisher price toys have been a model manufacture in china
593576 tainted products u s officials have raised alarm about tainted products from china which produces 80 percent of the worlds toys including seafood containing harmful drugs toothpaste with an ingredient found in antifreeze and pet food containing a chemical used to make plastic
593577 allmark said the recall was troubling because fisher price has had a long standing relationship with the chinese vendor which had applied decorative paint to the toys allmark said the company would use this recall as an opportunity to put even better systems in place to monitor vendors whose conduct does not meet mattels standards
593578 this is to maintain the influence of home office fresh
593579 why is it that as we grow older we are so reluctant to change it is not so much that new ideas are painful for they are not it is that old ideas are seldom entirely false but have truth great truth in them the justification for conservatis45am is the desire to preserve the truths and standards of the past its dangers of which we are seldom aware is that in preserving those values we may miss the infinitely greater riches that lie in the future

593587 if someone here knew he was a sheriff its kind of like a trophy to kill one of them
593588 one of our greatest challenges is that indigenous participation is relatively new to the olympic movement there is no template we can follow no clear indicators for how we measure our success indigenous participation in past games such as calgary and salt lake city has focused primarily on ceremonies and cultural programs we plan to go beyond that to set the bar higher with the hope that future organizing committees can be inspired and learn from our experience

593613 they thought the library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books which was true enough but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library

593615 the question seldom addressed is where medusa had snakes underarm hair is an even more embarassing problem when it keeps biting the top of the deodorant bottle

593620 i was good the last two days but friday night i got jammed twice
593621 a day off might be helpful i think its affected him a little bit
593622 it felt really good to get back out there get an inning under my belt and get back to the swing of things
593623 it felt like my major league debut its been so long its good to get that one out the way
593624 there was just a little swelling friday and they thought itd be best to take a day off
593625 if you want to talk pitching ok but i dont care about the home run
593626 its good we put runs up its good we had rallies but i just dont care about that i care that we won
593627 i thought when he hit that home run that it seemed like he did that a lot when he was with the angels
593628 i dont want to say we make it up as we go along
593629 but we go out there without a game plan and we both make an analysis in the first couple of innings what are the hitters trying to do what is the umpire calling whats working for me
593630 im trying to do that every start i make and jose has a great feel for it too he makes changes and adjustments on the fly and not all catchers can do that
593631 i havent been in a pitchers meeting since mid april
593632 rather than hearing about a guys strengths and how i couldnt pitch him here or there id just rather go in with a blank slate and see what was working
593633 when i saw the empty locker and the no 15 it really brought it home
593634 i am so grateful to mr george steinbrenner and the yankees for keeping it for 29 years

593640 but i wouldve liked that opportunity im not going to lose any sleep over it its their decision
593641 maybe they dont want a guy like me in the clubhouse
593642 probably not i was working out in january and february thinking of a chance to get back in the game i didnt get any calls then you start occupying your time you dont want to bring yourself up to be shut down you know i dont want to be put in that situation now its time for these young guys to come out and do the job and hopefully they can
593643 take the headphones off and pay attention to the game and have fun with their teammates theyll see this is a great game

593646 it was like a social center crowded with the noble folks from the block and id delight in listening to some great sports gab
593647 they dont give strong well conditioned athletes a chance to finish games anymore when i pitched i got stronger a second wind in the last innings of a game and felt better than i did in the middle innings
593648 managers and teams have different pressures on them now than what we had
593649 we had opportunities to do something stupid and we didnt do it

593708 ah che bella la londra di questi anni dove ogni vizio sotto la tutela del re
593709 sono sempre stato molto curioso della vostra vita c chi vorrebbe multarvi chi vi dipinge come figlie del demonio non manca degli uomini che vi esaltino ma oltre a dostoevskij non mi viene in mente nessuno che abbia tentato una conoscenza disinteressata
593710 la prassi vorrebbe che noi facessimo qualcosa di pi che chiacchierare
593711 quando tutte queste convenzioni si sono erette a dogmi da quando non abbiamo pi la libert di decidere della nostra vita fuori da paletti ben fissati e sempre troppo stretti
593712 vede io richiedo la mia tariffa per il tempo che impiego non per le prestazioni che do questo se lo ricordi
593713 cos il piacere fisico di fronte a quello intellettuale qualcosa di diverso e lei non mi dica che parlo come un libro stampato perch una simile espressione la si trova solo nei libri e quindi la sua critica sarebbe suscettibile dello stesso tipo di critica
593714 inizio a pensare che preferire fare il mio lavoro invece che fingermi una psichiatra
593715 ci manca tanto cos che io riesca ad imparare qualcosa sia gentile con me mi conceda un paio di minuti
593716 non ho niente da insegnare io e questo non un posto adatto le tende hanno il colore sbagliato
593717 mi stai innervosendo davvero cosa ti costa fingerti gentile staremmo meglio entrambi arrivederci addio

593721 no non mi servono scarpe nuove e meno ancora scarpe usate
593722 la maggior parte dei miei clienti compra la mia merce perch sente che gli manca qualcosa e cerca di mascherare questa mancanza sviando la propria attenzione perch quando facciamo unazione sempre per noi stessi o direttamente o indirettamente
593723 oh s continua cos i discorsi che sembrano innovativi ma nascondono immense banalit sono i miei preferiti
593724 non fare lo spiritoso dicevo si vede lontano un miglio che anche a te manca qualcosa e non quel genere di vuoto che si possa riempire con un acquisto sempre che esista un vuoto del genere chiaro anche che per te il problema non chiaro e faresti meglio a fare qualcosa per tentare di risolverlo invece che passeggiare per un mercatino delle pulci in cui le pulci sono solo in testa a qualche losco figuro mi viene da pensare che se non fossi cos simpatico non mi resterebbe molto se ho iniziato a parlare con te non per rivelarti qualche verit non sono un libro sacro apprezzo la sincerit ti ho chiamato qui per cercare di imparare qualcosa ma non voglio lasciarti parlare alza la faccia fammi vedere i tuoi occhi s esattamente come temevo addio addio tieni questo ciondolo per ricordarti della mia esistenza vedi se riesci a sciogliere il nodo che ora ti faccio dietro il collo ma non tagliare la corda
593725 ma non crede anche lei che ogni sfoggio di forza sia un sintomo evidenze di una scarsa fiducia nella propria stabilit
593726 non ricordo pi perch sto qui a parlare con lei
593727 potrei imparare qualcosa da lei non ostante quello che dice ma non faccia quella faccia non mi spari me ne torno a casa

593740 after viewing the two alternative outline proposals being presented by the foundation din l art helwa is of the opinion that with appropriate safeguards and careful attention to any structural or archaeological issues the proposal to extend the museum by excavating part of st johns square has merit and deserves further study
593741 in principle din l art helwa is therefore in favour of the search for solutions to increase the exhibition spaces of the museum
593742 it is imperative that the collection of original artefacts of st johns is kept together and not dispersed in other museums or locations

593809 men and women are getting married later so obviously men and women are both sexually frustrated but women have no way of showing their sexual frustration

593884 congress wisely decided long ago that mathematical things cannot be patented surely nobody could apply mathematics if it were necessary to pay a license fee whenever the theorem of pythagoras is employed the basic algorithmic ideas that people are now rushing to patent are so fundamental the result threatens to be like what would happen if we allowed authors to have patents on individual words and concepts novelists or journalists would be unable to write stories unless their publishers had permission from the owners of the words algorithms are exactly as basic to software as words are to writers because they are the fundamental building blocks needed to make interesting products what would happen if individual lawyers could patent their methods of defense or if supreme court justices could patent their precedents
593885 there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever not a single iota that software patents have promoted or will promote progress
593886 in the majority of cases in software patents affect independent invention get a dozen sharp programmers together give them all a hard problem to work on and a bunch of them will come up with solutions that would probably be patentable and be similar enough that the first programmer to file the patent could sue the others for patent infringement why should society reward that the programmer that filed the patent didnt work any harder because a patent might be available solving the problem was his job and he had to do it anyway yes it is a legal tool that may help you against your competitors but ill have no part of it its basically mugging someone
593887 sap would not need patents to protect its investments and is collecting them only as a defensive weapon to prepare for litigation in the u s

593928 the question is why its taken the americans so long to see what the isi is doing
593929 weve been telling them for years but they wouldnt buy it
593930 there is no involvement by the isi of any form in afghanistan
593931 the security of pakistan afghanistan the entire region and maybe that of the whole world will be determined by developments in the tribal areas over the next few months
593932 the indian embassy bombing seems to have finally provided it this is the smoking gun weve all been looking for
593933 what we were trying to do was bring national security and the war on terror under the interior ministry but it was wrongly announced
593934 they said they were still waiting for a signal to act in the tribal areas to be honest none of us could think of a thing they had done in six months

593959 before and immediately after august 8 we will not see persistent heavy rainfall
593960 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
593961 it is impossible to tell at what time the rain will fall on august 8 but we cannot exclude that there will be periodic rain then
593962 normally a typhoon can affect an area for one or two days
593963 it would not have a long term effect but would only have an effect for a limited period
593964 i was personally insulted by this anyone else want to start s in this house believe that you going home believe that

593967 not enough is done at the very top end of the tourist market
593968 everyone in bordeaux thinks people wait on bended knee for their wines but nowadays excellent wines are produced all over the world
593969 the oenotourism trend in bordeaux is more oriented towards volume agencies and hotels and restaurants catering to the very top end are harder to find
593970 in my view luxury tourism can only be tailor made for very small groups often of two people
593971 we have no limits really it is up to what people want
593972 americans are the avid wine lovers they are looking for discoveries to learn about different grapes and comparisons with californian wines they want to know the history
593973 the russians stay two or three days with a chauffeur and an interpreter and have very heavy tasting schedules
593974 there are more and more luxury clients but the competition is tough
593975 places like italy spain and portugal have made huge efforts we have lessons to learn
593976 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
593977 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
593978 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
593979 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area
593980 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
593981 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
593982 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
593983 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
593984 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained

593989 we have to think about affirmative action and craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
593990 lets do what we want to do and then simply talk about it in their language and ideas
593991 since in their worldview they do not think what we are doing is possible they will think we are doing what they want us to be doing because we are talking their language we will be left alone to do exactly what we want to do right under their noses they will be happy and we will be happy without there being any need for confrontation soon they will discover that we are growing and they are not because they are stuck standing there watching us
593992 how can we do this in a way which works fully for those in the enterprise and those in the community rather than for one more than the other
593993 if these ideas are true what kind of an organization does it suggest
593994 work is the means adopted for attaining a higher level of satisfaction for human aspirations and demonstrating collaboration with the other members of the community to promote the common good to ensure that it is contributed freely productively and in a manner that makes everyones collaboration viable the members shall respect its discipline namely a hierarchy
593995 when humans are confronted with conflict their mind brains shift to a very primitive and highly reactive way of thinking called the
593996 system of human organization that creates a conflict free environment for decision making and action implementation
593997 this is a law of life and the more lavishingly we show kindness and concern the richer is our life in what manner we get back what we have given is of minor importance the only thing that life promises is that life pays back all its debts to us
593998 for us to stand together united until this battle is won the people of berlin have spoken we have done our duty and we will keep on doing our duty people of the world now do your duty people of the world look at berlin

594013 this sort of outbreak is a very difficult thing to manage
594014 weve been working every day with this clinic to make sure that firstly the staff are as safe as we can make them that the spread of this virus is contained
594015 the long term outcome for this business is now something that we will sit down personally with dr lovell and see if there is anything that we can do to assist
594016 a bit of a reality check might be good for the guys bring us back down to earth
594017 the work ethic within the group has been great and we prepared well for this game so i think it just reinforces how tough it is to win away from home and i think we need that heading to south africa
594018 we were confident whether we were over confident i dont know
594019 we get a couple of days off now hopefully get the niggles bumps and bruises out of the way and i guess get away from footy because its been pretty full on over the last couple of weeks and get a bit of balance going on
594020 the whole experience wasnt pleasant but the key for us is to make it a piece of growth
594021 you dont see too many roads without bends in them
594022 to be honest i think we tend to put our own barriers in front of ourselves that arent necessarily there
594023 most barriers in this game are self imposed its what you think of it if you think winning away from homes tough then its tough
594024 its a short competition move on obviously were disappointed review your game but dont dwell
594025 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all

594050 there is greater stringency in respect to the teachings of the scribes than in respect to the torah so that a biblical law may be transgressed
594051 he who teaches his daughter torah is as though he taught her lewdness
594052 the objection was to the studying of the oral law rabbi johanan feared the knowledge of gentiles in matters of jurisprudence as they would use it against the jews in their opponents courts
594053 for such knowledge might have operated against the jews in their opponents courts
594054 the name mishnah is applied in particular to the collection of halachoth or laws made by judah hanasi generally known as rabbi and his colleagues at the beginning of the 3rd century c e

594057 here three wagons full of books were burned but first they were carried through the streets of the city while royal officers proclaimed publicly that their condemnation was due to insults to christianity which they contained
594058 in 1078 he renewed the canonical laws which prohibited giving jews power over christians jews might not be employed as tax farmers or mint masters
594059 renewed the old canonical prohibitions against trusting the jews with public offices and introduced the law demanding that jews should wear a distinctive sign on their garments nevertheless he protected them against the fury of the french crusaders

594061 innocent iv ordered the burning of the talmud in paris 1244
594062 who was heavily indebted to them they the jews obtained from pope martin v 1417 31 various bulls 1418 and 1422
594063 in the last years of his pontificate however he repealed several of his ordinances charging that they had been obtained under false pretenses
594064 how could anyone reading what the talmud says see reproductions elsewhere herein argue about its contents
594065 not only repealed all the concessions of his predecessor and not only renewed the laws of paul iv but added some new restrictions
594066 introduced a large number of severe restrictions and they were obliged to send every week at least 150 of their number
594067 the worst feature under papal dominion was the closing of the gates of the roman ghetto at nights severe penalties awaited a jew leaving the ghetto after dark or a christian entering it
594068 renewed all the restrictions enacted from the 13th century the censorship of books was strictly enforced and their attendance at conversionist sermons was enforced
594069 they both had the same interest in preventing the nations from being invaded by the jewish element and thereby losing control of society
594070 judah ben ilai recommends the daily recital of the benediction blessed be thou who hast not made me a goy
594071 who hast made me an israelite who hast not made me a slave
594072 be on their guard against these hardened condemned people who accuse god of lying and proudly despise the whole world they are boastful proud fools
594073 and a worldly king who would slay the christians divide the world among the jews and make them rich lords
594074 they themselves are the servants of corruption for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they had known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to its wallowing in the mire
594075 of such are the remaining dregs of the jews of whom moses knows nothing they also know nothing of him for they do not keep one passage in moses

594102 everything is its own situation and has its own reason it just didnt work
594103 i knew that going in but you dont really see everything until you work someplace
594104 its kind of a unique situation a private school competing against big state universities we had the smallest budget in the conference theres no way you could match dollar for dollar with texas so you had to learn alternative ways for getting things done i would say i learned a lot
594105 i think i left that program in a lot better shape than i found it
594106 i was really interested in that because it was so close to our house
594107 but some things kept changing with the situation it just didnt work out
594108 my answer is why not i wanted to coach some ball and work with kids i wasnt hung up on pay or prestige or stuff like that

594123 the day me and my wife first came in here ken was back behind the back counter cutting steaks and i said ken how would you like to sell this place
594124 woolstenhulmes forbearers helped settle the kamas valley and ken a lifelong resident has served as oakleys mayor and lds bishop among other positions he also has been a member of the south summit school board and sits on the summit county commission
594125 karen raised the kids here all five of our kids grew up here
594126 when you come in here you know the people at the counter you know who prepared the salsa they have really good salsa and ken would give you a special cut of meat

594130 we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
594131 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
594132 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both
594133 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
594134 hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
594135 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
594136 you can always tell who the pioneers are theyre the ones with all the arrows sticking out of their backs
594137 even though they the sec would never admit it patrick byrne helped instruct them in the danger when the time came they understood the threat
594138 what i dont understand is why the sec is only addressing fannie mae freddie mac and the large investment banks why should those companies be the only ones protected
594139 we know it has been going on and that its been harmful to share prices
594140 one of the big concerns we have is that depositors often can not distinguish the difference between a stock price dropping and the safety of their deposits and soundness of their bank
594141 rather than fixing any of the real problems with the agency and its mission cox and his fellow commissioners waved a newspaper and swatted the imaginary fly of naked short selling it made a big noise but theres no dead bug
594142 byrne has said that the secs politically motivated pandering means that he has won the intellectual argument on naked short selling
594143 but there hasnt been an intellectual argument there has been a campaign of intimidation and personal attacks against critics of his poor management of his company and his naked shorting jihad
594144 what theyre saying is that if he only ran a better liquor store he wouldnt get robbed as much
594145 then she mentioned about how shed read about all the horrible things i was doing and how it appeared like id gone completely off the deep end
594146 as we sat down he said patrick i want you to know that you have become the most hated man ive ever known in all my life here in new york

594155 nobody thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what they are going to try to do is make you scared of me
594156 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all of those other presidents on the dollar bills
594157 seriously thats basically the argument its like well we dont have very much to offer but hes risky
594158 the question you have to ask yourself is whats more risky going ahead and bringing about changes that we know that we have to make in order to ensure that our children have a better future or doing the same things over and over again even though we know they dont work
594159 we are in a time right now where it is too risky not to change
594160 they say that hes arrogant that hes unpatriotic blah blah blah
594161 i know this man he is humble he is devoutly christian he loves his family more than anything else in the world he cares about families he reveres our men and women in uniform and he is as red white and blue as you could possibly get
594162 im ready to duel john mccain on taxes right now right here im a quick draw
594163 theyre going to say hes a tax and spend liberal democrat
594164 but its the same ad over and over again so let me be absolutely clear if you are a family making less than 250 000 a year you will not see your taxes go up
594165 im ready to duel john mccain on taxes right now right here im a quick draw

594172 they say that hes arrogant that hes unpatriotic blah blah blah
594173 i know this man he is humble he is devoutly christian he loves his family more than anything else in the world he cares about families he reveres our men and women in uniform and he is as red white and blue as you could possibly get
594174 you know i dont pay attention to john mccains ads although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for and not just what hes against
594175 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all of those other presidents on the dollar bills
594176 theyre trying to make you scared of me because im black

594211 d they sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt
594212 and josephs master took him and put him in the prison a place where the kings prisoners were confined
594213 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in to pharaoh
594214 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
594215 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
594216 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
594217 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
594218 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt

594233 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
594234 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
594235 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
594236 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline

594253 community tree planting took place on sunday 27 july at four sites throughout maroondah and council staff did their bit at croydon town park at lunchtime on tuesday 29 july
594254 maroondah city council plants 30 000 trees and shrubs every year and if you combine the number of trees in public and private land youll find there are more than 500 000 trees in maroondah
594255 there are numerous reasons why we need trees not least that they are the earths lungs inhaling carbon dioxide and removing greenhouse gas from the atmosphere then exhaling oxygen for humans to breathe
594256 in addition trees provide habitat and food for the many different species of wildlife that we are fortunate to enjoy in maroondah

594261 if the network isnt available due to a logical or physical incident its a revenue impacting event so security was seen by our company leaders as an integral component of the business architecture
594262 realized security needed to be integrated into the architecture of the business
594263 it can provide an enterprisewide perspective and accountability for managing the risks to the business so then security becomes not just securitys a business concern
594264 if i didnt have the visibility of where the organization was going where the c level folks were going the new technologies coming it would be hard to put together a business plan to the requirements of the organization
594265 because i have such access and visibility to the c level leadership they know what im doing its not a mystery they know my resources whats being spent
594266 that doesnt have a cso reporting at the c level with visibility and accountability at that level
594267 our rule is if you call anybody in corporate security on any issue we dont tell them to call fred in the other group we dial the number for them they dont know theyre talking to the wrong an invisible transfer to the customer

594269 that approach may work once or twice in a true crisis situation where the bad guys have come over the back fence
594270 but when you approach corporate officers with the tactics of fear youre walking into a trap somebody will eventually say ok show me where the real emergency is and then your credibility is shot
594271 they got worked into such a frenzy that it was like a runaway train
594272 the iso is going to the ceo saying theres a chance something bad and possibly something embarrassing could happen
594273 but how much of a chance the iso doesnt know and if he spends this kind of money he can reduce the risk but by how much he doesnt know there is simply not enough data every other c level executive does better than that and takes on the responsibility for defining the risk here the ciso is putting the responsibility on the ceo the ceo doesnt want it and eventually he wont take it
594274 im not sure why it tends to disregard these tools
594275 its a bit frustrating to keep hearing that you cant do it accurately that is not true the tools are there nuclear uses them pharma uses them the whole world has used roi in security for a long time csos have an opportunity to make a major contribution in their organization if they have the willingness to learn this
594276 they dont understand that you can make rough guesses to work out a problem we dive into an rosi study and the engineers are focused on the minutiae and want to argue for days whether some variable should be 6 or 55 it doesnt matter

594281 and now i am proud to present a more than worthy 2008 presidential candidate mr ralph nader
594282 let me start in a more fundamental way the problems we have in this country start with how individuals in the millions use their time thats where it all starts i grew up in a small town in connecticut it had a town meeting form of government and the town meeting was the legislature the local legislature and you could just walk to the town meeting there were no obstacles to going into the auditorium or the town hall to decide important issues in the community it was in my judgement the most pristine form of democracy in the world you really cant do much better than that we had a local daily newspaper if we didnt print what you liked you could canvas the whole town it was ten thousand people
594283 there was no excuse for not having a very democratic form of government with all the benefits that come from that the quality of government in our town was directly related to how many people turned out how many people voted how many people showed up and when people showed up wed work out our problems nobody won everything people didnt show up power moved into a concentrated format the factory owners or the local politicos in other words if the dynamic of citizen engagement is weak power flows to the few against the many and that means that those few make decisions in their favor against the majority the masses of the people and thats why we get these political candidates at the presidential and congressional level who speak in such generalities that their rhetoric belies their record of almost never in congress or in the white house proposing anything that shifts power from the few to the many for example public funding of public campaigns we dont do that for example national referendums with binding power wed nader would do that
594284 getting rid of the taft hartley act of 1947 the most notorious anti union worker law in the western world and letting tens of millions of workers whom surveys show want to form trade unions to engage in collective bargaining with their employers that would shift power
594285 opening up the courts so that wrongfully injured people or defrauded people there are enough of us in that category could have their full day in court before a judge and jury instead of being restricted by this notorious misnamed tort reform movement perpetrated by the insurance companies and the wrong doers corporate lobby that would shift power 90 of all people wrongfully injured in this country never even filed a claim do you know how bad that is

594320 it is a lot more likely the government will push even harder behind kingsnorth power station now that the brakes have been put on their nuclear plans
594321 i am deeply concerned because it is a false choice the government should be asking how to shift to a sustainable energy infrastructure and away from fossil fuels and nuclear power
594322 the democratic process will go out the window if the nuclear side is delayed from the governments point of view they have got to address the energy problem so they will look to coal and get that up and running

594343 i have pleasure in stating that i have at length completed the task which the newspaper press and public men of different parties urged upon me from 1855 to 1860
594344 what do you mean to take toll of us then
594345 i was just reading a book and the guy beside me was standing up and stabbing another guy with a rambo knife
594346 we went to the front and he was holding the head in his hand and then just dropped it there
594347 i feel safe i dont think a security guard could have stopped that thats a spontaneous act by some crazy guy so i dont think security would make that much difference

594353 ludacris heavily favors the east coast to the west save for seattle san francisco sacramento and las vegas
594354 there is a ho belt phenomenon nearly synonymous with the bible belt
594355 ludacris has a disproportionate ho zone in rural nebraska he might favor white women as much as he does black women or perhaps girls who farm
594356 ludacris has hoes in the midway and wake islands only scientists are allowed to inhabit the midway islands and only military personnel may inhabit the wake islands draw your own conclusion
594357 granting an evil calculated killer any kind of dispensation is criminal and leaves the judiciary with blood on its hands
594358 the decision to surrender to the appeal of this cold blooded murderer is nothing but unforgivable i urge you to do whatever is needed to reverse this travesty of justice
594359 to say that i and the 140 000 police officers i represent throughout england and wales are appalled and disgusted with the decision that david bieber will now not serve a whole life sentence is a gross understatement and my heart goes out to pc ian broadhursts family
594360 this is shockingly disrespectful to his memory and illustrates the utter travesty of our criminal justice system where the rights of a cop killer outweigh the rights of a fallen officers family friends and colleagues david bieber is a monster with no consideration for life
594361 the fact that his appeal was initially lodged on the grounds that it contravened his human rights is ludicrous he showed no mercy or concern for human rights when he ignored pc broadhursts appeal pleading for his life before being executed at point blank range

594369 oasis are an english rock band that formed in manchester in 1991
594370 ours could be described as a surveillance society unless trust in the government u2019s intentions in relation to data and data sharing is preserved
594371 the foundation for all new surveillance technologies is the database u201d
594372 that the home office publish its plans for collecting and retaining administrative information as part of the nir national identity register and that it commit to a principle of data minimisation for the national identity scheme
594373 in fact it starts from a recognition of the importance of something which is fundamental to the rights of the individual the right to have your identity protected and secure
594374 i believe that the new plan for the id card scheme announced by the home secretary in march included important steps in the direction of the principle of data minimization which the committee recommends
594375 it will now be legal to eavesdrop and spy on people who are not under any kind of suspicion were not talking about yemen north korea or the former gdr here but about sweden
594376 what is it about the current labour government that it is unable to tolerate any criticism of its policies and actions and why is it frightened to engage openly and honestly in proper debate with the citizens of this country especially about an issue as controversial as compulsory identity cards and the setting up of a vast intrusive database state the government prefers to organise its own heavily controlled focus group meetings and private consultations away in the shadows
594377 there was a general lack of awareness across hmrc business units at least prior to the incident of the importance of information security
594378 a great deal of work will be required to bring hmrc up to and to sustain the world class standard for information security to which it now properly aspires
594379 that proper attention be paid to the privacy consent issue across the national identity scheme bag considered that the issue was not fully addressed by the publication of the strategic action plan and that the public needed to be better informed over this
594380 at a time when identity cards are compulsory and people are validated only by their digital id in the national identity database
594381 a witty and satirical look at a highly controversial government policy that will soon have a deep and far reaching effect on our everyday lives
594382 citizens inquiry into the forensic use of dna and the national dna database ndad
594383 need for a nationwide public awareness campaign about the ndnad that will reach all sections of the population
594384 should be an independent body with broad membership constituted by statue specifically to oversee the ndnad
594385 that there should be harmonisation between approaches in scotland and england and wales and that the scottish approach should be favoured
594386 any such scheme would require the fullest public debate to establish whether whatever the benefits it amounted to excessive surveillance as a step too far for the british way of life
594387 we want to know what you think so contribute contribute contribute
594388 what could 4 4bn of taxpayers money be better spent on
594389 the high german security level should also form the basis of an eu wide standard for electronic identity cards
594390 a spanish particularity is that the id card is associated with a central database in which the full biometric information of all citizens photos fingerprints is stored in britain misgivings over such central registration have made the introduction of electronic identity cards highly controversial

594392 in contrast to the accepted view the brain does use fat as fuel
594393 our study shows that the minute by minute control of appetite is regulated by free radicals implying that if you interfere with free radicals you may affect eating and satiety
594394 that each time a feeling of fullness or satiety is reached during a meal you may be chipping away some time from your maximum lifespan as the most free radicals are produced when satiety promoting brain cells are active
594395 the timing of taking antioxidants may be critical for the control of appetite
594396 if taken on an empty stomach antioxidants may further increase appetite however when taken with food they may affect satiety further studies are needed to determine whether any regiment of orally taken antioxidants could be used to control appetite in animals and humans
594397 these findings are so clear and detailed at the level of molecular behavior that they will be most valuable to developing more effective therapies for mood disorders and neurologic and psychiatric diseases and to direct effective treatments for drug addiction to cocaine and amphetamines
594398 this research may also open the door to the development of new therapies for dopamine neurotransmitter disorders such as parkinsons disease schizophrenia and anxiety and depression
594399 crystallography had allowed the identification of only one structural form of the molecule but our experiments and computations were able to identify how this form changes and thereby add an understanding of the functional role of the different forms that the molecule must adopt to accomplish transport activity
594400 this finding might steer anti cocaine therapy in a completely new direction
594401 were real families we all depend on our paychecks and when they are taken away for political games it affects us more than people think

594409 ive never come across a situation where i feel i need to see the patient in person
594410 its a lot easier than going to the yard to see the doctor
594411 we had specialty services our equipment talks to each other
594412 im pleasantly surprised with their lack of concern about not seeing a live doc
594413 maybe theyre getting attention they previously werent given maybe they grew up with tvs and they accept it as the way business is done
594414 he looks at technology as real tools to solve the prisons problems hes investing in these tools
594415 considering this is the beginning of august we cant complain
594416 the purchase of land by out of county water districts makes us nervous
594417 until we see some real legitimate response from these entities being willing to work with us well continue to be paranoid about it
594418 as we look to improve our water supply situation we know that is directly tied to the ecosystem
594419 so we need to start making smart investments in the ecosystem if were going to see these co equal goals advance together
594420 there certainly is an urgency because the delta is broken and we have species that are on the verge of extinction
594421 our ability to move water through the delta is going to depend on the health of these species
594422 we want you to know were there in good faith

594426 the cemetery lends itself to telling the history of sacramento
594427 it was very much like this tour and i think well bill you could do some more research
594428 there was nothing for a young woman to do in sacramento in the late 19th century so aimee left and she married and she married again and again and again some of her husbands and would be husbands had duels over her she wore trousers she smoked cigars she wrote she was one of the first feminists
594429 i think its one of the all time great musicals

594440 they are building a lot of shopping centers in sacramento
594441 in an established area like san francisco its hard to find a place
594442 what i think is people will come eat quickly and gain some weight
594443 if mcdonalds was interested in the health of kids they would make sure the apple slices were in happy meals first and you would have to ask for the french fries
594444 eating a monster burger every once in a while is not going to kill anyone
594445 i think if you eat a monster burger every day it will lead to problems

594453 we are saying ok at what point did they get influenced by gangs and at what point did they join the gangs
594454 i dont know if the young ones the fourth fifth sixth graders have the skill sets to make informed choices
594455 we see a lot of broken homes among gang members
594456 they feel the streets can protect them more than their family
594457 the potential is certainly there and fascination can start around that age but we dont often see actual gang members in the courts at that age
594458 its condoned by the parents and the family theyve been born into

594593 i am and always have been a morning person so i prefer morning workouts however in order to get in the appropriate training volume i typically have both a morning and afternoon workout
594594 the main set would consist of either short speed work 100s or 200s or longer sets of 300 to 400 at a more moderate pace depending on the workout there may also be form work which forces me to focus on the technical aspects of my stroke then there is always a cooldown of 100 to 200 yards easy swimming
594595 also in triathlon there is a unique workout called a brick this is where you stack two workouts back to back similar to a race situation a typical brick workout on a weekday would be a two hour bike ride of moderate to race pace effort approximately 40 miles then a 30 minute run approximately 3 4 miles moderate to race pace effort
594596 core training basically abs and lower back i have a quick 10 minute routine i try to complete three times per week
594597 on those days when i feel unmotivated i revisit my goals or look to training partners setting goals in sport and in life is so important to staying focused and on track long term and even weekly goals that i have written down really keep me accountable if my goals dont get me moving finding a fellow triathlete to work out with is great
594598 truthfully my favorite quick meal or snack would not be helpful for training if i need something quick and healthy i will most likely pick fruit and cheese this time of year i love watermelon or grapes
594599 the night before a race i always eat a smaller than usual meal and have to forgo my favorite part dessert typically it is pasta i love macaroni and cheese with some vegetables
594600 my rudy project sunglasses basically i wear them every day since i use them for both cycling and running they are extremely lightweight blade style glasses that i have had for three years
594601 recently i had to send them in to rudy project for repair and was absolutely lost without them luckily rudy project is amazing and had them back to me within five days
594602 this past fall i had problems with both ankles first one then the other both as a result of overuse ibuprofen and rest were the keys to recovery i had to stop running for what seemed like forever it was definitely over a month until things finally returned to normal
594603 we were hoping to see the numbers increase so were a little disappointed
594604 only 10 percent of people in california are hospitalized in any given year if people know these sites are there when they need them then maybe these sites are ok
594605 consumers would like us to give a blanket overall rating for a hospital but the best we can do is objective sound measures of a specific condition there are a lot of services we dont have data for yet
594606 those are very shoppable procedures for a patient theyd have time to research it but the information is not out there yet
594607 two of the five workouts per week are what we consider hard days
594608 but if the schedule calls for a hill workout and you are dead dog tired be flexible and bag it rest days or off days are just as important as your hard days listen to your body
594609 hows his mobility huh uh huh my father had that problem
594610 it makes me gag and vomit but i think it was
594611 people want to vent i guess and thats how they do it
594612 id prefer they come in here to my office and vent
594613 unless theres some constructive criticism on these sites id hope my patients would feel comfortable talking to me or even sending me an anonymous note directly but if youre really unhappy then by all means find another doctor
594614 choosing a physician is more complicated than choosing a good restaurant and patients owe it to themselves to use the best available resources when making important decisions
594615 online opinions of physicians should be taken with a grain of salt and should certainly not be a patients sole source of information
594616 when it comes down to it most complaints about doctors are customer service related and communication issues
594617 listen anything that people spend money on needs to have transparency and be open to criticism
594618 we dont allow patients to write a treatise about their issues
594619 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
594620 if in order to get that passed w e have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
594621 if it werent for the last minute nothing would get done
594622 the coaches demand a lot of production out of us
594623 this offense is a lot to handle its not just that there are a lot of plays its about precision being precise
594624 whether that be one practice one rep or one day that creates a sense of urgency to do things now
594625 im just going to go out there try to stay healthy try to play hard and just give it all i have you know like coach said ill take it one week at a time one game at a time
594626 things got out of hand in an argument over seats in the departure lounge and several people were involved in an altercation
594627 jeg har meget sv rt ved at se det realistiske i en folkeafstemning nu hvor vi har to helt uafklarede forhold nemlig det irske nej til lissabon traktaten og danmarks egne uafklarede sp rgsm l om flygtninge indvandrerpolitikken og vores muligheder for at styre den det betyder at der lige nu er en lang r kke gode fornuftige sp rgsm l som vi ganske enkelt ikke ville kunne give borgerne svar p og i den situation kan man ikke holde en fair afstemning

594635 no tenemos ninguna confirmaci n oficial sobre la llegada de alg n ministro o si nos van a llamar para entrevistarnos con el gobernador en la capital de la provincia por lo que nosotros nos mantenemos firmes en esa ocupaci n pac fica que es una reivindicaci n territorial
594636 venimos a reivindicar nuestro derecho territorial con un acto de ocupaci n pac fica pero las medidas de acci n directa se ir n incrementando si la provincia no acusa recibo

594640 son candidaturas que han contado con un gran respaldo de firmas patrocinadoras y eso nos tiene contentos en algunos casos la ley nos exig a reunir 70 firmas y se juntaron m s de 100 eso habla de un respaldo creciente
594641 penchuleo representa para nosotros un nuevo tipo de liderazgo es un joven mapuche de la zona que ha destacado como dirigente universitario y cuya elecci n como candidato fue producto de un proceso de primarias in dito entre las comunidades de la zona
594642 podemos hacer historia en lautaro existen all cerca de 300 comunidades y los avances que hemos logrado como partido nos tienen optimistas sabemos que tenemos que trabajar duro y el mandato que la gente a entregado a luis es competir para ganar

594644 ambas candidaturas se han formalizado bajo la modalidad de independientes y eso nos exige trabajar el doble

594646 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo

594648 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
594649 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa

594667 the trouble is theres just not a lot out there right now people ask about his jerseys and you can find those on ebay but thats about it until hes out of college
594668 at one time in luke ridnours first and second year his autographed rookie card would fly out of here
594669 i barely get hit until i get to the secondary and once you get to the secondary its up to us as running backs to make a move make somebody miss and then finish off the job
594670 we were ahead and there was no reason to go back in we have a great other running back in rob knight so were kind of playing straight and thinking about the future a little bit
594671 it wasnt an injury or anything and i have to work on monday thats what that was about
594672 ive got put my hands down to the lineman they opened up holes all season long and made it possible to have the leagues two leading rushers me and rob on the same team its been a fun season
594673 what we try with our defensive line is have them occupy space and we release those linebackers i call them the hounds because theyre fast theyre physical theyre strong theyre determined and theyre the heart and soul of our defense
594674 i know so many single parent families who are struggling on less than 50 000 and their children wont even get a chance at college my family included one reader wrote

594719 the longest continuous deployment of any united states ground combat military unit during operation iraqi freedom
594720 will you regret it when youre 30 if you dont go
594721 now can you do that while you slowly rotate around the bed
594722 i dont know whats going to happen with this thing i really dont
594723 is to make sure theres a marketplace on the web for these people to make money not to build farm teams for another medium
594724 its like we are in california 100 years ago with a movie camera and a tent setting up on the side of a river
594725 its the kind of shoot where you need a permit
594726 one of the great selling points of working for next to nothing is that you can really have an opportunity to bring your vision to the screen without any interference
594727 you are all able to go to the limit to be more extreme in anything you can do than in television or film what i am really interested in is new media whats fun for me is to create stories and do things that have never been done before
594728 the danger isnt in what people do tell you its in what they dont
594729 they have not solicited and gone after people who will tell them the truth
594730 it would be suicidal for someone who wants a grant to come out and publicly criticize the foundation
594731 if we criticize the foundation in our own names our funding will be cut or we will lose our jobs
594732 if you want to achieve the greatest possible positive impact youve got to figure out how to hear things from people on the ground who might know more than you about some pretty important things
594733 theyre probably at greater risk of being isolated from critical feedback than any other foundation in the world
594734 for the most part the gates foundation does wonderful stuff
594735 it doesnt help to create a few islands of excellence in a sea of despair and unfortunately thats kind of what theyre doing
594736 clearly theyre dedicated to the public interest but if the gates foundation isnt getting it right what are the controls
594737 that we decide were just not going to give money to certain groups
594738 they need to bring in people who are tough willing to challenge them and push the envelope
594739 its my sense that they need to do more of that
594740 they are unwilling so far to be as transparent as i think they should be
594741 they need to speak to a wider range of people uncomfortable as that may be
594742 the gates foundation must prepare itself to be criticized and should welcome that criticism
594743 from the bombs there is no dead two people were admitted to songkhla hospital
594744 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
594745 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
594746 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
594747 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
594748 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained

594753 sometimes i think were alone sometimes i think were not either way the thought is staggering
594754 when you consider the sheer size of the universe the massive size of it and you consider the raw possibility for life on any given planet then refine the odds by saying it has to be intelligent life like us then refine the odds again for only places in existence where its physically possible to travel to earth then refine the odds yet again so thats theyre also alive the same time as humans are once youve done all this its not only still possible there life on other planets its a certainty
594755 there is absolutely no ground for a snap election nor has there been any delay whatsoever in a confidence vote in parliament
594756 judaism must define what judaism and jews are outside the absurd idea one has to just have a jewish mother
594757 in other words judaism must separate itself from the left and stop being another form of modern liberalism at least here in america

594796 i am happy for the children who have an opportunity to experience new trier on a daily basis shouldnt all children have the same opportunity
594797 when a public school fails parents ask only for a choice in the education of their children no entrenched bureaucracy or union should deny parents that choice and children that opportunity

594811 the decision to surrender to the appeal of this cold blooded murderer is nothing but unforgivable i urge you to do whatever is needed to reverse this travesty of justice
594812 to say that i and the 140 000 police officers i represent throughout england and wales are appalled and disgusted with the decision that david bieber will now not serve a whole life sentence is a gross understatement and my heart goes out to pc ian broadhursts family
594813 this is shockingly disrespectful to his memory and illustrates the utter travesty of our criminal justice system where the rights of a cop killer outweigh the rights of a fallen officers family friends and colleagues david bieber is a monster with no consideration for life
594814 the fact that his appeal was initially lodged on the grounds that it contravened his human rights is ludicrous he showed no mercy or concern for human rights when he ignored pc broadhursts appeal pleading for his life before being executed at point blank range

594837 a willingness to change ones lifestyle or pattern of consumption is essential but insufficient in itself to bring about societal change similarly ones action as a citizen no matter how responsible and farsighted is inadequate if ones individual behavior and lifestyle are wasteful or destructive

594843 but oh how i love the new format layout width type style pretty much everything the bee has done a great job of updating the paper and i really like it
594844 the bee can be classified as news lite like its beer namesakes it looks like a newspaper but it is a bit thin and without much serious substance short on news long on ads and not to my liking i have been a bee reader for three decades or more i hope this improves but i wont wait for very long
594845 i usually dont need reading glasses to read the paper
594846 but this morning i had to go get my glasses before i could read it a magnifying glass should be distributed with each subscription

594858 i was seven weeks back from iraq to the day at that point in time i was pulling guys off the street to come in and spar with me and grapple with me the closest thing i had for a jiu jitsu coach at that time was a blue belt
594859 i cant even imagine the difference between me the first time i fought him to now
594860 the part that i take personal anytime i fight somebody whether i win or whether i lose i dont want them to ever want to fight me again
594861 even if they beat me i want them to look back on that fight and be like you know what hey i got him tonight but i dont ever want to have to fight that guy again that just sucked being in the cage with him
594862 i fought steve and right away he wanted to fight me again

594867 we dont have a systematic training programme for our senior and junior players we will chart out a national and international calender a pool of upcoming players has to be created

594870 we could not qualify for the olympics for the first time in 80 years
594871 the problem is that people buy a fund after the manager has proved that they are a high performer but they sell the first time theres a problem
594872 they wind up chasing performance buying high and selling low instead of sticking with a manager who has proved that they can deliver if you give them enough time
594873 that they can dig out of a hole because you have to believe they can create return fast enough to help you catch up from any down period you want them to be able to live up to the expectation you had for the fund when you first bought it which means you have to believe they can get performance back to what you expected over time
594874 when a manager loses conviction in what they are doing thats a problem
594875 we had an awesome dodge charger back in june here at pocono
594876 i hope that we can run well again this weekend its going to be a real battle to make it in the chase these next six races so its real important to run consistent and stay up front

594882 the ioc is not worried not concerned its convinced athletes have the decent common sense
594883 based upon information obtained as recently as today august 1 she accepts the fact that the testing was properly done and the results properly reported
594884 the u s has been in first place for many years
594885 if china can beat the u s it will mean that although we are not number one in military power in sports we are our athletes can defeat the americans in spirit
594886 the games are going to be highly competitive because almost all of the worlds elite athletes will be here in beijing
594887 i hope my athletes perform at their best and do not let the chinese people down
594888 they are playing the same game that the soviets and east germany did going for sports with high medal counts that the united states is not all that good in

594891 i remember thinking that the dialogue was really original its sort of what i love about films such as once contemporary ireland is being portrayed in a fresh but authentic way there are all these very subtle references to multi cultural ireland that seem to work
594892 that sense of dublin is quite rare in irish dramas
594893 writers often make the mistake of taking the west wing or sex amp the city and then try to crowbar some irishness in
594894 i certainly did ads of the same ilk early on in my career so that was particularly funny

594901 bill nighy of love actually fame sticks in my mind as being one of the best to work with

594903 the feeling of making 2 000 people in an audience laugh with him next to me on the stage was an experience you dont have every day
594904 julianne moore is also a top class person and the thing about these actors is they only take interesting parts and are genuinely not into pursuing fame
594905 what ive realised is that theyre not imperious stars and they dont treat people according to the level of their profile some of them got their breaks in their 30s and theres a lot to be said for getting success later on in life
594906 id like to do some shakespeare maybe a bit more theatre but in this job you cant really make a plan
594907 you hear some careerist actors say you have to do this then do that but you can start to get a bit paranoid

594916 european continental scholarship regularly engaging in dialogue with the german school and the anglo saxon myth and ritual school
594917 the bible is not a textbook in history and it was never intended to be one what is regarded as history can only emerge from the result of the historiographers work the task of establishing what happened in the past is the ideal but it can be no more than an interpretation
594918 within the larger arena of ancient syro palestinian and ancient eastern history
594919 not only 1 what happened but also 2 how the events were understood by the ancient writers 3 how these writers wanted it to have happened that is the purpose of the writing and 4 the audience for whom they wrote
594920 but we can reconstruct part of it depending upon the character of the available sources
594921 archaeological remains can give more realistic understanding of the societies they refer to their trade and culture and so forth
594922 deal with a certain peoples self understanding and not primarily with empirical history
594923 it should be emphasized that in dealing with any society in palestine the problem is that a mere presentation of facts as they are understood is not historiography because it does not include all the facts it is therefore no more than an incomplete catalogue
594924 of a repeated change between an ideal and orderly period to an evil period of chaos

594962 everyone in bordeaux thinks people wait on bended knee for their wines but nowadays excellent wines are produced all over the world
594963 the oenotourism trend in bordeaux is more oriented towards volume agencies and hotels and restaurants catering to the very top end are harder to find

594965 we have no limits really it is up to what people want
594966 americans are the avid wine lovers they are looking for discoveries to learn about different grapes and comparisons with californian wines they want to know the history

594997 we got together in 2002 and realised we had to take that energy out into the public domain again thats when vr came about and in terms of albums loaded has been on the back burner ever since but we always play seattle at christmas and were pretty big there these days its just time to put out a new record and tour with this band again because its a very special thing we have here

595002 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
595003 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
595004 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
595005 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
595006 it was just absolutely great i got soaking wet and we gave as good as we got
595007 when i first heard about him and met him i was just inspired by his motivation to protect the parkway
595008 we want his contract to reward the impact he has had on our athletic revenue streams but he is almost as important to the whole greenville community said holland citing the coachs fundraising efforts especially the drew steele skip holtz project that has generated more than 500 000 for special olympics training facilities
595009 skip has shown more interest in the contracts of his assistant coaches than he has his own and that is why he has been able to assemble a first rate staff
595010 i love it here my wife loves it my kids love it
595011 my job is to continue to build a winner and contend year in and year out for a conference championship
595012 but overall im extremely encouraged said holtz whose passion permeated throughout the murphy center banquet room and also appeared to rev up his players
595013 health care providers are one per square inch in wake and durham and chatham counties
595014 she sits there and talks to you she explains everything
595015 i guess half the people here have her cell phone number
595016 just as soon as they come in i pay them
595017 its very shocking to people when they go on medicare
595018 you sort of have this view that this means my health care will be taken care of but once they get on medicare its not all easy going from there on out
595019 medicare doesnt have an out of pocket limit and so people who dont have supplemental insurance a medigap plan or something from a former employer can run up very high bills
595020 the 20 percent deductible that they pay for doctor visits is affordable if you are talking about a primary care visit
595021 but if you have a lot of tests and treatment that can run up in the thousands of dollars
595022 this is a very real issue and as health care costs rise it will only get worse
595023 medicare has never covered all of beneficiaries health care costs and with the premiums and cost sharing the bill can add up
595024 we called upon our expertise in hollywood movie production and digital technology to build a machine that movie fans would truly love
595025 an advanced blu ray disc player like the bdp s350 or bdp s550 is a must for every hdtv owner because it delivers the best possible 1080p high definition video and incredible sound quality while unlocking next generation features that you just wont get from dvd downloads or video on demand
595026 weve smoked the tent for the last seven years we built our campfire underneath it to smoke it and thats why the tent doesnt leak
595027 we dont use any chemicals for waterproofing we do it all the old ways
595028 my dad was half cherokee and my grandma was full cherokee but ive never looked into getting enrolled as a tribal member
595029 but all this technology is killing morality and family values
595030 my grandmother was full blooded cherokee and we are descendants of the cherokee who went right through here during the trail of tears relocation to oklahoma
595031 in the 1820s and 1830s people were just going west they had opened up all this land and people said they could make a living out here but there was no water and they couldnt grow vegetables and they had to live off meat they hunted and if you made it past 20 to 30 years old you were an old man
595032 surjeet ji is not among us but his principles will always remain with us he was a great politician who has done a lot for the country
595033 we hope that we can continue to work for the development of the country along with those who believe in his thoughts
595034 comrade surjeet was a great freedom fighter and a great advocate of secularism
595035 he had a significant contribution to the formation of the upa government we all offer lal salam to surjeet who was the real angel for the poor and working class
595036 no doubt a great personality is not among us today but what he has done for the country and for the party can never be forgotten
595037 we expect to start our home loan business by march 2009 after getting all the necessary approvals
595038 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
595039 i think its an important risk but frankly im more concerned about bombs and guns which are easily available and can be very destructive
595040 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
595041 se a lei for aprovada significa um retrocesso e a retirada de direitos a gera es que portugal deve honrar
595042 ir manter uma atitude construtiva para evitar que os antigos combatentes percam direitos

595050 selain itu juga tidak menutup kemungkinan kita akan melakukan tes kebohongan terhadap ketiganya
595051 no one can tell you when the aquifer will dry up
595052 but the trend is telling us the water will not be accessible
595053 this is the least discussed problem but its the most important
595054 theres a little bit of water out there and the last drop of it will be the most valuable
595055 so theres every incentive out there to go and get it
595056 theyre very strong if they dont like the government they can overthrow it
595057 at the top you tend to have powerful people who do what they want the average farmer sees that example
595058 i think there are a lot of opportunities to collaborate and partner for a long time ahead
595059 half life of a dream contemporary chinese art from the logan collection
595060 a whole new generation is coming up with a new vision
595061 i do see in this new generation a new kind of art being made
595062 maybe not new to the world but certainly new to china the first wave was political pop more direct and obvious work im seeing a much more introspective emotional psychological sexual type of work people investigating themselves and their identity sun xun is asking identity questions about his country where it came from where its going and the worlds perceptions
595063 has revealed itself to be more psychologically resonant than the facade of pop iconoclasm and gestures of ironic detachment might readily suggest
595064 reenact the psychic aftermath of an era in which representations of specific human emotions were replaced with the idealized faces of the revolution
595065 as the culture changes you see the subject matter changing
595066 when i came back to l a from that trip i was just full of passion and fire
595067 i had to learn the language it was almost frenetic i didnt know why i was doing it i just had to when i came to los angeles 10 years ago i thought it was the wild west now china is the wild west i love it
595068 things are changing at a rapid pace there arent any rules in a way i lived in the 798 complex a former munitions factory converted into a sprawling art center for two months at a friends studio and i kept getting lost because the roads were changing now it looks like soho but if you are a foreigner you are in demand everyone wants to collaborate
595069 this time they destroyed our property if they come back im afraid they will target us
595070 activities that are not in accordance with interpretations of the religion of islam
595071 our state is a weak state that doesnt dare to enforce the law if it goes against the religious feeling of the majority
595072 the state has no right to say you may or may not worship
595073 right to worship according to their own religion or belief
595074 we call on muslims to fight ahmadiyah to kill ahmadiyah kill kill kill
595075 if they refuse to return to mainstream islam kill ahmadiyah clear them out of indonesia god is great
595076 the police didnt do anything when they burned down the mosque
595077 if we had taken action the riot would have worsened
595078 if ahmadiyah is the first one to be banned then other minority groups will be the next target
595079 the barren desert will flourish and the arid lands will bloom with greenery on both sides of the border
595080 they are now saying that private sector money can make this happen but that remains empty words
595081 the term of reference was signed three years ago that the canal would pass through the jordanian territories
595082 we want peace so much and we want to save the dead sea but this must be done in an intelligent way dont sell us dreams
595083 the pakistan government wants to show that we want to bring terror in our region to an end and that we want to work with the united states for that purpose
595084 but we also believe that there is more that the united states can do as well and that we have asked it to do
595085 they have agreed to take certain measures but it would not be appropriate to make them public so that the results could be achieved
595086 but we are discussing and have agreed to take certain actions to strengthen relations between the two countries and to fight the war against terrorism more successfully so our mutual objectives could be achieved
595087 theyre all going to have different suppliers different contracts different deals different marketing strategies locate in different retail areas
595088 we have a very strong full service clientele that has taken years to establish and that is what i feel has been our savior in this difficult time
595089 most gas stations make more off of a cup of coffee than they do off a gallon of gasoline
595090 stations with more goods and services can offer gas for less and use it as their loss leader
595091 if i dont have gas then theyll go there to get their 5 or whatever to get to town and then i lose out on their pop purchase
595092 if a station is on a really good corner that gets a lot of traffic they are able to purchase more gas and negotiate a better price
595093 were not going to them with anything that isnt needed
595094 were not talking about niceties like parks and pools these are things that the community needs
595095 we have had a change in our management structure and when you say youve promised things before well you havent been promised by us were living up to our plans
595096 he used to be so loving and attentive after he got back he was always tense he looked scared
595097 i knew right away when he got back from the war that something was wrong with him
595098 he used to be so loving and attentive after he got back he was always tense he looked scared
595099 if we tried to go anywhere the people and the noise would bother him so much that wed have to leave so we stopped going places
595100 its hard to re engage in civilian life and have the things that matter to your friends and family matter to you everything seems so trivial compared to the life and death of war
595101 a big part of being able to discuss their trauma has to do with the details of their shared experience the names of forward operating bases the challenges of living in extreme heat the threat of roadside bombs and car bombs
595102 are at a different stage of life just starting out with marriages and raising young children their concerns are more immediate controlling their behavior and being able to deal with anger and conflict
595103 i either couldnt feel anything or i would lose my temper and black out from rage
595104 i couldnt sleep i couldnt make decisions my wife and i couldnt get along
595105 finally it reached the breaking point and i had to do something
595106 but i couldnt relate to their experience because it was such a different war
595107 finding other vets from the same war is what helped me the most
595108 im closer with those guys now than with anybody else
595109 every time we had a patrol go out they always took small arms fire rocket propelled grenades hand grenades and there were a lot of ieds homemade bombs the military refers to as improvised explosive devices
595110 at the time you just have to shut everything down inside and keep going you have to do your mission with a clear mind or youre putting yourself and the people you work with in danger
595111 i would see people worried about breaking a nail or getting their car chipped totally missing the big picture of life not knowing that they could die at any instant
595112 i realized i wasnt really being a father to them
595113 hes a whole lot more outgoing and communicative its still a daily struggle but im slowly getting my husband back
595114 the threat of losing the funding mechanism is a real threat
595115 the more you bond upfront the less you have for the future
595116 keep saying we could have used that 77 million to balance the state budget
595117 a lot of people in phoenix signed onto this because they believed in him
595118 hes very credible the attitude about some of the council members is not the same
595119 by bonding you can accelerate the availability of the benefits
595120 we should definitely go out for as much money as we can
595121 i want to see a complete picture of what were planning to do downtown
595122 im not prepared to check out of the grocery store before we finish packing the cart
595123 we have to put a greater focus on revenue generating projects that has been noticeably absent so far
595124 the world began without the human race and it will end without it
595125 i am going to stop using birth control just letting you know
595126 your stalling on kids has me feeling bitter like you married me under false pretenses
595127 might get some type of injection in a couple of days
595128 the way jerry blevins is throwing and brad ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now
595129 i dont want to say that huston street is no longer the closer it might be more how well the other two guys are doing
595130 theres the very focused basketball kara thats the one you see with the monarchs and on espn
595131 then theres the funny silly kara she tells jokes and recites lines from tv shows she stops being so serious
595132 in our first meeting looking around the room and seeing everybody together for the first time lisa leslie tina thompson katie smith all the veterans that have been here before
595133 even though we all already made the team i was still nervous to get out here and get to work get started on this team journey that will hopefully end with a gold medal
595134 kara is a player i just love to work with
595135 shes a coachs dream shes a complete extension of me on the floor as a coach
595136 her energy her enthusiasm her passion for the game its contagious this team needs that kind of high energy from her
595137 karas been so busy with wnba basketball she hasnt had time to think much about the trip shes just been focusing on the monarchs then shell focus on the national team
595138 the plane tickets cost 2 000 a person rooms are 300 to 1 000 night
595139 its not cheap going to the olympics tickets for karas games arent a problem but anything else well probably have to try to get over there weve been shopping on craigslist but its very difficult
595140 this is the one thing karas wanted to do since she was really small
595141 were all really happy she gets to fulfill a dream shes always had
595142 it was the 1984 olympics and my dad sat me down in front of the tv
595143 my parents had explained to me that we were seeing history what the olympics meant and what it means to be an american i knew it was big
595144 then we watched evelyn ashford in the 100 meter finals i remember as she crossed the finish line the stadium was really loud i saw her emotions i remember the gold medal around her neck and the national anthem it all had a big impact on me
595145 when i saw that i decided i want to do that i want to win a gold medal
595146 i figured if i could outrun a car i could make the olympics
595147 our home was on a corner lot with a stop sign in alexandria va
595148 we would watch kara from the window she would take off down the sidewalk as soon as a car pulled up
595149 once i tried everything i found basketball is what i like the most she said
595150 i fell in love with the game i liked it more than any sport i played except football but dad wouldnt let me play against the boys after age 9 he was worried id get hurt
595151 its a combination of her intelligence and her capacity to learn you cant beat her work ethic and commitment she has a special quality you just cant teach
595152 because of my usa commitments i could only do so much this past season
595153 im excited we get to watch her on tv while we work on getting better well be ready for her when she gets back
595154 you snooze you lose maybe billy beane can trade another series team away
595155 i love the 49ers but man alex smith is a bust and mike nolan stinks
595156 sometimes its hard for some to be that girly girl while wanting to compete ladies get caught up in that strength thing and thats ok as long you can be yourself you can be aggressive on the floor and still be a lady off the floor
595157 especially when theres a runner at second and im more toward home plate i flinch on contact you just dont know
595158 they are like a javelin coming at you a spear
595159 i think theyre going to get rid of them i really do
595160 i didnt like the way maple sounded i see it exploding all the time i grew up with ash and ive stayed with ash
595161 theres got to be an alternative to ash but maples just not it those things are exploding and its dangerous its a serious situation
595162 i dont care which wood they use i wouldnt mind if they go back to ash
595163 i use maple because thats just what all the bat companies have in stock and what they can get me the fastest and thats maple
595164 i loved you in the morning our kisses deep and warm
595165 bring back unreal bring back the skaarj and those bizarre innocent nali we use to love killing for no reason and offer the classic unreal game as an unlockable feature
595166 the u s government never discusses the specific security clearance of an individual employee or military member
595167 time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
595168 a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions and plans
595169 i dont believe that reviewing a persons medical record is part of a typical security investigation unless there is an indication that theres a concern there
595170 and the alternative here is to have a much higher level of scrutiny for everybody in the system i dont particularly want investigators going through my medical records if theres not a reason a security related reason to do that
595171 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
595172 to now be able to prosecute him for the murders
595173 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
595174 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
595175 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him
595176 stella keep going its me hes after mom and dad are already on the other side of the mirror now get going
595177 ive seen her interact with teachers all across the state asking them what they need most how can she be most helpful to them
595178 we need a fresh look at the wasl and shes not willing to do that
595179 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
595180 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
595181 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
595182 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
595183 also regrettable but i dont think china is regressing the way that russia is we have a greater opportunity to work in a cooperative way with china
595184 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
595185 ask however many times you wish the answer will always be no
595186 this was the first american wine to win in a french wine tasting
595187 i had read about that tasting but i didnt realize it was being turned into a movie we wanted to come here because everyone says its supposed to be really pretty
595188 we definitely expect our chardonnay to be hard to find once the movie comes out
595189 we hope that we can continue to work for the development of the country along with those who believe in his thoughts
595190 comrade surjeet was a great freedom fighter and a great advocate of secularism
595191 he had a significant contribution to the formation of the upa government we all offer lal salam to surjeet who was the real angel for the poor and working class
595192 no doubt a great personality is not among us today but what he has done for the country and for the party can never be forgotten

595254 itll be like that for about the first week you wont really do anything
595255 yeah but after the first week things pick up pretty fast
595256 you need to learn how to communicate with your zanpakuto this will help you and most likely save your lives you probably wont achieve that this year
595257 you know personal training at her stage of training isnt allowed unless yamamoto san asks
595258 most of them are having trouble and a lot of the captains have been asked to do a couple of training sessions with the students and here look
595259 wow they really must be having trouble this year i guess ill go because were doing this for the first year students
595260 hisagi san i didnt see you there what are you doing
595261 it was so much easier when there are experienced people explaining everything i was so glad to find i was paired up with hisagi
595262 not bad but they have a lot of work to do you
595263 he let his guard down and i sucker punched him in the stomach
595264 the captains dont come until half the year is over and we never get to train with them
595265 it was a good thing it happened otherwise we would have been sitting there doing nothing
595266 true but tomorrow should be boring i mean they cant come everyday
595267 did you see the look on face he looked pissed
595268 lets go visit hisagi we havent seen him in a while except for that sparring match today
595269 you know what i want and im not going to stop until i get it
595270 thanks to you i have to go and get out of these wet cloths
595271 so is there anything going on between you and hisagi
595272 i mean youre always together he skips out on work to go see you he helps you with school you havent even been here long and hes hanging all over you it just seems like theres something going on
595273 well theres nothing going on he was the first person i met here so i guess ive kinda taken a liking to him like a brother sort of thing you know
595274 what time is it and whats got you in such a playful mood
595275 well its quarter after 4 and i have no idea
595276 well ive been working all day i had to get up that the hardest part of the day then i had to do paper work train you come home and do more paper work this is a good break for me
595277 its hitsugaya he says he has an important message for the both of you
595278 alright give me a bit to wake jushiro up and get dressed
595279 well then stay while i get ready the girls will keep you company
595280 we have a problem aizen has been spotted again but we cannot do anything until he attacks i want you all to keep your eyes open your dismissed
595281 how can i keep my eyes open when i havent had enough sleep to do so
595282 im sorry hitsugaya taicho maya chan just doesnt know when she should be quiet
595283 dont you think its odd that were going to this meeting while everyone else is going elsewhere
595284 yes you missed the meeting but no you didnt miss much we were told that aizen had been spotted and that we need to keep our eyes open incase he decides to attack us
595285 now excuse me id like to go back to bed
595286 i dont know what it is maybe something bad is going to happen
595287 well if you want a fight then a fight youll have but im taking her with me either way
595288 nothing yet jushiro should be able to handle it but if he cant thats what were here for
595289 not yet right now we have a higher chance of hitting our own allies then hitting aizen but be careful just because he isnt fighting with us doesnt mean he wont attack us he uses mind manipulation to fight to so dont believe everything you see
595290 give me the girl and maybe ill let you live
595291 jushiro taicho is a little busy right now he should be here any moment
595292 the last thing i remember was seeing aizen there in front of me but when i tried to attack i blacked out
595293 he took off as soon as we started getting the upper hand
595294 right now you need to be careful hes after you
595295 im not leaving you as an open target for him i refuse to loose you
595296 i know why you have visions and i have a plan to get aizen out of hiding but jushiro isnt going to be happy
595297 youre a seer and its very rare to have those gifts and as for aizen youre going to have to be bait
595298 youre going to be there with me so why not
595299 we could always let him live and then live in fear ourselves besides its me hes after
595300 what a beautiful thing she is too bad youre not going to get to have that wedding of yours
595301 it doesnt matter how long it takes i will have you
595302 tsumori was kidnaped by aizen and i couldnt do anything but watch
595303 its not your fault you couldnt do anything about it i mean if the captains cant do it then you probably cant either plus i bet something good came out of it
595304 why didnt you just tell me at the beginning you couldve had me then
595305 tali if you feel so bad about why dont you go and save her
595306 because that would be suicide you know im not that powerful
595307 i didnt mean go alone ask some of the captains and stuff im sure theyll help you out
595308 like they would they would probably just give me a speech on how its a foolhardy idea and that i should just return to my room and let the captains deal with it
595309 and just what are you going to do about it
595310 aizen attacked again and took tsumori i just stood there and watched helpless
595311 the captains wont rush into this like you will they will just say its pointless when they dont know where she is or the area in which wed be in plus they wouldnt bring me along im still an academy student remember
595312 i know and going to get her right now would be suicide were having a meeting in 20 minutes to decide what were going to do
595313 so the hollows were a distraction and its more then likely that theres going to be a lot more over there
595314 ill give you two more news when i find out whats going on
595315 well theres a cure for this grab her were making a trip to the living world
595316 you cant just run into these things you need to think through them before jumping in or youre going to get yourself killed
595317 maybe this will teach you not to pull that little escapade off again
595318 we have some good news we can go and get tsumori right now shes in the living world so i have a job for all of you jushiro you hisagi and byakuya are going to go and get her everyone else is going after aizen
595319 jushiro bayakuya and i are to go to the human realm to save tsumori im supposed to head to the gate right now
595320 so im not coming and i loose my best friend for a while
595321 just promise me you wont go and get yourself killed
595322 take her back and get something done about her hands
595323 we need to get back there i know what hes capable of and hell kill both of them
595324 if you really want to go then ill carry your zanpakuto
595325 1 after you kill me hunt ulquiorra down and kill him
595326 it went well we killed aizen and tsumori is back at home
595327 you can come in if you want to wait while i take a quick shower
595328 its just i didnt think youd get over it that fast
595329 yes well ive been training and it gives me lots of time to think
595330 yes with kinzotsume i can use my shikai now so never again will i stand there useless
595331 kinzotsume told me that in a few weeks i should achieve bankai
595332 thats fine im sore but alive so dont worry about it
595333 sorry but i have to get to a meeting with yamamoto san supposedly he wants to know what went on
595334 its nice to see that you made it home where are you going
595335 he is a large wolf large enough for me to ride on with blue fur he has violet angel like wings sprouting from his back
595336 you want to stay and watch me pick my new recruits
595337 yeah well you need people with strong stomachs i need people who can block a punch

595351 tb can happen to anybody no one is immune to it and basically what we need for the community to know is that anyone out there has coughed for more than three weeks fever and loss of appetite or feel sick they really need to see their doctor right away and get themselves checked
595352 the thing we want to emphasize that these people were not treated adequately so if you have the symptoms of tb its very important that you seek medical care either your medical doctor or public health if the disease is identified and treated then patient will recover but if you stay home and ignore it the chances are you may not recover from the disease

595516 the plot is suspenseful and fluidly told but the evolving bond between master and servant is at the heart of this excellent first work as downie carefully details the pained conscience of the former and the latters sorrow that both her family and her country have been ravaged highly recommended
595517 the highest praise i can offer this wonderfully entertaining portrait of the roman empire at its most far flung is that i hope downie is planning a series ruso is too good a character for just one book
595518 a strong start for downie whose series joins those by lindsay davis and stephen saylor on the ancient rome beat but adds a bit more humor to the mix of period detail and suspense

595537 the question of how writers come to appropriate the lives of the people they write about is a tricky one
595538 while it is facile to equate journalism with lying it is also true that both actions share in common an unpleasantly instrumental approach to people and to language that diminishes the common store of trust the subject has no power to alter a reporters approach to his or her subject or to take back a single word that they said
595539 every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible he is a kind of confidence man preying on peoples vanity ignorance or loneliness gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse

595588 so were telling one big story in season 3 and putting the torchwood crew under a huge amount of pressure and just seeing how they cope with their numbers depleted
595589 it was a really difficult decision behind the scenes because we love them as people we love having them around and they were great characters you cant keep doing that where the team doesnt die week after week after week year after year youve got to show what the stakes are
595590 i have to say when i was told about the storyline i kind of agreed
595591 obviously i was kind of sad and sort of depressed in that sense about im going to miss everyone and the character but i think with her i think she really came full circle and she went through so much and it felt just right

595602 there was once a great lord who declared his heir would be the person found to have a certain precious ring of his and drawing near to his death he had two other rings similar to the first one made since he had three sons and he gave a ring to each son each one of them thought himself to be the heir and to have the true ring but because of their similarity it could not be known with certainty likewise god the father has various children whom he loves such as christians turks and jews and to each of them he has given the will to live by his own law and we do not know which is the right one

595621 the discussion with wide receivers roy williams and calvin johnson but kitna knows its a conversation that likely will last throughout the regular season
595622 if you get this defense you throw it here kitna said
595623 the receivers might have the same route and i have to choose who im going to throw to kitna said
595624 weve already discussed that i know its coming and its inevitable
595625 i told them i know its coming they laughed and said yeah we know its coming too
595626 thats the great thing we have going on communication mike wanted to handle all that but now were talking about things and how we can make things better i love it
595627 the best thing is that it helps us with is the receivers theyre doing what theyre comfortable with the communication is wide open right now

595636 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
595637 senator obama doesnt agree with the lyrics but that beat is fiiiirreee
595638 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
595639 higher taxes and more foreign oil thats the real obama
595640 the reality is senator obama is a celebrity the likes of which we havent seen in the political arena certainly in my lifetime so i think you must start in every discussion by acknowledging reality and by pointing out that in this election you cant just inspire people with your words or your crowds or your images or your photos but you must inspire them with your deeds and with your vision and so thats the gap that we see opening up and that were pretty excited and motivated by

595723 the outrageous decision of four activist supreme court judges who overturned the will of the people
595724 while gays have the right to their private lives they do not have the right to redefine marriage for everyone else

595743 sekarang ni keadaan isteri saya dah bertambah teruk bila malam saja dia meraung meracau dan menangis nangis jadi saya harap ustaz dapatlah tolong serba sedikit sebab dah habis ikhtiar saya mengubatnya cara moden
595744 macam macam ustaz tapi ada waktunya dia minta ampun maaf daripada saya saya tanya kenapa dia tak cakap cuma minta maaf saja yalah orang dah sakit memang macam tu
595745 dia baring dalam bilik ni ustaz jangan terkejut pula tengok muka dia orang rumah saya ni sensitif sikit
595746 pin saya nak tanya sikit tapi sebelum tu minta maaflah kalau nanti awak tersinggung
595747 sejak dua tiga malam lepas dia minta ampun daripada saya dan ceritakan segala galanya
595748 malam itu saya terkejut sebab semasa meracau isteri saya minta ampun kerana telah mengenakan ilmu kotor kepada saya
595749 kenapa dia jawab supaya ikut kata katanya dan tak cari perempuan lain tambah saya kesal selepas itu dia meminta ampun pula kerana telah berlaku curang kepada saya kata niza dia lakukan perbuatan tu selepas saya ditundukkan dengan ilmu hitam
595750 dia dah derhaka dengan saya buat tak senonoh dengan lelaki lain kenakan ilmu sihir kepada saya ustaz mau saya maafkan dia
595751 ya dia pergi dengan aman dan awak pula dapat pahala
595752 takkan awak nak biarkan dia menderita awak nak pukul dia maki dia tak ada gunanya maafkan saja dia dengan hati yang benar benar ikhlas
595753 tapi alhamdulillah sebelum pergi dia sempat minta ampun daripada saya sekali lagi kerana menderhaka marah memang marah tapi bila dia pegang tangan saya sambil menangis dan kemudian minta ampun tidak sanggup juga rasanya untuk membiarkan dia pergi dalam keadaan tanpa kemaafan daripada saya ustaz saya dah ampunkan dia

595773 this sort of outbreak is a very difficult thing to manage
595774 weve been working every day with this clinic to make sure that firstly the staff are as safe as we can make them that the spread of this virus is contained

595779 we figure that freedom of the press is only important if its offensive
595780 if were not gonna offend anybody we dont need protection of the first amendment
595781 whats good for general motors is good for the country
595782 i dream i am at the top of a soft hill and i start running to the bottom of the hill and in slow motion i slowly become a bird i glide around and its a very pleasurable dream
595783 i did stop a few times and i even sat down and observed down the plaza was empty because it was still under construction i saw some people looking up after a while a gigantic crowd
595784 gliding about me looking at me as if to say what is this guy doing here
595785 to reach the clouds my high wire walk between the twin towers
595786 i a bird gliding back and forth between the canyons rims did not count the voyages nor did i care to record the passing of time
595787 but then i aborted making a film of the adventure while i was doing it
595788 i had to choose to hide in the tower the night before a movie crew following me would have been impossible
595789 i didnt want to just sign get rich and hope the movie would be faithful to my story
595790 a little path of six or seven little ropes assembled together with some kind of coat hanger wire to make it like a flat plank of rope i would go with the widest shoes i would find completely ridiculous and absurd but that was my logic at the time the biggest shoes and the biggest ropes i could find one day i take one rope out and one rope out and one day walking only on one rope
595791 it is like the motor of my walking on the wire
595792 i have to understand what the wire is and discover that the wire is alive and marry myself with the life of the wire in order to be walking beautifully and successfully on the wire
595793 the degree of exposure of my character was daunting but i felt secure enough in my own life to do it
595794 his journey this very articulate terror of intimacy really appealed to me
595795 a parable for men and women dont give up because theres a very strong possibility that the intimate relationship is out there for you
595796 her eye for symmetry and balance she seems to have an awareness of patterns in human behavior and i tend to look for those patterns
595797 when it didnt happen back then for me it was a little like out of sight out of mind but she was the champion of the picture when it resurfaced in 2007 i had a wonderful agent who said i think this is a wonderful project i think you should attach yourself to it penelope and i were invited to put forth ideas about directors and we were in agreement on isabel
595798 i become the child and the boy becomes the adult
595799 locked into childhood who surrounds himself with children not in a sinister way but because he needs to be a child himself he was very persecuted and im sure he thought of himself as providing a way for kids to make a living
595800 it was about a man completely at the mercy of his wife and best friend i also think i did it because it was a lovely opportunity to work with harold who is the quintessential modern writer
595801 working with writers first then with directors from the ground up
595802 you know what this is where ive got to be
595803 yes im going to get married because of this show

595816 i dare you just imagine the bad karma of even tapping a cow
595817 our husbands used to resist us and yell and scream when we tried to come to the meetings
595818 theyre dropping us off and picking us up they respect us now because we are making money for our families
595819 every woman must live live not dependently but live independently and when she stands for herself she must realize that she has the strength of thousands of women standing behind her
595820 i woke up this morning with a deep aching inside
595821 if this one thing just happens ill be good i will have found my way
595822 if only i had patience i wouldnt feel so crazy
595823 thats the point of life we are always arriving at new levels of understanding and patience if we all had patience right now life would be over there is always something to come next to look ahead towards when that goes away what do we have

595829 what gets spoken in the wednesday club stays in the wednesday club
595830 hello worlds this is my 1st time to publishing myblogs
595831 look down that last aisle that is where the car stuff is
595832 we knew something was wrong and we just worked twice as hard to help him
595833 we are not here to impress people we are here to feed people trust me i will guide you through
595834 the concrete dragon chinas urban revolution and what it means for the world
595835 they were effectively field tested far from the center of power
595836 the last days of old beijing life in the vanishing backstreets of a city transformed
595837 it was brushed on condemned homes in ghostly white strokes and circled
595838 it just appeared overnight like a gang tag or the work of a specter the hand
595839 lost on planet china the strange and true story of one mans attempt to understand the worlds most mystifying nation
595840 but people have been lulled by tv images of politicians saying were going to help
595841 its just not true before there were bigger safety nets and now those are gone
595842 we had some cracks in the ceiling and some things on the floor nothing prepared us for the violence of this
595843 the first time in 35 years he went anywhere without me
595844 i think there are a lot of opportunities to collaborate and partner for a long time ahead
595845 half life of a dream contemporary chinese art from the logan collection
595846 a whole new generation is coming up with a new vision
595847 i do see in this new generation a new kind of art being made
595848 maybe not new to the world but certainly new to china the first wave was political pop more direct and obvious work im seeing a much more introspective emotional psychological sexual type of work people investigating themselves and their identity sun xun is asking identity questions about his country where it came from where its going and the worlds perceptions
595849 has revealed itself to be more psychologically resonant than the facade of pop iconoclasm and gestures of ironic detachment might readily suggest
595850 reenact the psychic aftermath of an era in which representations of specific human emotions were replaced with the idealized faces of the revolution
595851 as the culture changes you see the subject matter changing
595852 when i came back to l a from that trip i was just full of passion and fire
595853 i had to learn the language it was almost frenetic i didnt know why i was doing it i just had to when i came to los angeles 10 years ago i thought it was the wild west now china is the wild west i love it
595854 things are changing at a rapid pace there arent any rules in a way i lived in the 798 complex a former munitions factory converted into a sprawling art center for two months at a friends studio and i kept getting lost because the roads were changing now it looks like soho but if you are a foreigner you are in demand everyone wants to collaborate
595855 it is not to barack obamas advantage to make this a big issue
595856 it is simply not acceptable to the majority of people including many of those who may be sympathetic
595857 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
595858 barack obama has played the race card from the bottom of the deck
595859 race plays a role in american politics in a lot of different ways its not just ku klux klan style racism
595860 when a large number of african americans decide to support barack obama on the assumption hed be a better vehicle for pursuing their interests thats taking race into consideration
595861 its simple these are three of the biggest celebrities in the world thats why they were chosen
595862 one of obamas big problems is that hes black and he does have a funny name
595863 the main thing about roosevelts appeal is hes remembered by most people as an image and a style
595864 sooner or later just about every republican who runs for president will invoke t r
595865 usually though they dont know what theyre talking about mccain is more serious about it i think hes got more justification
595866 a mccain white house will reflect the guiding principles of theodore roosevelt americas foremost conservation president
595867 john has shown immense amounts of courage that are certainly in the tradition of the old lion
595868 some critics in his day and ours saw in roosevelts patriotism only flag waving chauvinism not all that dissimilar to old world allegiances that incited one people to subjugate another and plunged whole continents into war
595869 but they did not see the universality of the ideals that formed his creed
595870 i am totally relieved this brings a lot of closure
595871 it may not have brought the closure that others may have wanted to see this person face justice as opposed to take his own life but i think they have the right person
595872 he fits the profile that we had advanced but they would like to see the evidence
595873 the family definitely wants to be able to see the evidence that the fbi has accumulated that theyre not just trying to make this guy a scapegoat allowing them to close their file and be done with it
595874 so we gather the facts and then we ponder the facts and we just wait and see what develops
595875 my head and my heart says that saying anything detrimental unkind toward this man only hurts his family because theyre the ones left to sort through and to wade through all of this
595876 we have to remember they lost someone they loved also
595877 those are the only times when i consider the fact that this is not normal
595878 this is not the type of person i was seven years ago
595879 a lot of leaders of this community enjoy the benefits that the naacp made it possible for them to have but they are not members
595880 how can you forget the organization that helped you get where you are
595881 i told myself when i get to be a man ill live here
595882 im sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
595883 i aint got no matches but i got a long ways to go
595884 the whole state breathed a sigh of relief when he became president of this university because they knew it was in good hands
595885 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
595886 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
595887 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
595888 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
595889 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
595890 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
595891 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
595892 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
595893 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
595894 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
595895 are you gonna talk or do i have to hang up on you
595896 you remember last night wait dont explode on me i know youre still mad i mean remember the newscast
595897 yeah i remember it you mean that dangerous animal warning i cant tell what youre getting into
595898 you know its still running around out there and walking home last night for me was pretty scary i kept feeling like something was following me like stalking me and stuff
595899 nate are you just calling me to tell me that youre afraid of the dark
595900 well what i mean is do you want to prove him wrong
595901 heck yeah i would the boy deserves to eat his own foul words you have no idea what id do to prove that hes not the hotshot he thinks he is
595902 but i do know that sometimes what he says isnt entirely true or right which brings me to the point of my phone
595903 i think we should go into the woods and find out what the animal really is
595904 well i did say id do anything to prove him wrong
595905 okay fine ill go on your little forest adventure meet me at my house in an hour we can go into the woods from my backyard
595906 yeah she figured i was going to be late so she wanted to meet me halfway but i came here from the woods so we missed each other
595907 well have enough light theres nothing to be scared of
595908 oh nothing really my parents theyre not on the best of terms with each other
595909 no i would have called you but you just seemed to hate all of us
595910 it was different before like youd never known us at all it was almost like when you looked at me or charlie or any of us you were wishing we were all dead
595911 any other day i would have beat myself silly for saying this
595912 but i can honestly say that i believe that thing was a werewolf if thats not whats scaring the people around here i dont know what it is
595913 its the best guess i can come up with i mean did you see the face on that thing sure the stories about them dont fit in very well with our situation but still
595914 i only said that yesterday night because the movie scared me you know i didnt think it was possible
595915 yeah but its not as satisfying as i thought it would be
595916 that was so scary i dont think ill feel safe in my own house anymore
595917 but i feel safe in the sunlight out here its almost like the whole thing never happened
595918 its probably just the adrenaline once it wears off well be terrified out of our skins again but for now im enjoying the break
595919 sleeping heh i didnt mean to but i was waiting for you to get home
595920 what are you talking about you told me to come to your house today i was early getting here so i figured id wait because you werent home whats so bad about that
595921 my mistake i forgot to call you and tell you not to come i had to go out for awhile and i forgot my cell phone and suffered some minor setbacks
595922 i got here at 7 30 fifteen minutes before you asked me to be here what time is it now
595923 12 30 ive been asleep for five hours on your front porch
595924 what did i do to you to make you so bitter to me i didnt have to come today but i did because im your friend friends dont treat each other the way youre treating me
595925 chana youre not making any sense you never hurt me im fine i forgive you
595926 tell me whats wrong i can help you if its trouble at school or with your friends just tell me ill listen
595927 you can trust me i wont tell jackie or nate or anyone if its a personal problem this is between you and me now tell me
595928 life offers no bad or unfair things no foul luck
595929 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world
595930 however we dont exclude that on the 8th of august there might be periodic rain
595931 its a balancing act with the pressure the fire and the water
595932 they just kind of have a heart and soul to them
595933 they all kind of have their different attitudes some will cooperate and some are just a royal pain in the butt but when it comes alive with the heat of it and the warmth and all of the clicks and bangs there is nothing better
595934 that baby just went crazy and he started laughing and kicking and throwing his arms around
595935 since he loves it so much why not get into it
595936 its hard to find a girl in this day and age that is willing to go to these events let alone be willing to marry a guy that is into it
595937 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
595938 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
595939 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
595940 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
595941 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
595942 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
595943 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
595944 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
595945 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
595946 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
595947 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
595948 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
595949 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
595950 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
595951 novo asni brezpla niki ki jim je dr avna ptt odbrala

595959 where are the bloggers of color and why arent we reading them
595960 i want to tell her she did a good job in the election and i wanted her to be president
595961 i want hillary to win because do you see any girls here
595962 he just cant be president because it would just be more of the same failed policies of the last eight years
595963 thats not going to happen and im not going to speculate on that
595964 the real test is not what happens in the campaign but what happens in the white house if you think the campaign is hard just wait until you get to the white house
595965 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
595966 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
595967 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
595968 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
595969 where are the bloggers of color and why arent we reading them
595970 cleaning the garbage cans the oil stains them yellow and we could never get rid of it no matter what we tried
595971 theres an aggravated assault that happened to baldwin so the case will be followed up
595972 its probably too early to tell what if any disciplinary action might be happening until he determines what the facts are
595973 regardless of what time of year it is or what expectations are or arent any time you have student athletes in any sport involved in any sort of altercation is unfortunate and is something that you never like to see
595974 your av had a real hang up about culling the herd
595975 wed tell him it was time to retire a cow from the milk barn and take her to the cattle auction but hed always resist id point out that she wasnt earning her keep wasnt pulling her weight but he never wanted to hear that
595976 as long as a cow was contributing a little milk every day your av would just say that every little bit helped a few drops and he was happy as far as he was concerned that was enough i guess he didnt like to think in terms of return on investment
595977 we know we need more water but environmentalists are stopping us from getting it fish are not as important as people every river in california should have a dam on it
595978 yes every single one if we want to have plenty of water we have to stop it from running downstream and into the ocean
595979 uh dad theyve actually demolished a few dams in recent years because they were no longer economically feasible or environmentally acceptable
595980 ambush marketing is the name given by an event proprietor to any marketing campaign which takes place around the event but does not involve payment of a sponsorship fee to the event
595981 om het lichtende voorbeeld van heineken er dan toch maar bij te pakken
595982 the recent discovery history of the region combined with our view that the outlook for the uranium industry is very positive has shaped our decision to float caliburn as a focused exploration company with the potential to deliver new significant discoveries in these exciting regions
595983 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit
595984 our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health our keynote speaker dr a k susheela executive director fluorosis research and rural development foundation india probably knows more about fluorides toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist it is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say
595985 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
595986 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
595987 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation
595988 it makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers milk

596001 think about who is in thurston county a lot of them are employees of state government i think they will tell you i have asked a lot of them but i have clearly treated them with respect
596002 bad mouths state employees all the time wrong message for the work force you are to lead they are dedicated they are hard working people theyve got families like anybody else and they need to be treated with respect
596003 the leadership style i want to bring to this is really centered on customer service
596004 im going to need the help of state employees once i get there were going to have a clear mission to turn this into an entrepreneurial state

596006 along the way ray showed the emanuel children how various pinball playfield mechanisms work by giving them a pinball to strike against bumpers and drop targets the children were ecstatic
596007 we appreciate all the manufacturers and customers who joined us to celebrate betsons new facility
596008 i would like to thank everyone who took time out of their busy schedule to attend our open house
596009 it was more or less a warning to not get involved with the athletes until after the olympics
596010 they sent me an email saying we have always had good cooperation and thanks for everything you do for the ethiopian athletes but lately there has been tension within the team it was a request to keep a low profile
596011 we have to decide on one central and basic position and that is that we cooperate and want to help the pragmatic forces among the palestinians those who want to negotiate with us and who are fighting the radical islam of hamas those who oppose terrorism
596012 we are sending a message that no one is above the law and that no family is above the law gaza will enjoy peace and security
596013 our position on principle is that we work with and aid those among the palestinians who struggle against radical islam who oppose terrorism and who favour negotiations
596014 this is why we take this position when these palestinians are in distress and asking to go to abbass headquarters in ramallah where they will participate in the struggle against hamas
596015 i was traded over here in 2006 and played the last two months in the big leagues
596016 i started on opening day last year but i didnt play well right out of the chute i was on the disabled list twice it was just a bad year
596017 as a player all you can ask for is an opportunity
596018 coming over here gave me an opportunity but i didnt make the most of it last year i feel good and i hope ill get another chance with the royals the big key for me is staying healthy when im healthy everything else works out
596019 i know that atkins is going to hit no matter where he plays in the field

596021 you can tell it was a tough trade when you have buyers remorse the one for nady and marte hurt
596022 for me my kids are getting older it wasnt about being close to home it was chance to win a title that was the draw
596023 both agents and brokers need to revisit their unique selling proposition and redefine what it is they do to create value what they did last year and last month is no longer of value to consumers and is viewed as a commodity consumers are now better informed and have access to the same data that agents do access to data is not a value proposition anymore helping consumers to understand and utilize the overabundance of data is a value proposition the industry needs to reinvent the value it delivers to a new breed of hyper informed consumers who want a higher level of value than is being delivered today
596024 for this area i dont think we the industry are doing a good enough job with pricing its a little less challenging now because new sellers understand that the market is different now and are not insisting on the price appreciation their neighbor may had seen a couple of years ago
596025 still its important to look at how comparable homes are sold a week ago looking back six months or more wont cut it for most homes
596026 agents will have to go beyond the computer software programs looking at whats happening in neighborhoods
596027 i think well see some of the smaller offices either close or merge with other companies especially if sales remain slow for an extended period of time

596093 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
596094 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas

596216 through my friend deepak chopra i came across oshos books which gave me another deeper shift in my life i regret i did not meet him in person and i feel sorry the us government missed such an opportunity back in 86
596217 i was inspired by oshos wisdom when i wrote the song how fragile we are reading his books gave me hope for humanity it is a must for everybody to have a look into his words
596218 in the east music has been always used as a support for meditation
596219 none of this negative stuff though you wont see it come out of our side at all
596220 none of the negative stuff will come out of your side
596221 my husband is absolutely opposed to any negative campaigning at all
596222 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter
596223 the straight talk express has taken a nasty turn into the gutter sen john mccain has resorted to lies and distortions in what sounds like an increasingly desperate attempt to slow down sen barack obama by raising questions about his patriotism instead of taking the democrat down a few notches these baseless attacks are raising more questions about the republicans campaign and his ability to control his temper the most offensive line comes from mccain himself the arizona senator has repeated that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign that is one of the more outrageous statements by a major political party candidate seeking the presidency
596224 even some mccain allies have winced at the paris britney spot
596225 well that certainly didnt take long on july 3 news reports said senator john mccain worried that he might lose the election before it truly started opened his doors to disciples of karl rove from the 2004 campaign and the bush white house less than a month later the results are on full display the candidate who started out talking about high minded civil debate has wholeheartedly adopted mr roves low minded and uncivil playbook
596226 even by the elastic standards of political ads this is more than a stretch its baloney its also a marker on the path toward the kind of simplistic counterproductive demonizing that many expect will poison the fall campaign
596227 mccains new ad claims that obama says hell raise taxes on electricity
596228 in conjunction with its partner in the project international finance corporation rio tinto is currently studying the issues raised in the correspondence
596229 rio tinto remains confident that its arrangements are in all respects in conformity with guinean laws and that it has complied with its obligations
596230 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world
596231 a splendid performance at the olympics opening ceremony is of major importance
596232 however we dont exclude that on the 8th of august there might be periodic rain
596233 what i dont understand why do we have to go to a stupid public school for im to old for school
596234 oh calm down blake its not all bad we went to school before you know
596235 we have to go to the human school if not people well get a bit nosey in wondering why a house full of teenagers are leavening on there own and not at school wouldnt they
596236 but i dont care what they think i dont want to go its boring
596237 your going to that school like it or not im not going to have you act this way any longer you say your to old then why dont you acted it your what 289 now and you still act like a yearling vampire
596238 they never did get along that well if it had dent been for kiras and megans love for him he would of killed him already alex thought the same thing only he just didnt wont to kill kiras older brother
596239 jay just found megan this morning she had one of her fits again the day before kira said he found her in the middle of town stalking a couple near the bank he had to drag her back home and put her to bed so there resting now they should be down latter though
596240 dear god jay you look like hell didnt you get any sleep

596243 okay said kira pulling out a thick red folder we are now enrolled at eastern now here are your classes
596244 god for how long do we have to stay here for
596245 at lest for 2 years or even just one i dont know really
596246 alright then so we leave in the morning around seven then
596247 if i where you id go out and feed to night or just drink a lot of blood wine from the freezer
596248 im going to go room and sleep ill drink in the morning
596249 alright and alex you need a bath you smell like a dead animal
596250 shut up i when i got your damn latter the other day i didnt have time to clean up
596251 those guys know what theyre doing theyre my security blanket and then there are the receivers the tight ends and the running backs and the coaches too
596252 its all in place now we just have to go out and execute we have to work on the little things we have to get better
596253 we know the talent we have we have expectations to win every game
596254 max expects to throw a touchdown pass every time out
596255 i like it when it bothers him when hes not perfect on the field
596256 hes poised and he has tons of confidence theres no question everybody sees that everybody feels that you take that out on the field especially on the road and it makes it much easier to win
596257 im comfortable and relaxed but i have to get better
596258 there are so many things i have to work on were good but we have a big target on us every week were going to have to come to play i wouldnt have it any other way
596259 im calm but i have a sense of urgency im the exact same on the field as i was last year im competitive im driven i expect to improve and im hungry to win
596260 it was fun to be here in front of my home crowd being the only utah guy
596261 i had a lot of support and i appreciate all the help
596262 i felt like i was being pushed so i jumped
596263 it is always better to do things on your own terms
596264 were facing a lot of tough issues right now that kind of call became too much to ignore
596265 the proposition is supported by the governor and the legislature is trying to slap her down
596266 it complements the rest of the memorial which was more abstract and poetic
596267 not everybody is happy but i think the approach is a sound one
596268 when the atmosphere on the ninth floor the governors office is more receptive to a bill like this i think the votes are there
596269 we met the worst of humanity with the best of humanity
596270 the arizona 9 11 memorial is established to honor the memories of those who lost their lives in one of this nations most horrific tragedies to those who kept their spirit alive through unity and sacrifice and to serve as a meaningful place for families to reflect upon these events for generations to come
596271 either an upgrading of the lanes or a return to normal operation is in order
596272 if there were an inability to upgrade the signage we feel that a most popular option would be to return the lanes to normal operation rather than keep them as is
596273 i support the conclusion that the lanes should be eliminated
596274 open swim attendance is down by 34 337 visitors which is most likely due to the pool closures
596275 but even then you always need a study buddy and sharing a book has never been a problem for me
596276 we delayed another week because it smelled like smoke in the restaurant
596277 more than anybody wants to admit this is a real estate driven market
596278 i think its a lot higher than it has been in the past
596279 if theyre not on the rolls theyre not on the rolls
596280 we try to tell the petition gatherers please get the registration forms to us as quickly as possible
596281 the explanation is there was so much demand put upon the petition circulating community that the quality went down
596282 school districts can pay folks a fair and livable wage but then its going to cost them in materials and class size
596283 its like asking me if i want to pay for groceries or my mortgage
596284 its all a numbers game theyve infused large amounts of resources behind their sports program
596285 theyve hired the worlds best coaches to come in and coach their coaches for future generations
596286 never has a society attached so much ambition so much desire for identity to the olympics as the chinese
596287 its going to be very hard for american athletes to hold back the tide most americans dont have a clue thats about to happen they think basketball star yao ming is some kind of anomaly and dont understand he is representative of the largest talent pool the drama is going to take a lot of americans enormously by surprise
596288 the difference between the competition phelps faces and the competition spitz faced is like the difference between trying out for the junior high football team and the nfl
596289 i think its really going to be good for downtown
596290 its a made by me exhibition not made by my aunt or someone in china
596291 i will try to please everybody every single american in any remarks that i might give but i intend to address the substance of the issues
596292 move around and engage the audience he can work off some notes thats not a problem but he shouldnt try to give the same speech in the same format as obama
596293 he knows the issues backwards and forwards he doesnt need to read off a script its not really his forte so why not do something different here
596294 if mccain runs a boring conventional campaign just scratch him off as a loser today its over
596295 if he wants to win he has to roll the dice over and over and over again
596296 he has always gotten very good marks for every single convention hes spoken at beginning in 1988 in 1996 the consensus was he gave the best speech of the convention so hell be fine
596297 we certainly recognize and appreciate like everybody else that senator obama is a unique talent a once in a generation orator but being a great orator isnt a sufficient qualification for the presidency
596298 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
596299 mccain has one of the best national reputations in the country and i think the job of that acceptance speech is simply to remind voters why they have such a high opinion of him
596300 and to remind them that he understands the challenges that they are going through
596301 if you try something gimmicky and it doesnt come off well youve missed this opportunity to give this presidential type address
596302 mccain is really terrible on the teleprompter so i dont know what theyre going to do to deal with that
596303 and frankly i dont think theres any excuse for not doing well theyve known since february on the republican side that this moment will come
596304 20 000 radicals and liberals came dressed up as moderates and centrists in the greatest single exhibition of cross dressing in american political history
596305 now we hear talk that its time for a change well ladies and gentlemen another friendly reminder we are the change
596306 the tour took on the character of an out of control rampage
596307 my deepest feelings are sadness mourning grief for what my son has been through what he will go through for the rest of his life
596308 this is a situation that will follow this family for the rest of our lives
596309 he is going to die if he has to go to mexico
596310 our legal responsibility is to provide a safe discharge whether the family agrees or not we have to provide for a safe discharge
596311 the problem is hospitals cant properly guarantee that the proper level of care will be provided
596312 it is outrageous its just a total lack of humane treatment for these people
596313 chances were much more likely that you could qualify for benefits if you were undocumented
596314 serving and advocating for our sisters and brothers who are poor and disenfranchised
596315 well continue to provide the care for him as long as he needs it
596316 that to me is why we politicians get bad reputations
596317 i just thought it should have been done more openly
596318 organized effort to make me look bad and promote someones agenda
596319 ive never said there was anything illegal in what theyve done
596320 you guys might want to be looking under your cars before you leave
596321 i felt like i had parachuted blindfolded into a complete mound of political madness
596322 id like to forget that portion of my life it was the most stress ive ever had in any job or anything ive ever done
596323 und das wird garantiert auch w hrend der spiele geschehen
596324 if costs are rising here due to higher fuel prices and food prices are going up then our workers too should be entitled to what is deemed fit by the malaysian government
596325 we also want a system in place whereby if an employer accuses workers of any wrongdoing the issue will be handled with fairness
596326 9 3 before the system shuts down and upon checking abits website the code refers it as a power supply failure if you have the same problem on your pc then i recommend reading hardware secrets it points out the dos and dont when troubleshooting and procedures on how to determine the cause of the problem so i already know the culprit of my pc problem now im on a look out for a good power supply to replace the one that conked out so far my choices falls between the corsair and silverstone power supply units i did consider other brands like this entry was posted on tuesday may 27th 2008 at 7 23 pm and is filed under may 28th 2008 at 2 38 pm well if your pc kee ps on shutting down for no apprent reason it can be only 2 things overheating processor and vga or psu problems and yousaid it was a psu problem between corsair and silverstone my vote will be silverstone 700watts and above especially if you have 8800gt vga if you cant find one then go with corsairs 620 watts to 1000watts it is also good psu i do recommend either of the two to those buyers with big budget since both of them cost arms and legs if your looking to buy the corsair i suggest to buy it from pchub in gilmore just register in tipidpc com for discounts hehe zu filtern

596335 google doesnt even set a price for showing your ads adwords is auction based remember you set your own price and a major determinant is what other people bid for that spot that you would like to occupy as well
596336 and for this survey it is nothing but a swiss cheese until someone declares the questions asked the sample used and the methodology if youll try to denigrate someone at least do it seriously so that people actually take your words into account

596365 this man is about your age and he doesnt date really all that much
596366 another thing i wonder a lot about with men if you dont like someone why not tell them youre not okay with the relationship and we are through i guess i just need some input about this whole situation it really hurts me to see him go we were close we gave each other cards i just loved to hear his voice on the phone we would make each other laugh i feel like im hurting more than i think he is
596367 he is about your age and he doesnt date really and he is very stubborn i would like to know as a man what do you think is his problem
596368 i thought about that he dont hate me but because hes hurt he dont want to try again and i thought another thing too if you dont like someone why not tell them youre okay and we are through
596369 just need some input it really hurts me we were close and we gave each other cards and i just loved to hear his voice on the phone making each other laugh i feel that im hurting more than i think he is
596370 if you add this viewpoint of life onto the men not having any clue for how expressing true feelings work you have a pretty quiet and seemingly angry man by the time fifties come a creepin
596371 most psychiatrists would tell you most women are head and shoulders above men when it comes to expressing their emotions
596372 so if a man or a woman fears expressing his her emotions
596373 it is here in this mindset where you need to remove yourself from his nightmare his confusion his present frame of mind this event his suddenly disappearing may simply be another repeating drama in his life you may not be the only person to whom he has expressed such inaction

596426 on the plus side the flight of our first stage with the new merlin 1c regenerative engine that will be used in falcon 9 was picture perfect unfortunately a problem occurred in stage separation causing the stages to be held together this is under investigation
596427 spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward
596428 we have the resolve we have the financial base and we have expertise to identify what the problem that occurred was and we will go forward there should be no question about that there is great resolve here to as quickly as possible to go forward with flight 4
596429 there was great elation when we watched the first stage which was absolutely picture perfect
596430 and then there was concern when we knew that something had happened in the stage separation interestingly people here have great resolve and as elon addressed the employees immediately following this he said we will keep going straight forward with flight 4 one of our employees immediately spoke up and said with great resolve yes we will we will get to orbit and everyone sent up a cheer

596455 in the last 6 olympic games there had been an average 19 12 increase in the hosting countries stock indexes in the six months following the games in the 12 month after the olympics the stock indexes had a strong 26 14 average increase
596456 these factors caused the increase on the stock market 6 months after the sporting event
596457 the infrastructure construction system establishment and environmental protection among others for the olympics gave a lasting boost to the hosting countries economy therefore although gdp growth in those hosting countries showed a certain degree of slow down generally speaking the hosting countries economy maintained a relatively high speed of growth whats more the reduction of bubbles in the post olympics capital market has typically ensured steady and benign growth history clearing indicates that the lasting winner of the beijing olympics will be the beijing economy

596481 as far as were concerned nick is a lifer with this organization hes not going anywhere at all
596482 weve simply taken the position of founding director and split it in two so we will now have a chief curator and an executive director as the two most senior management positions nick is going to be the chief curator because its important that he be able to spend 100 percent of his attention in this area there is no one more qualified for this job than nick
596483 thanks to nicks tireless and dedicated leadership weve been successfully founded and now were ready to move on to the next phase its a function of our growth and our success that wherever possible we need to move away from people having to do multiple functions that cant be reasonably and effectively accomplished by one person which is so common in a start up operation to allow people to focus on their strengths and areas of expertise
596484 as we quietly grew to 25 full time employees the administration was getting sufficiently complex and time consuming i was also beginning to spend a lot of time on the road so the opportunity to focus on curatorial and programming affairs was a welcome relief and allows me to sail into my dotage doing what i truly love
596485 nick is still functioning as hes always functioned there is no vacancy so were going to hire the new person as soon as we can find the perfect candidate for the job
596486 i miss being able to turn on a computer have it boot in about 1 second and then start writing programs
596487 it was also nice having direct control over the system before complex operating systems took over
596488 it may seem a bit simplistic in todays world but retro has many uses and applications
596489 with the expansion port any user can connect their own devices and equipment to retro and program retro to control them
596490 whether for personal or professional use retro is affordable easy to use and above all enjoyable
596491 we need more exemplary leaders and we need them more than ever
596492 insure my rig the small fleet division of roemer insurance www insuremyrig com was built on the assumption that the computer savvy trucker would prosper during challenging times and thus be an ideal client
596493 a few years ago people laughed at the notion of
596494 we are genuinely interested in learning about how truck drivers are using technology to prosper during these difficult times
596495 we thought giving the winner a brand new laptop equipped with gaming capabilities and a built in web cam would make the contest particularly appealing
596496 we join the rest of the country in celebrating the contributions made by americas truck drivers
596497 truckers are essential to our nations economic health and to our individual comfort without them our society simply cannot function
596498 so i know how hard they work and i understand they are using computers to stay competitive and to stay in touch with family members
596499 i cant wait to give one of them a brand new shiny laptop to make their life a little easier and a lot more fun and everyone appreciates the idea of free fuel these days
596500 people think of tai chi as a slow motion exercise for the elderly thats because tai chi is misunderstood and most teachers dont truly understand it in the video lessons on my virtual school i unlock the secrets of tai chi and other arts toshow how to develop internal power
596501 as long as you have a computer and internet access you can study high quality chinese internal martial arts anytime anywhere
596502 too many people believe the power of these arts comes from something mystical
596503 they focus on this invisible energy called chi and they miss or arent told about the physical skills they need this site is dedicated to pulling back the curtain and showing principles for the physical skills that are required by these arts skills that most chinese kung fu masters wouldnt teach you for many years
596504 these people look like ordinary men but theyre like olympic athletes extremely skilled at tai chi
596505 they can break an attacker in half before you know whats happening
596506 they cant believe all the information and theyre very grateful someone is putting it online
596507 we are so proud of our company employees independent sales force members and healthcare providers our mission to provide quality affordable healthcare to the public is a partnership between ameriplan and our independent business owners together we can make a significant difference in the lives of millions of people in the coming years

596511 who are these terrorists and why do they make movies
596512 i worked with michael moore and lived to make this movie
596513 its amazing to see just how far the internet has come just in the past ten years
596514 i guess youd have to be a true computer nerd to be doing this as long as i have when you told people ten years ago that you ran a website they seemed amazed as if you were doing something magical now today its commonplace
596515 in the mid to late 90s there were a lot of music fans out there like myself that picked up on the internet long before the music industry ever took it seriously now many of the labels out there are still trying to catch up and with cd sales on the decline and digital sales on the rise the industry knows that it has to stay on top of any new technology or trend if it wants to survive
596516 as far as my dolly site goes i consider myself very blessed because the work ive done over the years has been very well received by both fellow fans and dollys people ever since the site started ive been able to connect with hundreds of fans around the world many of which have helped contribute to the site
596517 it all started out of just loving dolly parton and her music and i think its the same for anybody who runs any kind of fan site
596518 theres never been a more exciting time to be a music fan especially if youre digitally inclined fan sites are a unique way for fans to not only pay tribute to their favorite artists but to actually help promote their work and possibly make some money at the same time i think anytime a fan can help increase the exposure of an artist its a good thing to look back and know that i was able to play an active role in promoting music that i love is really exciting
596519 this new version adds an entirely new functionality to mpess fydp application that we believe will be robust enough to meet our future requirements for the foreseeable future
596520 on behalf of the entire af a1m family i want to thank segue technologies for being our wingman and helping ensure we achieved total mission accomplishment
596521 their sense of community support is evident through their great work on our event and i am grateful they are one of our partners and sponsor
596522 giving back to the community is a good thing giving back and making the community look fabulous is even better
596523 in terms of retail sales dvd x copy platinum remains the
596524 i dont know if robert benchley ever commented on operas in his writings but it is certainly a subject i suspect he would have handled exactly as you did
596525 it certainly brought back the memories of when i first started reading robert benchley and the joy his writing brought
596526 the judging was difficult because the finalists were so good
596527 really good writing is timeless benchley created like the persona jack benny created a man who was very much full of himself but in a self deprecating way
596528 my influences came from the more absurdist side of life
596529 larry gilbert writer on your show of shows a funny thing happened on the way to the forum and others too numerous to remember once wrote the comedy writer and comedian sees the world through a different lens
596530 i was a voracious reader of the works of robert benchley
596531 and at least on a subconscious level one of benchleys essays influenced me to go to law school it was about a walter mitty type character who made an absolute fool out of the opposing counsel to the point where the jury was applauding and even the judge was enjoying the show
596532 yikes i cant believe it thanks im still in shock
596533 i can barely maintain my sobriety cuz the great robert benchley society held a contest and wow im a finalist now will i win the top prize high anxiety
596534 now that ive actually won first prize im thrilled and honored but being jewish im still anxious
596535 how to watch a sad movie and retain your manliness
596536 hooray thank you so much and many thanks to mr newhart
596537 in fact right now im making sounds to express my thrilledness but they cant be conveyed in an email without doing some small damage to the keyboard
596538 essays are tough especially at 500 words i wrote my entry in a benchleyesq frenzy i was reading a lot of sweet old bob at the time and the influence shows benchley has always been my favorite humorist
596539 to go from being an accountant to being a stand up comic has always been a dream of mine
596540 thanks for the wonderful news i assume this means i get my 10 entry fee back
596541 all who value humor look up to robert benchley and wonder how the hell does he make it look so easy for this benchley aficionado its a bit numbing having my name linked with his
596542 and this is back when 30 a week was like 20 a week
596543 knowing bob newhart actually read something i wrote even if he barely got through the first paragraph before crumpling and tossing it is intimidating i have grown up with newharts albums stand up movies and television to understand and appreciate what a brilliant humorist he is
596544 this would be the highlight of my career if i had one
596545 the book that most impressed me when i was growing up and influenced my approach to comedy would have been any book by robert benchley or specifically my ten years in a quandary
596546 all entries are read blind so neither bob newhart nor any of the preliminary judges knew who wrote any of the essays that way the competition is entirely merit based
596547 but darn i will enter again next year and see if i make the top ten one more time ill be the poor mans ed tasca he placed 3 times maybe i can get on the top ten list 3 times
596548 i believe mr benchley would be pleased to see how this years contestants are keeping alive his tradition of warm genial witty humor
596549 i hope future judges are as lucky as i was in the quality of their finalists
596550 do you have souvenirs anything i can remember this place by
596551 it feels like were losing a piece of our legacy a piece of long beach that wont exist anymore
596552 if we would have been able to hold on we would have probably been here until we turned to dirt but thats not possible
596553 designing a successful environment for a medical practice requires totally different knowledge and skills than standard interior design at medical environments we apply intelligent eco friendly aesthetics which create patient comfort and confidence while emphasizing clinical efficiency
596554 finding a first job has become much more difficult than when many of us embarked on our careers
596555 we just felt it was important to provide some choice in our menu
596556 lots of europeans will now get what that dollar amount is in their currency
596557 theres no way in hell the house you buy now will be more expensive next year
596558 you want to have enough savings or cash flow to weather a downsizing in the workforce
596559 we listened to a lot of people saying dont touch that
596560 but we borrowed out of it and were retired and just fine
596561 we paid the loan back in about a year but after we were done we started looking at what we had lost by not having that money in the stock market
596562 for us it would have been smarter to have lived in an apartment for a couple of years and just saved for a down payment
596563 but before you tap the plan you want to make sure that youve thought it through small decisions made today can have enormous consequences
596564 i just want to alert people to the true cost
596565 i had all these papers that said what we would have had if we hadnt touched that money but i dont think were ever going to look
596566 well you know without men like mr coers we might not be living lives this well
596567 i think hes kind of given up his will to go on
596568 ive had people i havent talked to in years offer us a place to stay
596569 when we suggested there was a fiscally responsible way to run the district
596570 all about what they did at the fire department its a lack of confidence
596571 its a challenge but its really exciting mistakes have been made weve got to get past those
596572 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world
596573 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
596574 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
596575 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
596576 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
596577 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
596578 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
596579 i regret that it now appears bocog has announced that there will be limitations on website access during games time
596580 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
596581 we are going to do our best to facilitate the foreign media to do their reporting work through the internet
596582 i would remind you that falun gong is an evil fake religion which has been banned by the chinese government
596583 we condemn the iocs failure to do anything about this and we are more skeptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely
596584 in this short a time frame even if you took all the personal cars off the highway you might see another 10 percent improvement but it would be small
596585 the best thing that could happen during the games is to have it rain every night
596586 everybodys trying to figure out how to lower levels of acrylamide without significantly adversely affecting taste
596587 let no individual section faction or group ever regard itself as greater than the organisation and the common good of all our people our nation comes from a history of deep division and strife let us never through our deeds or words take our people back down that road
596588 this is so fantastical a conjecture it doesnt warrant a response
596589 id like to know if journalism is now a totally allegations based business or if you guys actually still look at real evidence
596590 noted the comments of the constitutional court judges in the search warrants matter
596591 all courts should discourage litigation before an actual trial that seems to delay the commencement of trials
596592 generally disallowing such litigation would ensure that trials start sooner rather than later
596593 if the judiciary is weakened it will not be the only victim the rule of law will erode and the other public institutions that guarantee our constitutional rights will be left unprotected
596594 they must be allowed to keep state power in check
596595 msholozi told us that he also doesnt understand how the taxi recapitalisation programme can work in rural areas where poor people earn so little and would not afford these vehicles
596596 using the internet has got to be the cheapest way of banking given the cost of cheques and withdrawing cash
596597 one no longer has to go into the bank it is in your pocket
596598 we have seen heavy acceleration in growth of users in the past six months
596599 many people take a taxi and go to town to check their balances some end up going home disappointed if money promised is not put into their account

596603 ive always used wilson and i just wanted to try out the rawlings to see if i liked it
596604 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world
596605 christina is following the recommended treatment of her doctors and will have a full recovery
596606 hvorfor v gner jeg s selv f rst op nu det g r jeg fordi det naturligvis virker utroligt provokerende p mig at jeg sidste torsdag deltager i ministerr dsm de i bruxelles hvor emnet er den illegale indvandring hvor landene i st rre eller mindre omfang beklager sig over de mange illegale flygtninge der kommer over eus gr nser og hvor hele diskussionen g r ud p at udforme initiativer der kan stoppe denne illegale indvandring og jeg s dagen efter ser en ef dom der synes at g i den stik modsatte retning en dom som jeg ikke kan afvise kan v re med til i hvert fald hvis gr dige menneskesmuglere kommer til og s tter tingene i system at hvidvaske den illegale indvandring blot ved at en eu borger rejser til et naboland i kortere tid og s gifter sig med et indsmuglet menneske
596607 i am right behind pole position so it might be a little better than being third or fourth i qualified fifth here last year and i performed well so i am not too concerned at the moment
596608 it was tricky out there in superpole though because whoever was out there last and taking the risks would do well but i didnt want to crash before the races i am more of a fan of doing it over one lap rather than doing four fast laps but you have to do what you have to do
596609 yes please yes im sure i definitely want to shoe my head
596610 we want to make sure that illinois taxpayers are getting what they paid for
596611 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
596612 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
596613 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
596614 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
596615 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
596616 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
596617 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
596618 as we meet our country is in the sixth year of a two front war our economy is struggling our planet is in peril these challenges and many others demand new leadership
596619 she was so much about being one with the world and mother nature and there was a certain amount of understanding in her that you could see behind her eyes
596620 this is truly an honor and an awesome awesome moment in my life
596621 getting here did not come without controversy but through it all im here with a greater appreciation for something that not every player is able to achieve and for the people who stood up for me and spoke out on my behalf the love and support ive received over the last seven eight years has been overwhelming and i appreciate it very much
596622 by being here i realize now that its more than just having a bust made of yourself and wearing a gold jacket
596623 when you take the time to look through all the hype and the celebration that comes along with this you see that its really all about history the tradition of the game and an elite group of athletes who helped make the game what it is today
596624 its going to require a whole lot more in resources to be able to provide appropriate medical care for this additional 160 000 people
596625 i hope these new estimates do serve as a wake up call
596626 the fact remains there are too many people becoming infected with hiv every year
596627 many of us felt for some time that the methodology originally used was flawed
596628 from our perspective this is certainly indicative of poor planning and poor administration of things going on at cdc
596629 this means that cdcs ability to measure the true scope of the epidemic has improved
596630 there have never been more people living with hiv in the united states or in massachusetts and there will be more tomorrow because of our success in keeping people alive and well
596631 its only going to get worse if we dont match what were seeing with funding and evidence based prevention programs
596632 i dont think two games and two wins makes a career but its two wins and im happy to be a part of it
596633 it hasnt been a big sample size against lefthanders just havent faced a lot this year so far
596634 april was kind of a buzz saw for me i was in a funk but i never think that i dont hit lefties well because ive always hit them and i certainly feel more confident facing lefthanded pitchers
596635 i hope by the end of the year things will be where they usually are
596636 i had a rough first inning and guys come out and swing the bat really well
596637 it was nice to have a break between innings and then come out and have a nice cushion
596638 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
596639 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
596640 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues

596652 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
596653 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
596654 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
596655 they were cleaning the street when this huge explosion rocked the entire neighbourhood i counted 15 bodies most of them are women who were torn to pieces
596656 there are about 15 dead at the moment and a number of wounded that i cannot estimate
596657 there is blood everywhere dead and wounded people strewn across the street
596658 this is a tragedy i have never seen such carnage from what i can see they are all women who were cleaning the area

596677 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
596678 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
596679 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
596680 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
596681 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
596682 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
596683 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
596684 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
596685 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
596686 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
596687 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
596688 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
596689 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
596690 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
596691 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
596692 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
596693 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
596694 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
596695 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
596696 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
596697 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
596698 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
596699 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
596700 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
596701 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
596702 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
596703 who are open to doing something on the production side
596704 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
596705 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
596706 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
596707 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
596708 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
596709 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
596710 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
596711 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
596712 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
596713 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
596714 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
596715 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
596716 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
596717 ich h tte nie gedacht dass sich eine stadt in zwei jahren so ver ndern kann
596718 w re ich erst heuer zum ersten mal nach peking gekommen h tte mich die neugierde von meinem job angeh ngt
596719 ist eine wahnsinns stadt mit einem tollen flair und berall sp rt man die gro e freude mit der alle den spielen entgegenfiebern
596720 ich liebe rolando wir haben bereits ein projekt zusammen gemacht den sonntag hier in salzburg verbringen wir gemeinsam um ein brainstorming zu machen
596721 ich kann nichts ber die oper erz hlen weil die zeit daf r zu kurz ist aber f r mich ist klar dass ich nicht in einer minuten jene gef hle rauskotzen m chte die ich in drei stunden erlebt habe
596722 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
596723 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
596724 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
596725 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
596726 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
596727 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
596728 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
596729 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
596730 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
596731 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
596732 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
596733 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
596734 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
596735 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
596736 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
596737 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
596738 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
596739 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
596740 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
596741 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
596742 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
596743 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
596744 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
596745 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
596746 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
596747 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
596748 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
596749 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
596750 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
596751 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
596752 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
596753 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
596754 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
596755 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
596756 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
596757 the moral hazard idea is the notion that before things go bad how can we put in place a system that would give all the players in the system an incentive to do the right thing
596758 but to some extent the big players since they are high leverage institutions which means they are playing mostly with your money not theirs he said still have this incentive to make some risky bets because if they pay off they win huge and if they dont pay off they just go bankrupt losing mostly other peoples money
596759 we are a free democratic county we dont want regulation
596760 you dont want taxes but we all want roads and police and good schools
596761 its sort of the same thing with deregulation which began back in the 80s in the reagan era and people got too caught up in it
596762 bank deposit insurance is a good example thats regulation for the banks but they like it because it covers them in case of collapse
596763 if you are going to regulate on the side of giving the big players like banks something you should also regulate on the side of keeping them from exploiting people
596764 and some of what we see now is even beyond exploitation
596765 the short answer is if we dont bail them out it is going to create such financial turmoil that we the taxpayers will in the long run suffer even more than we will now
596766 in this case the regulations that would make sure moral hazards are shared by all
596767 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
596768 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
596769 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
596770 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
596771 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
596772 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
596773 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
596774 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we

596778 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
596779 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
596780 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
596781 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
596782 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
596783 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
596784 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
596785 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

596846 its a great look at what it means to be a fan at how nascar creeps its way into our everyday lives if you want proof that youre not the only nascar fan who is non southern non redneck non homo phobic non fill in the blank with your favorite stereotype and youre not crazy for spending your hard earned money on little metal cars you should read this book
596847 his writing is strong and clear his convictions spring from every page and his love of nascar is obvious i have a hard time imagining somebody having more fun writing anything than wilson must have had writing this book read it and youll know what i mean
596848 i want to see you wiggle it just a little bit
596849 mom emmas friends and i were throwing the puppies off the deck daddy said i have to take a nap and im not even tired
596850 the answer may stink but eating or drinking anything gives us gas in fact its normal to fart up to half of a gallon 1 9 liters or about 15 to 20 toots worth of gas each day
596851 in the process of converting our meals into useful nutrients these food munching microbes produce a smelly by product of hydrogen sulfide gas the same stench that emanates from rotten eggs

596854 tengo la impresi n de que saliste ganando con el cambio
596855 cette p riode du week end du vendredi 1er ao t au dimanche 3 ao t sera la plus difficile de l t 2008 et m me tr s certainement de toute lann e 2008
596856 ambition of the current shareholders to reach the premier league in the near future
596857 yes its a high profile appointment but id much prefer to take over at a club with expectations than one that hasnt
596858 no nothing like that though clearly this is an ambitious club we want success and that means getting us out of this division but if were in and around the play offs and its clear that everyones pushing the right way then thats great
596859 ive always said its about evolution not revolution we still want to try and pick up one or two more players but youve got to be sensible and not goout and smash the wage budget we want to do things sensibly and build week on week year on year
596860 the situation at charlton was difficult you can accept richard murrays decision ive got no animosity about that the coventry ones different i left the club eight points above relegation they finished one point above relegation if thats an improvement i dont know the meaning of the word nonetheless ive nothing to prove to the people at coventry
596861 im too old 43 to get bitter and twisted we all know what football is today its a very short term business people make decisions its down to them to live with that you have got to move on
596862 it wouldnt even surprise me if swansea nottingham forest or doncaster dont come up and have a little go palace finished very well under neil warnock sheffield united had a great end of season and burnley and barnsley have spent money
596863 we dowie and his assistant tim flowers have come in here worked very hard and the players have embraced what were trying to do well be a fit organised unit though theres other teams in the division whove spent more that doesnt alter the fact that this club is run by eminently successful people who want the same from qpr im not na ve enough to think this doesnt bring pressure
596864 the profile the owners bring to the club is one of expectation and far be it from me to worry about that you have to embrace it its much much better to be a club with expectations than one without
596865 is talk of being favourites premature yes it probably is i think its more to do with the hype that surrounds the club but im not going to change the fact were favourites so why worry about it
596866 people are going to try and knock us off our perch but we have to use that as a positive im building a team to get qpr out of the championship talk of building a team to survive in the premier league thats something we will be dealing with next summer in an ideal world
596867 ledesma and di carmine are my signings ive never had an issue or discussion with the board about selection not once
596868 the owners should be given a lot of credit as they havent come in and gone absolutely bananas theyve not spent 7 million on a player and given him 70 000 a week wages
596869 i dont think it would be right to splash 50 million on players
596870 ive been around football long enough to know its becoming more precarious if you work short term and make short term decisions well im not like that we are putting systems in place and we are doing that for a reason
596871 the sunday times brian doogan august 3 2008 qpr push for promotion money is no object for qpr but they will not follow chelseas example
596872 ik weet dat ik op de 200 vrij normaal gesproken alleen michael phelps voor me hoef te dulden maar ook die is niet onverslaanbaar de 100 vrij is echter een afstand waar ik bezeten van ben om mijn ultieme droom op dat nummer na te jagen moet alles wijken zelfs een medaille die me op een ander nummer niet lijkt te kunnen ontgaan
596873 these are things we have been doing for a long time
596874 i dont think you can have a policy for every scenario
596875 cuatro semanas antes de la invasi n de irak que se produjo en la noche del 19 al 20 de marzo de 2003 george w
596876 dentro de este plan bush hab a terminado por aceptar el 31 de enero de 2003 tras una entrevista con el primer ministro brit nico tony blair introducir una ltima maniobra diplom tica la propuesta de una segunda resoluci n del consejo de seguridad de naciones unidas
596877 bush era consciente de las dificultades internas de blair y no desconoc a las de aznar
596878 aznar hab a viajado el 20 de febrero con su esposa ana botella a estados unidos haciendo una escala en m xico para persuadir infructuosamente al presidente vicente fox de la necesidad de apoyar a bush
596879 en la reuni n del d a siguiente s bado participaron el presidente bush su entonces asesora de seguridad nacional condoleezza rice y el responsable de asuntos europeos del consejo de seguridad nacional daniel fried
596880 el embajador rup rez tradujo del ingl s para aznar y tambi n del italiano para condoleezza rice otras dos int rpretes hicieron su trabajo para bush y sus colaboradores
596881 la conversaci n impresiona por su tono directo amigable y hasta amenazador cuando por ejemplo se refiere a la necesidad de que pa ses como m xico chile angola camer n y rusia miembros del consejo de seguridad de la o nu voten la nueva resoluci n como una muestra de amistad hacia estados unidos o se atengan a las consecuencias
596882 se advierte la nula expectativa en el trabajo de los inspectores cuyo jefe hans blix hab a desmontado hac a solo una semana el 14 de febrero los argumentos expuestos por el secretario de estado norteamericano colin powell ante el consejo de seguridad el 5 de febrero de 2003 con datos s lidos apoyados calurosamente por la ministra de exteriores espa ola ana palacio
596883 seg n blix irak estaba dando pasos hacia una cooperaci n activa para resolver los temas de desarme pendientes
596884 el director general del organismo internacional de la energ a at mica oiea mohamed el baradei inform el 14 de febrero de que todav a quedaban por aclarar algunas cuestiones t cnicas pero a adi no quedan ya problemas de desarme por resolver
596885 tanto los primeros frutos de la labor de inspecci n como la finalizaci n de los preparativos de estados unidos llevaron a bush a fijar el comienzo de la operaci n militar hacia la fecha del 10 de marzo de 2003 a la cual se a adieron nueve d as para obtener la segunda resoluci n
596886 el fracaso de esta cobertura legal de la guerra inminente llev a bush a acordar con blair y aznar la celebraci n el 16 de marzo de 2003 de una cumbre en las islas azores lugar sugerido por aznar como alternativa a las islas bermudas por una raz n que l mismo explic a bush el solo nombre de esas islas va asociado a una prenda de vestir que no es precisamente la m s adecuada para la gravedad del momento en que nos encontramos all ese 16 de marzo bush blair y aznar decidieron sustituir al consejo de seguridad de naciones unidas y usurparon sus funciones para declarar por su cuenta y riesgo la guerra contra irak en la ma ana del 17 de marzo el embajador del reino unido ante la o nu anunciaba en nueva york la retirada de la segunda resoluci n una derrota en la votaci n hubiera complicado m s la carrera hacia la guerra

596889 jur dicamente vinculante para su ratificaci n o bien para autorizar la celebraci n de una consulta habilitadora que abra un proceso de soluci n
596890 para que la c mara pueda valorar y decidir sobre dos posibilidades la ratificaci n del acuerdo alcanzado con zapatero y la petici n de autorizaci n para celebrar un refer ndum o la autorizaci n para la realizaci n de una consulta habiitadora para superar la situaci n de bloqueo y que sea la sociedad vasca con su decisi n quien nos traslade el mandato de abrir un doble proceso de di logo y negociaci n que conduzca al final de la violencia y del conflicto
596891 el pacto pol tico alcanzado y no se aceptara la consulta ratificadora del mismo o si en su caso se decidiera negar la autorizaci n de una consulta habilitadora que abra un proceso de soluci n

596952 i have a feeling mrs wulff might have walked in on him and all hell broke loose
596953 we went ahead and did it mainly to satisfy the family but we knew that wasnt going to fly
596954 i think im at peace with that the fact that closure and physical remains arent with us is obviously a concern
596955 i knew i wasnt the average kid walking around campus
596956 i had to think how i was going to survive and make it work and try to be a normal seventh and eighth grader as much as i could
596957 it forced me to process what am i going to do how am i going to live day to day it became a survival piece for me
596958 he became very introspective he didnt cry my brother and he shared a room and he said paul never cried
596959 even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil
596960 the thing thats so vivid in my mind was the devotion paul had to tammy
596961 he would come back and he had great passion for the kids he was coaching he would be right back in the middle of it at a very high level
596962 i didnt think much of him to tell you the truth
596963 i know who she is god has really kind of laid all this out
596964 for paul to sit in a room one on one with a young man or a group of kids in a meeting room and say hey guys ive been through tough times and tough times dont last but tough people do
596965 ich bin ganz sicher wenn die entscheidung heute noch einmal getroffen werden m sste dann w rde sie genau so ausgehen

596969 esta es una activa actualizada suenan algunas canciones actuales pero de momento son bien pocas el fuerte es volver a recuperar todo ese disco y dance olvidado por las dem s radios en otras palabras volver a la pista
596970 parece que el blog de la cdm y el foro 2006 tuvieron una buenisima respuesta por parte de los ejecutivos de iberoamerican al constatar que muchos chilenos nos quedamos con las manos vac as y obligados a escuchar las radios adulto fome o musica pokemona porque la energia positiva se hab a acabado

596984 we all wish he would come back but he has given no indication that he will
596985 i suppose we are all publicly saying what a terrific bloke he is what a fantastic political talent he is how much we miss him we love him we want him
596986 plainly he is an extraordinarily talented man but we have a leader hes had a tough week and i dont want to make it any tougher for him
596987 i think that what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once but sadly have not yet had and probably never will
596988 peter costello has earned the right to make the decision about his future with his own family in the best interests of both them and the people of higgins

596992 keiner ist unschlagbar aber so wie er zuletzt gespielt hat hat keiner von uns gedacht dass er so schnell verlieren w rde
596993 ich habe versucht nicht an seine siegesserie zu denken vielmehr wollte ich mich auf mein spiel konzentrieren und das ist mir ja auch gelungen
596994 the asian unions including the association of south east asian nations asean the economic cooperation organization eco and the south asian association for regional cooperation saarc should strengthen convergence within the framework of an asian parliament with the aim of playing a greater international role
596995 wir best tigen den wechsel es ist eine sehr interessante herausforderung f r alparslan erdem man hat ihm bei galatasaray eine gute rolle in der mannschaft in aussicht gestellt nichtsdestotrotz ist sein abgang sehr schade weil er auch bei uns f r den erweiterten kreis vorgesehen war und eine perspektive vorhanden gewesen w re
596996 fakt ist auch dass bei uns auf der position hinten links ein gro er konkurrenzkampf herrscht und dar ber hinaus viele junge leute nachkommen von galatasaray gab es f r alle seiten ein reizvolles angebot dass sich f r uns finanziell sehr lukrativ gestaltete
596997 schlie lich habe ich hier eine sch ne zeit gehabt und mich sehr wohl gef hlt doch ich sehe bei galatasaray die bessere sportliche perspektive
596998 ein gro teil meiner familie lebt in istanbul so dass ich mich schnell zu hause f hlen werde
596999 wir h tten mit alparslan gerne weiter zusammengearbeitet und auch seinen vertrag verl ngert aber er hat den wunsch ge u ert zu wechseln diesem wunsch sind wir nachgekommen
597000 dieser wechsel zeigt erneut dass unsere ausgebildeten spieler immer auch interessant f r andere vereine sind
597001 das ist f r uns sowohl sportlich als auch menschlich ein gro er verlust aber ich kann verstehen dass galatasaray f r ihn eine gro e chance ist
597002 has done a clever job of keeping in the flavor and phrasing of austens work intact and ann kapp andersens music is dramatic and beautiful
597003 were not in the business of doing textbooks but i think comic books really do have the great potential to inform and teach
597004 are we there yet the golden age of american family vacations
597005 maybe he just never knew how much he was loved
597006 never be able to make sense of what it was steven saw
597007 nobody has ever questioned his toughness he wants to play every day he shows up to win and tonight was a great example of that
597008 when i slow down is when i feel it grabbing not so much when im running it doesnt let me extend normally
597009 thats why were going to talk to the doctor and see what he wants to do maybe with a supersonic anti inflammatory it will come down
597010 weve tried heat stretch stim ultrasound massage weve kind of exhausted everything i dont know its just a nagging thing that hasnt gone away
597011 thankfully its not a major aspect of the game for me
597012 im not that fast to start so i really feel slow
597013 i never contacted the red sox after the deal was made
597014 both parties agreed that it was in the best interest of everyone involved for manny to move forward
597015 from my point of view in dealing with the red sox they did things in a forthright manner
597016 hes getting used to la hell do fine out there he can hit anywhere
597017 the ball was coming out of his hand on a downward plane with velocity that was good
597018 it seems like guys are turning the page and having fun obviously having jason bay over here is nice but i dont think that changed our attitudes any we all feel the same we want to win and were having fun now
597019 mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
597020 i was still negotiating with them and then i heard i was traded
597021 i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed
597022 additionally i would like to sincerely apologize to those fans offended by my wrongful actions last saturday night it was an overreaction on my part to what i felt was a series of public inaccurate and unfair remarks about me
597023 when we spread it out we can get him out of there
597024 i dont know how much that will make him feel good for today nobody has ever questioned his toughness he wants to play every day he shows up to win and tonight was a great example of that
597025 i was sore one day and it really hasnt gone away
597026 weve tried heat stretch stim ultrasound massage i got a cortisone shot before the all star break weve kind of exhausted everything its just been a nagging thing that hasnt gone away
597027 i dont think its any worse than its been for the last five weeks i might get some type of injection in the next couple of days or something i dont know i actually just asked the trainers and they told me theyd let me know

597067 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

597126 we were each handed a small styrofoam boat with a candle on it we walked down to the shore line and let the candle boat float out onto the lake the twinkling lights of the flames on the dark water was an awesome sight as though a thousand fireflies glittered in the dark night and my summer started to fade away as the boat floated farther and farther away

597133 giving them something for themselves as opposed to something that theyll never wear again is more meaningful
597134 most women when they come in here they want it

597356 we paid the loan back in about a year but after we were done we started looking at what we had lost by not having that money in the stock market
597357 for us it would have been smarter to have lived in an apartment for a couple of years and just saved for a down payment

597385 weve got a great receiver coach weve got a great offense
597386 so any time they can get guys in here that can play the receiver position theres going to be competition and i believe the competition is going to bring out the best in all of us

597393 all the talk is over beckys playing for russia right now and were taking care of our business
597394 i think a lot of it has been the media in the states making it a lot bigger than it is
597395 you know were not really worried about her were worried about russia as a whole if anything its one less player we have to study a lot because we know her game so well playing against her we respect her and her game
597396 i dont think the becky thing is going to be an issue unless it comes down to the medal round during this tournament it doesnt have any kind of hutzpah when it comes down to crunch time if it comes down to winning a gold or silver thats when there will be a little more to it

597459 laws are common in both parts of the valley but the problem lies with the law enforcing agencies the authorities of puppet administration have given a free hand to the people disturbing peace in jammu while force was excessively used to suppress the similar protest in kashmir in the month of june
597460 on monday august 4 fruit growers from different parts of the valley would march towards muzaffarabad to export their fruit we would start from sopore fruit mandi
597461 this is the right time to make the truck service functional and save the fruit industry
597462 we had opportunities to do something stupid and we didnt do it
597463 hes not calling to see if you want to go to breakfast
597464 it is true that youngs rhetoric during a time of war was part of the backdrop against which the massacre happened
597465 a systematic effort to cover up and destroy records diaries and court records of the day
597466 we have got to give a lot of credit to the lds church for stepping up and owning the mountain meadows massacre
597467 this is something that has been swept under the rug denied and hidden for 151 years this book represents a real paradigm shift and thats remarkable
597468 we came up with the idea for the book ourselves we were not assigned to do it
597469 we sought the cooperation of church leaders to get access to information such as the first presidencys confidential collection but asked that we retain full editorial control and theyve honored that
597470 the trio of authors has properly tagged direct responsibility for the massacre on local church leaders and nauvoo legion officers with southern paiutes playing a minor role
597471 i give credit to the authors for this somewhat nontraditional view as well as their willingness to rescue the reputation of the victims from the appalling vilification thats taken place for 150 years they have also identified the impact of gov brigham youngs overheated rhetoric and provocative actions in helping to create a violent atmosphere in utah leading up to the massacre
597472 make obsolete previous studies and without doubt will constitute the necessary starting point for all future ones
597473 our marching orders as i understood them were to find the truth and tell it thats what we have tried to do
597474 my feeling is the best approach is to face it
597475 its a terrible sad story and a hard one to read we cant condone what they did but we can try to understand it good history brings you into the story in a way that you can understand yourself you should wonder what would i have done had i been there
597476 all you can do is get on the table and pull
597477 but its your whole body youve got to know where youre going what youre going to do and what hes going to do
597478 i work hard to be where i am in the sport
597479 who at 50 years old would hang with these 20 year old monsters
597480 im not very happy about it i sure as heck dont want it
597481 as far as a wal mart home depot or big box ill protest ill chain myself
597482 we could go in there and put some strip malls in and nobody would be happy
597483 but we dont want to do that we want to do something we and the residents can both be proud of
597484 now what they do see of the city is just basically the road and a few minor commercial businesses everyone knows the 7 eleven

597487 he does this all the time hes always out hiking
597488 i never wanted to go with him he was so fast at hiking hed leave me in the dust
597489 the story i hear consistently from the people that go in to get their visas
597490 said george frandsen north americas regional executive secretary of the international organization of folk art said the department recognizes the importance of cultural exchanges and tries to facilitate the visas
597491 we know the benefit to america when they come to share their culture with us and we issue visas to thousands of folk artists musicians people coming here to share little bits of their culture with us every year
597492 but in the end the office is going to have to make the decision from the information each applicant provides them will this particular applicant at the end of the conference or cultural event return to their home country
597493 i dont want to start again another life in america
597494 i believed as artist and teacher that i have a value in the spirit of america the united states who always have fought for the rights of man and the blooming of education and culture
597495 in spite of our preparation for almost six months for this congress where we wanted to teach of our algerian culture our dream was broken in a few instant
597496 it was this mans dream really to come to the country
597497 i hear the same story repeatedly from different people in different parts of the world
597498 she absolutely refused i am not going back to the u
597499 increasing demand for these visas and the heightened sensitivity to immigration issues has made it more and more difficult to secure the visas needed for this event
597500 however i continue to work with the appropriate embassies to secure the necessary visas
597501 i thought always your embassy give visa for genuine person who have very well status in nepal but i am wrong
597502 my intention is not to stay in your country i never trust u s embassy in my life
597503 i really do understand that the overwhelming majority of fans wanted so badly for me to succeed
597504 additionally i would like to sincerely apologize to those fans offended by my wrongful actions last saturday night it was an overreaction on my part to what i felt was a series of public inaccurate and unfair remarks about me
597505 we are an organization of values and we expect all of our members to live by them we are charged with keeping our citizens safe from harm and we take that responsibility very seriously
597506 i have had some cases come to my attention that cause me to wonder whether we are becoming a little too conservative on our approach to prosecutions
597507 please do not take this as an accusation i do not mean to reprimand or to offend but i wanted to discuss with you some points that i hope will help you with your evaluation of your cases
597508 i almost felt guilty when i saw my impact on the budget
597509 i looked at that picture the first time and didnt know we had a pow camp here
597510 but one older man told us how when he was a boy he remembered going up to the barbed wire fence and talking to the men and sometimes they would give him candy
597511 you can talk about a building or place but it is hard to etch an image of it in the minds eye without a photograph
597512 there are so many facets of a community that people dont understand
597513 here he is generating 44 000 volts of electricity to send to the mercur mine but he has to read by a coal oil lamp
597514 or you can move toward a new model which is more efficient
597515 i would be derelict if i didnt at least for the next year give it a go
597516 even if hes just out to dinner with his family hes still the governor people still come up to him and talk to him about their concerns and he does that willingly and happily hes here to make the most of the time that he has as governor
597517 i do not think governor huntsman intends to discriminate against people with children but i have noticed that most of the state employees who find it difficult to accommodate his mandate are the ones who have them i cannot even imagine how a younger state employee could negotiate having a new baby with this schedule so much for the idea that utah values families
597518 i am one state employee who is glad to have a governor not afraid to make a bold decision in a difficult time
597519 huntsmans plan is not without risk and it will cause some hardship but real leadership does not wait for opinion surveys and public forums
597520 are you going to hesitate based upon fear of the unknown
597521 no state has done it writ large were going to be the first
597522 the mother and two daughters got down on their hands and knees hugged my legs and kissed my blood stained brain splattered boots
597523 from that moment on i knew that everything wed done was wrong and will continue to be wrong
597524 i see too many empty seats here what that tells me is that too many took president bush at his word and are still shopping
597525 if we stay silent the blood is on all of our hands
597526 the time for phone calls and letters is over we need to raise our fists put down our rifles and tell them were tired of doing their killing
597527 it is time that we prepare oxbow to be reopened
597528 if people think were only keeping people who peed on a sidewalk we aint
597529 i dont think we know if this is a two week problem or a two year problem
597530 is it a summer spike or is this more to the extent that we need secured beds to keep scary people off the streets oxbow is probably the next choice
597531 these early releases should concern us all a great deal
597532 the message you send to people when you book and release them is that the criminal justice system is completely ineffective and that they can act without any risk of consequence
597533 look at our crime stats look at what is happening in our community right now there is no question that jail overcrowding has a direct effect
597534 im not a big fan of opening prisons for the sake of opening prisons
597535 but if the current facility is inadequate for meeting the demand then we should increase the supply
597536 the more people are not caught or not punished when they are caught undermines the value of deterrence
597537 this isnt some great mystery that is being unveiled right now
597538 within the community of offenders it is common knowledge that you are going to be booked and released
597539 it was a decision made by the marikina sports commission to limit the 21k to male participants only because they felt that there might be very few or no female participants at all well take note of your concern and maybe in our succeeding events we will consider all genders in the 21k category
597540 no me importar a perder todos los partidos siempre y cuando ganemos la liga
597541 si no crees que vas a ganar no tiene sentido salir de la cama al final de cada d a

597544 la prensa es muy mentirosa dicen que me he acostado con 200 mujeres pero solo fueron 100

597546 me gustar a jugar en un equipo italiano como el barcelona
597547 he remitido al club una solicitud para ser traspasado pero d jenme decir que no quiero dejar el leicester
597548 estaba viendo en directo el partido el del blackburn por la televisi n cuando vi que george nadh hab a marcado en el primer minuto mi primera reacci n fue coger el tel fono para llamarle luego me di cuenta que no pod a ponerse por que estaba jugando
597549 sin haber sido tan duro con david beckham hubi ramos perdido el partido
597550 estoy tan feliz como uno puede estar pero he estado m s feliz
597551 leeds es una gran club y ha sido mi casa durante mucho tiempo a pesar de que viv a en middlesbrough
597552 recib un golpe en mi tobillo izquierdo pero algo me dijo que era mi derecho
597553 no pude acostumbrarme a vivir en italia era como estar en un pa s extranjero
597554 alemania es un equipo muy dif cil juegan con 11 internacionales cada vez
597555 siempre me pongo primero mi bota derecha y luego obviamente mi calcet n izquierdo

597570 gnomes on the other hand are smurf like things with beards that sit with fishing rods in the gardens of people who dont know the meaning of taste
597571 another comment like that and youll be wearing your ass as a hat
597572 four years ago in athens we presented only five sports plus the opening and closing ceremonies in hd
597573 they were truly boutique presentations they had separate groups of announcers they had limited cameras
597574 the thing for me thats so amazing is how quickly the technology has matured
597575 we will absolutely not manufacture or inflame patriotic moments at the games
597576 while still addressing the needs of our advertisers affiliates and nbc universals significant investment
597577 we have a billion dollars worth of revenue at stake here
597578 to our affiliates and our advertisers our responsibility is to aggregate the biggest audience that we can and to our audience that means putting it on when they say they want it which is when theyre available to watch it and thats in prime time
597579 i told the new head of the ioc jacques rogge that it would be almost impossible for an american network bidding on the games in the future if you knew they were going to be in the far east not to have some way to have live happen
597580 the ioc did this in hopes that it would help in the market thats the most important to them
597581 the community is coming in force to support and to be exposed to what we are offering
597582 and yet we cannot do justice to its needs in the extremely limited space that we have
597583 this will probably be hopefully the only time the aspen art museum ever builds a building and we want to get it right the first time
597584 it has to be perfect so we dont want to have a learning curve for the architect
597585 these are art museums and you say where is the art
597586 its a small museum even though it seems much bigger than what we have currently
597587 so were hoping to be very prudent and modest in our design and design a lot of flexibility into it
597588 we wanted to be able to have a strong case when we go out and look for additional funding to be able to say that everyone close to us has already given
597589 in terms of where ban fits in with everything thats been done
597590 i would say that libeskind is the most expressive and either adjaye or cloepfil the most minimal and that ours is maybe somewhere in between
597591 if costs are rising here due to higher fuel prices and food prices are going up then our workers too should be entitled to what is deemed fit by the malaysian government
597592 we also want a system in place whereby if an employer accuses workers of any wrongdoing the issue will be handled with fairness
597593 it definitely goes on the list of my favorite places to play
597594 we play a number of those wpa national recovery act theaters and venues
597595 i like playing those and thinking about how they were get the nation back to work kinds of things
597596 its amazing to play those places because theyre often in remarkable places theres also something about the fdr era the thought of how and why they were built and the gangs of unemployed people being rounded up and brought out there to build these places
597597 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere the australian quoted professor mallavarapu as saying
597598 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
597599 i am seriously jealous that you got to suck those tits when you were a baby
597600 well at least you got to suck your dads tit
597601 they thought i was possessed by a dick devil or something
597602 i tell ya its like having two cocks if one of your cocks could kill somebody
597603 im not the rene who changed the lyrics to the national anthem
597604 i was really scared for my life with some of the phone calls and e mails i received
597605 its just unfortunate that now when people hear that name they do think its me
597606 is a model of community listening it explores what it is like to be an african american youth in this particular time and culture and what that means with media with messaging and with gangs and our third act is all about solutions

597608 the effect of gamma rays on man in the moon marigolds
597609 you look at shows like the sopranos which took a huge amount of time off before it returned stronger than ever
597610 or something like the dark knight which got re conceived and relaunched the batman franchise to the highest numbers of any film in history and we believe heroes is that show we think heroes has an audience that loves it and is going to return but we think we have an opportunity to expand that audience too
597611 go back and talk about it and say its better than ever
597612 were getting back to more action and adventure and those wonderful cliffhangers
597613 the storytelling is really heightened and its really fun and a lot of the main characters are back working together again
597614 shes starting to spread her wings and fighting to break away from her domineering father and shes starting to succeed at that
597615 if you dont know exactly what happened i think youre ok you dont need to remember
597616 but what well do is what everyone in this situation does you go and look for the stories around the olympics that you can get access to and this time around they may be as interesting as the olympics themselves
597617 the biggest reward we could receive is to see a psychopath like yourself behind bars
597618 i like being a character actor in aspen because nowhere else is as beautiful and i can finally put all those voices in my head to good use
597619 breckenridge has a strong community base and unwavering support for the arts its a top notch place to perform and see a show

597621 whats great about cripple creek is you get big time entertainment with small town charm we have some of the strongest young actors from across the country and it really makes performing and directing here a joy in addition to the museums casinos and gold mine tours we have a wandering herd of wild donkeys
597622 this company excels at creating a tight knit theater family and it produces bold innovative theatre
597623 between the view the good weather the wildlife and the good nature of all the people i have a hard time remembering im here to work
597624 like if pitchfork comes around and says your band is awesome you suddenly do become awesome
597625 my favorite shows are definitely at rhinoceropolis there is a real cool following that i have here of kids who go totally crazy whenever i play here
597626 its mostly progressive art made by up and coming talent
597627 health was cool enough to name drop myself and rhinoceropolis on pitchfork they did an interview and said this was their favorite place to play and that i was their favorite person to play with we definitely saw a difference just after them saying that
597628 denver itself has this weird sort of lack of national attention were sort of unknown i feel like were our own little creative island that is breeding its own sound or style everyone has always said about denver its gonna blow up its gonna blow up it never does
597629 the recording aspect of it is this strange ghetto rigged creative process that i have
597630 my room is a mess of wires and cables its a weird creative process of me tinkering around on my keyboards and synthesizer and stuff and seeing what happens and making this impromptu song
597631 since i cant play everything live i have to play a backing track on an ipod and then i play over top of that but even then its this in the moment kind of thing i dont even rehearse that much i play the songs differently every time live
597632 i brought a drum set and wrapped it all in saran wrap
597633 i had this big poster and i wore this blanket over my head and beat these drums in this steady rhythm for like 15 minutes when i stopped nobody knew what to do
597634 denver to me is a really special community i think there are a lot of really creative and positive things going on here that are definitely unique to our city that cant really be found elsewhere
597635 it is essential to lay the foundation of the bangsamoro homeland in order to address the bangsamoro peoples humanitarian and economic needs as well as their political aspirations
597636 if a peace agreement is reached that would send a positive signal
597637 but we dont have confidence of continuity of rules laws regulations they seem to be changed more or less at will and this makes investment very difficult
597638 weve been investing in companies globally but we need to get even more feet on the ground in china and india
597639 the system level aspect of cloud computing is thus far inadequately understood so thats where we see our niche
597640 the fact that this show has such a large following in australia and worldwide means people always have an attachment
597641 any show with a large following will have fans that feel ownership of the characters
597642 the key to our deal with production company reveille and nbc is that we are not endemol or granada with 400 different formats
597643 program creators gina riley and jane turner and i regard this as our family business and we are very protective of that
597644 in america just like in australia more adult age children are living with their parents its a phenomenon
597645 we are big believers that comedy takes time to develop
597646 we would love it hit out of the park but we know these things take time
597647 im looking for growth areas and trying to find who the beneficiaries are within that

597654 we are happy to be together working for peace again
597655 its very essential very important because one if they know the problem of the rebels they know the systems that go with that
597656 im not taking them to that because it might be misinterpreted as much as possible i will not let them do that
597657 everything needs to be ready to go on friday the 8th
597658 the logistical preparations are so detailed and significant in everything from transportation to badge accreditation that the sheer volume of activity is astounding
597659 lenovo is in the middle of most of it with 600 technicians supporting computing technology in 54 venues in seven cities
597660 the assignment makes me a huge believer in video chat
597661 talking to my family for 10 minutes right before i eat breakfast which is when theyre eating dinner makes my workday in beijing and my home in chapel hill feel a lot more connected
597662 dedicated and hard charging in the best sense of the word he lived up to the dream of serving his country serving his county and honoring his family
597663 the best detectives in our police department are handling this case
597664 tragic events like these remind us that simply being a law enforcement officer in los angeles is an act of bravery
597665 was an overreaction we think this is a strong institution
597666 its completely unprecedented to put a college on probation where there was no previous indication the college was in trouble
597667 were still completely perplexed why the college was singled out
597668 hes done a very good job as far as moving ahead on lot of different fronts
597669 but weve put a lot of time money and effort into strengthening it
597670 we felt the college was making serious progress but its being faulted
597671 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
597672 sun continues to restructure and focus on cost cutting which we think will result in improved profitability when demand improves
597673 being a woman and a minority theres definitely a lot of challenges the organization as a whole is predominantly male
597674 i had to kind of forge my path on my own
597675 we did blasting all through the night on the large rocks in the mud pile and were continuing to do that
597676 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
597677 sun continues to restructure and focus on cost cutting which we think will result in improved profitability when demand improves
597678 one concern people in our community have is that our infrastructure is not as developed as it could be
597679 this national recognition says we are no longer an invisible community
597680 it says we have a presence in this country and are contributing to its cultural and social fabric
597681 as the city moves into the 21st century as a global city a pacific rim city its important to preserve and promote our historic ethnic cultures and economically revitalize our communities
597682 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
597683 in some parts much of africa for a start homosexual and lesbian relations are a taboo in others the united states for example it has become a justice issue
597684 working on something that will have acceptance by the majority of the churches of the communion we will have to make space for those who cant sign up yet

597703 i am happy to say that tickets for the 2008 olympic games go on sale globally today
597704 we will ensure that the ticket sale takes place in an efficient fair and open manner
597705 there are more than 200 countries with national olympic committees who are eligible to apply for tickets
597706 after they get their allocation it is up to them to determine how they distribute their tickets
597707 to offer the largest number of people the opportunity to watch the olympic games bocog will limit the number of tickets each individual may purchase

597713 prime healthcare services is investing millions of dollars in paradise valley hospital to improve operational efficiencies
597714 it is true that burn centers can be costly to maintain
597715 the care and treatment they provide is indeed highly specialized
597716 the supplies such as cadaver skin and biological dressings as well as the equipment hydrotherapy rooms hyperbaric chambers are expensive
597717 prime healthcare services has made a substantial financial commitment to keep the world renowned burn center open at all costs
597718 what has happened is that most burn centers are in county or university hospitals where heart and brain surgeries get the money
597719 the new pacs at huntington beach hospital is an example of commitment to the hospital and the community it serves to improve the infrastructure and update the equipment with state of the art technology that helps in proving high quality patient care
597720 prime healthcare services phs is investing millions of dollars in huntington beach hospital to improve operational efficiencies
597721 huntington beach hospital has embraced the most modern pacs technology which will dramatically enhance our level of care and the overall service we provide fundamentally integradweb pacs represents a revolutionary change in the way we practice radiology
597722 this is part of their negotiating tactics and frankly im flabbergasted that a tax exempt insurance company is trying to destroy a san diego community asset
597723 if true the allegations would represent very serious violations and a grossly inappropriate strategy to coerce the hospital to accept unfair contract terms
597724 releasing newbluefx for apple final cut pro represents the culmination of a year long product rollout we are thrilled to enter the mac market and count final cut pro among the vital editing platforms we support
597725 i am going to fall the high could never have lasted this long so why try when its impossible to fly
597726 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
597727 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
597728 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
597729 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
597730 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
597731 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
597732 hes thumbing his nose at the managed care plans and insurance companies
597733 since reddys hospitals dont have any contracts hes able to get premium reimbursement rates for cases that come through the emergency department
597734 the contract with the three hospitals was particularly lucrative to us it may affect our bottom line its hard to predict
597735 in india doctors are the no 1 profession and a cardiologist is considered top
597736 since prem reddy came into chino our level of care has improved
597737 were more timely were more efficient and were more cost efficient its always been kind of an urban legend that someone could do this
597738 we dont transfer the patient to other hospitals if we can provide the service i wont do it for the convenience or financial reasons of the health plans
597739 it may result in more money its an unintended consequence sometimes doing the right thing is the best thing for the patients and finances
597740 the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 1 6 billion dollars
597741 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
597742 the second phase is iraq there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
597743 iraq behind us anthrax outbreaks pentagon hardliners press for strikes on saddam
597744 american investigators probing anthrax outbreaks in florida and new york believe they have all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack and have named iraq as prime suspect as the source of the deadly spores their inquiries are adding to what us hawks say is a growing mass of evidence that saddam hussein was involved possibly indirectly with the 11 september hijackers
597745 according to sources in the bush administration investigators are talking to egyptian authorities who say members of the al qaida network detained and interrogated in cairo had obtained phials of anthrax in the czech republic last autumn mohamed atta is said by us intelligence officials to have met in prague an agent from iraqi intelligence called ahmed samir al ahani a former consul later expelled by the czechs for activities not compatible with his diplomatic mission
597746 it was confirmed yesterday that jim woolsey cia director from 1993 to 1996 recently visited london on behalf of the hawkish defence department to firm up other evidence of iraqi involvement in 11 september some observers fear linking saddam to the terrorist attacks is part of an agenda being driven by us hawks eager to broaden the war to include iraq a move being resisted by the british government
597747 u s officials let saddam know during the gulf war that if he used such agents against u s forces he would get a destructive response
597748 but that doesnt mean he or his agents might not want to unleash the weapon from a deniable distance or via third parties his anti american animus hasnt lessened since his gulf defeat and czech government sources have reported that atta the hijacking mastermind met at least once with iraqi diplomat ahmad samir al ani in prague
597749 what weve got to be certain about above all is whether it came from a country supporting these terrorists as a matter of policy such as iraq which we know has made this stuff and theres a credible report not fully verified that they may indeed have given anthrax to exactly the group that did the world trade center its possible that many months ago anthrax a small quantity of it was handed over in prague to mohamed atta and the person who handed it over in prague was an iraqi
597750 in order to find evidence of what wolfowitz and his boss defense secretary donald rumsfeld believed to be true that saddam hussein had close ties to al qaeda and that iraq had an enormous arsenal of chemical biological and possibly even nuclear weapons that threatened the region and potentially the united states
597751 i am a healer a challenger i am a maverick
597752 there isnt anybody like prem reddy that can face so many challenges in the medical field
597753 somewhere along the line the insurance industry has gone bad

597775 if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands
597776 for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me
597777 and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt
597778 if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things and no man hath ascended up to heaven
597779 for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation
597780 men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day
597781 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
597782 consider and hear me o lord my god lighten mine eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death
597783 for david after he had served his own generation by the will of god fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption
597784 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope
597785 for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known
597786 job awaited the call of the trumpet at the rapture thousands of years before it was generally known as doctrine
597787 then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it
597788 and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was buried
597789 and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom
597790 and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame
597791 but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thence
597792 then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my fathers house for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment
597793 but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection
597794 behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed 1st corinthians 15 51 52
597795 lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise physically incorruptible first then we which are physically alive and remain in our natural bodies shall be caught up together with them changed and incorruptible in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord
597796 shit not at 3 dollars a gallon gonna have to be a skate by
597797 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
597798 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
597799 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
597800 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
597801 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
597802 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
597803 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
597804 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
597805 i thought we had enough chances to win the game
597806 in the three times weve played here this is the most chances weve created here if we finished them i think we win the game
597807 what hurt us the most actually though was losing chad marshall and losing brad evans to injuries
597808 that dictates what you can do tactically that limits the decisions you can make
597809 we were missing some players who went to the olympics like robbie rogers and frankie for having five yellows but we played well
597810 they scored on us when we made mistakes and we couldnt finish
597811 i thought they finished their chances well in the first half
597812 they had a little bit of help by an error on the first goal by andy iro missing the header error on the second goal by andrew peterson getting caught in possession that deep and they buried them
597813 i think we had personality but unfortunately we had defensive errors and they scored on us twice
597814 our team looked for the ball a lot we looked to get aggressive in their end we had offensive opportunities but we couldnt take advantage of them
597815 what we talked about with coach at halftime was to be more offensive have more personality in the front to try to look for space and look for the goal opportunities in the second half
597816 when the game was almost over we pushed and our midfielders were more offensive but unfortunately we couldnt score a goal things just simply didnt go our way today
597817 we had a couple of opportunities to score a goal but then they scored their second goal
597818 we kept on trying but their goalkeeper was playing very well

597835 we need to begin the withdrawal immediately in order to force the sunnis shiites and kurds to make decisions on oil sharing and governance and then need to withdraw the rest as prudently as possible

597880 we all have this fatal tendencey at times to exagerrate the faults of others while minimizing the gravity of our own

597882 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in christ jesus
597883 love is patient and kind love does not envy or boast it is not arrogant or rude it does not insist on its own way it is not irritable or resentful it does not rejoice at wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth love bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things
597884 anyone who does not love does not know god because god is love

597911 treating the petition for rehearing en banc as a petition for panel rehearing the petition for panel rehearing is denied
597912 the court having been polled at the request of one of the members of the court and a majority of the judges who are in regular active service and not disqualified not having voted in favor the petition for rehearing en banc is denied
597913 what that means is that by my count 10 of the judges voted against the rehearing and eight voted for it
597914 the no votes would include any of the eligible judges who didnt want to take a position one way or the other theyre then automatically counted as votes not to rehear the case

597968 qualora dovesse capitarmi per le mani qualcosa che non ha il classico formato a4 del raccoglitore come per esempio un articolo di un giornale che potrebbe essere pi largo o pi alto di un foglio a4 oppure come un appunto o una cartolina che potrebbero essere pi piccoli di un a4 io li incollo su un foglio a4 bianco
597969 the measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with but whether its the same problem you had last year
597970 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
597971 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
597972 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
597973 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
597974 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
597975 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
597976 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
597977 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
597978 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
597979 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
597980 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
597981 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
597982 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
597983 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
597984 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
597985 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
597986 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
597987 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
597988 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
597989 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
597990 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
597991 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
597992 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
597993 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
597994 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
597995 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
597996 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
597997 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
597998 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
597999 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
598000 they were filming in johnnys local and everyone was stunned to see him

598006 for the last year or so one of the questions ive been asked again and again has been
598007 although microsoft may claim otherwise vista from both from a technical and business point of view is proving to be a failure
598008 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
598009 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
598010 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
598011 there are no words to express the depth of our gratitude to all our caring and compassionate supporters
598012 the incredible generosity shown by our community tonight is truly staggering and truly inspiring
598013 the contributions from our wonderful friends around the world will help chabad continue our vital mission of reaching out to those in need there are no words to express the depth of our gratitude to all our caring and compassionate supporters

598024 i am not going to apologize for something the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china chinese authorities are running the internet in china
598025 i always said very clearly that i would take and announce a decision after beijing because this is the last year of my mandate
598026 have i been able to contribute to the olympic values
598027 these are 17 cheats that will not falsify the competition this is a deliberate action and i am glad to see a successful one
598028 financially the ioc is very good we have 40 per cent more revenue than in the former olympiad we can redistribute that at a level of 94 per cent

598032 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
598033 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
598034 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
598035 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
598036 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
598037 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
598038 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
598039 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
598040 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
598041 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
598042 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
598043 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
598044 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
598045 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
598046 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
598047 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
598048 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
598049 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
598050 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

598055 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
598056 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
598057 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
598058 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
598059 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
598060 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
598061 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
598062 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
598063 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
598064 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

598079 we do live far apart from each other but lest not forget the bond we had such strength within each other
598080 just how does a guy like me talk to a girl beautiful
598081 so you packed your things and you headed out west i for one wish you the best while i wish you well youll be gone awhile i cant sit here with my hands idle
598082 a big wonderful city of hopes and dreams 187 yeah besides that
598083 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
598084 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
598085 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
598086 the civil aviation safety authority has been in there looking at their handling of recent incidents weve been looking at their performance in general we completed an audit in june and weve found no evidence of any problems or shortcomings within the airline
598087 cleary theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
598088 there are signs that the economy is slowing but there are still lots of strong features of the australian economy theres still lots of reasons why we are in good shape compared with all the other major economies in the world
598089 we had a situation where it was over heating where government spending was growing too fast we had inflation at a 16 year high the former government was not investing in skills and infrastructure
598090 but its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
598091 that will keep the economy ticking along reasonably well in my view
598092 i know ive been mistaken but just give me a break and see the changes that ive made ive got some imperfections but how can you collect them all and throw them in my face
598093 why cant you just forgive me i dont want to relive all the mistakes ive made along the way
598094 do you guys wanna watch def leppard because ill go watch with you if you want too
598095 bj i was in the runaways an all girl rock group they were horrible to us girls werent supposed to play rock and roll girls werent supposed to play guitars or be into sex we pissed off the guys we pissed off the feminists
598096 i still have the 23 rejection letters i received from labels when i first started none of them thought bad reputation or i love rock and roll could be a hit they told me i should put down the guitar and just sing
598097 i sometimes think i should watch my swearing when kids are in the audience but then i think fuck it its a rock and roll show you wanna bring your 8 year old to a rock show then your kid is gonna hear the word fuck
598098 fuck that i play rock and roll i never play clean

598104 but the biggest mistake i made is the one that most of us make while doing this i did not live in the moment enough this is particularly clear now that the moment is gone captured only in photographs there is one picture of the three on them sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing set on a summer day ages 6 4 and 1 and i wish i could remember what we ate and what we talked about and how they sounded and how they looked when they slept that night i wish i had not been in a hurry to get on to the next things dinner bath book bed i wish i had treasured the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less

598148 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
598149 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
598150 very important that the fbi present their case against bruce and not just state that the investigation was over because it was him and hes gone
598151 im concerned about what closing this case without conclusive evidence might do to harm our life sciences enterprise i think we as americans need to see the proof
598152 its a shame the man is not here with us we might have known more
598153 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure

598160 free up parts of the valuable broadcast spectrum for public safety communications such as police fire departments and rescue squads
598161 prevent the use of recovered spectrum for any public safety service
598162 there to take statements but the bp was running the show
598163 border patrol agent tope discussed the incident with other agents before he gave his statement to the police
598164 arriving at the scene as chaotic were numerous agents and police officers were inside the crime scene area
598165 voiced concerns about having the agents the six agents at the scene at the time of the shooting interviewed by eppd and suggested that the fbi be present at the interviews
598166 discussion about the procedure for conducting the interviews went on for about an hour and a half
598167 this was contrary to caps customary procedure of taking the shooters statement on a confession form
598168 the teams operational responsibilities include identifying documenting and securing evidence safeguarding the scene by sealing it off limiting access via a manned single entry and exit point keeping a record of those who are granted access and identifying and separating witnesses
598169 the shortcomings of the investigation are not inconsequential and do not create confidence in border patrol managements policy decisions
598170 this case turns on the state of mind of border patrol agent billings at the instant prior to the shooting

598177 as many families find themselves squeezed by the national economy with increasing prices for food gasoline and other necessities our tax holiday offers consumers a chance for some real savings
598178 well still have tv ads and radio ads and all that kind of stuff
598179 but the thing thats maybe different about what were doing is were very focused on communities and people talking to other people in their own communities
598180 its getting close enough that a national trend or a stumble by republicans or a brilliant move by the democrats could turn it into a toss up
598181 the job here is to get as many volunteers as possible and to get out the vote
598182 were doing the same things but on a grander scale
598183 i would definitely say theres an unprecedented amount of attention being paid to the race on our side because its competitive
598184 i imagine that my watering system is not new to everyone
598185 i suspect that others are probably doing it but i dont know any
598186 when i was in the textile industry we had large air conditioning units that weighed about 3 tons
598187 at j p stevens we started reclaiming the water that came through the ac and then pumped it back into the system so that we didnt lose as much water
598188 our groundwater level hasnt really raised that much this summer our lake has filled up but our groundwater is still low
598189 the water from the tap takes a whole lot of work to put on the tomato plants and its labor intensive because of how often you have to water
598190 im not interested in a 1 or 2 percentage point drop in the achievement gap over a two year time frame i really want to close the achievement gap
598191 ive never seen a superintendent that has the courage to do that
598192 that would be the board saying this is what we want you to do which would give them an out and they would only do those things
598193 its not simple enough to say well have zero tolerance of any misbehavior
598194 in my mind we dont know what those jobs are going to be for the next generation
598195 you almost need to be able to prepare for the unknown
598196 im interested in learning more about mission possible and learning why the decisions were made the way they were made
598197 i dont know enough to know if it is a real issue or a perceived issue
598198 i try to educate them and they help me learn as well

598217 it allows you to see what the needs of a community are and where there are some shortfallings
598218 it adds some legitimacy behind the cause of keeping young professionals in the area
598219 i feel i can be just as much or more of a contributing member back doing this than going and volunteering every saturday morning
598220 i was really looking forward to the opportunity to be with some professionals and be empowered by using our own money to add to the community
598221 i was already contributing to other nonprofits and such but didnt have as much of a hand as i do in future fund in directing where those funds go
598222 you can walk around town now and point to things the future fund has done
598223 that really gave us a huge advantage in getting started and set that momentum
598224 once we sent all that information out it snowballed without that initial grant it would have taken more time
598225 it has become a full fledged operation in about one tenth of the time i expected
598226 most grant making organizations will not make a grant to a nonprofit until its already up and running with financial statements and can put on a good presentation
598227 the future fund is one of the few organizations in town that will take a leap of faith and do some risky grants
598228 a lot of people would say 100 for a rain barrel thats nothing this is a neighborhood where that 100 needs to be used for something else
598229 we could have done part of the program but we would have had to have people pay for their own barrels
598230 probably only a fraction of the number of barrels that will end up in the neighborhood would have been purchased
598231 membership at this young professional age level can put their finger on what theyre doing to help the community
598232 as a young person youre not going to have that access outside the future fund the way you have it in the future fund

598240 i didnt want to do it for a certain person just for the lord ive hurt so many people in my lifetime and took so much that i felt i had to give
598241 he said you know ive got to make these hands work for god

598260 the scenery around chicago creates the opportunity for tv to get these incredible shots like when you watch a baseball game at wrigley field
598261 in beijing theres nothing immediately around the olympic venues that will give you that stunning quality
598262 our marketing efforts should be that the iconic structures are already here and the olympics will benefit from them

598279 its acoustic and upbeat but at the same time its laid back contemporary
598280 it is on pastor mcgees heart to provide the opportunity to experience an environment where people can practically learn the bible no matter their background
598281 i went to the thursday night bible study and was amazed how practical the book of leviticus was
598282 as i began to apply the bible to my life i ended up going into the ministry

598292 we suspect that after coming up with either no clear evidence of organic materials or only contradictory inconclusive evidence the phoenix researchers will nonetheless claim the ice discovery as a major find related to martian habitability which will in turn lead to future probes and an ever continuing search for life on the planet the question we politely and rhetorically submit is what evidence could nasa find that would completely quell evolutionists hopes for life on mars

598323 marry strong marketable elements with something a bit more cinematic and with pretensions to being intelligent or arty cinema
598324 as youre probably aware when youre trying to get three or four million out of somebody youve got a lot of hoops to jump through and a lot of d to suck and all that sort of thing im pretty good at doing that shit because of having made three films out in the cold
598325 so i was able to respond to peoples criticisms and do a little bit of my own tweaking having made three films before i realised that a script is a blueprint for something else not a work in its own right im prepared for scripts to radically transform during the making of a film for me its essential
598326 ive always wanted to be inside the monster and ive been able to deliver the film that i wanted to deliver which is a teen chiller but that doesnt patronise its target audience who are teenagers
598327 looking at it from afar obviously this is the genre year of the festival theres definitely something in the zeitgeist
598328 i think whats happened in the last few years is that perhaps the mainstream financing apparatus in australia has become a tiny bit more inclined to finance something that might be seen as a genre film which acolytes is basically if wolf creek hadnt have occurred theres no way acolytes would have gotten into production in australia
598329 look basically i have my own films that im still trying to make my niche is as a low budget filmmaker who writes produces directs and markets their own product
598330 but you know if somebody called me up and said were interested in you directing halloween 10 im there im doing it ill do anything because no matter what the project is theres always the opportunity to try and turn what youre working on into your own film
598331 to a degree ive done that with acolytes and im pretty happy with the result
598332 ive made the film for a 15 to 18 year old demographic and i absolutely want to target that but i dont know if distributors and exhibitors are quite on the ball making value judgements about that audience
598333 generally movies made for that audience just come down the pipe from hollywood they just get put on and theyre successful or theyre not
598334 so with us being an aussie film aiming at that demographic which is the movie going demographic i think theres still a few people who have to get their heads around a proper release pattern
598335 im from exhibition and distribution i was releasing films in the early 1980s in melbourne and all across australia and the unfortunate thing that i noticed is that aussie films today are still being released in pretty much the same way that they were in 1985 nothing has really changed
598336 thats one of the reasons perhaps why australian films dont achieve as much success as they might at the box office im not laying the blame on exhibitors and distributors but thats sort of what im up against with acolytes
598337 belinda and i are a partnership we write together and weve had success at being paid to write scripts none of which have been made but weve had some degree of success there but belindas also a working actor who manages to survive
598338 ive always been a graphic designer ive always had a day job which is a sensible thing for any filmmaker in australia to have so broadly speaking when im not making films im doing graphic design and whatever other shit kicking work i can get

598357 heres my news tip for boise especially any elected or wannabe soon to be elected officials laserjets and dram are not going to carry the valley like they once did can we expect to see more layoffs in boise its too hard to realistically predict any specific events tied to any specific market activity maybe not now maybe not in the 100s or 1 000s at a time but over time we will see continued adjustments as business and economic situations change unless hp or micron invest in new industries and actually base them out of boise we will see continual attrition or more likely theyll go out of state boise has very few solid medium sized businesses here mpc has been limping along for longer than most people thought they would we need a good base of medium sized businesses to support our economy and in another 5 10 years replace the growth that micron and hp brought here during the 80s and 90s bvep will never get a medium sized business to relocate to the boise valley however if i were mayor beiter governor otter or the head of bvep i wouldnt be wasting my time and taxpayer dollars going to cuba over and over again without anything to show for it id be in the lobby of microsoft and sun microsystems every month doing whatever i could to encourage them to not only keep their newly acquired boise presence but expand here weve got this great complex or two by the river on park center no one is currently using imnho in my never humble opinion our best bet is to start investing in our local small technology focused businesses and by investing i dont mean handouts i mean giving them the real resources they need well educated college graduates which starts at high school now a good statewide infrastructure that includes roads and broadband and a local government that gets it and can evangelize for them local tech companies provide the best opportunity for growth with the least amount of investment local tech companies dont need any tax breaks to be here they already made that decision todays tech companies dont consume major amounts or electricity and water todays tech companies provide an average wage that makes the average wage at micron laughable and finally todays tech companies provide their employees the skills to go off and start other tech companies not go off and work in a call center
598358 and the fact that every comp sci grad from bsu has on average 3 job offers before graduation and many leave the state definitely highlights a critical need to increase the supply of highly trained local tech workers youre correct in asserting that this should start at the high school level if not sooner
598359 my mother could not go and vote in the united states of america the place of her birth but you dont understand and i what you to to understand the frustration that goes along with when you say we live in the same world it isnt balanced and we would like it to be you have to listen you have to understand the fact that we are trying to tell you that there are issues there are huge problems that you got to know if you want to know us etc

598372 it was essentially like you had to pay the maximum toll twice

598385 was forced to witness and commit acts completely contrary to his nature and returned a tormented confused disillusioned shadow of his former self that was not being given the help he needed

598415 all the talk is over beckys playing for russia right now and were taking care of our business
598416 i think a lot of it has been the media in the states making it a lot bigger than it is

598424 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
598425 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
598426 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury

598432 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
598433 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
598434 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
598435 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
598436 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
598437 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
598438 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
598439 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
598440 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
598441 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
598442 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
598443 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
598444 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
598445 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
598446 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
598447 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
598448 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist

598452 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
598453 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
598454 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
598455 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
598456 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all

598470 i am confident talks with chelsea will lead to a positive resolve about my future
598471 theres no dialogue between rangers and fulham at the moment but there is money left over to buy players on top of bougherra kenny miller kyle lafferty and andrius velicka
598472 what youre looking for is good value in terms of transfer fee and wages
598473 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have
598474 we are looking for someone very physical who can play as a wide striker
598475 for me it is different because the boss is french and he brought me here i dont know many managers in football but i think he is one of the best
598476 to work with a manager like him and players like cesc and robin we are all around 22 to 25 and it is a dream to play for arsenal
598477 if a championship outfit like palace dont receive satisfaction what chance do wycombe wanderers have
598478 as a fellow investor i like simon jordan would be devastated if we produced an outstanding talent only to have to let him go for a fraction of his worth through the tribunal system
598479 i dont know because ive asked phil gartside bolton chairman and hes not aware of it and im not aware of it i presume it is our kevin davies
598480 weve not had anything other than a conversation a month ago of you wouldnt sell kevin would you
598481 kevin i believe in the next 24 to 48 hours will be signing a new deal to put another year on to his contract hopefully
598482 ive played three games of the pre season so far and weve won them all and it was especially pleasing to beat celtic because they won their league
598483 bentys confidence keeps growing and i was also very happy for david bentley to score in his first game
598484 brad friedel made his debut and though he didnt need a penalty save to prove hes a class goalkeeper his overall performance was really very commanding and so assured i think that given an injury free run he will do well for us
598485 it was very good for us to see some of the younger players in action and a chance for some of the older players who didnt get a game last weekend to play
598486 ngog showed his quality and i always say the same our scout department is working really hard to find young players at a good price hopefully it will be the first of many goals
598487 i think there are two very important things about this draw
598488 firstly the second game is at home which is really really important
598489 im also pleased because the travelling isnt a problem we dont have to go too far which is good news especially when you look at some of the teams we could have drawn
598490 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect we know some things about their team already but we will now watch more videos and get reports from our scouts before the first game
598491 of course we know about oguchi onyewu because he spent some time with newcastle
598492 it is an exciting signing everyone is talking about him
598493 hes a talented kid hes a skilful player im sure hell excite the fans
598494 getting him here excites me and shows the kind of football im looking to play at blackburn
598495 the biggest reward we could receive is to see a psychopath like yourself behind bars
598496 if you ask me what kind of image i want
598497 all the time he tried to poison my mind on anwars character he claimed to know anwar inside out
598498 i joined umno because of anwar ibrahim and left umno because of anwar ibrahim

598514 you learn to live around this hole in your life

598528 last november december it wouldnt have taken much to blow the economy over the edge now here it is july and nothing much has changed were sort of stuck in a traffic jam and everyone wonders how long are we going to be here

598532 banks were making mortgages that they probably shouldnt have made and people took out mortgages that they shouldnt have taken
598533 now with housing prices falling theres nowhere to fund consumption
598534 the ripple effects of high crude oil have put a squeeze on manufacturers who are forced to increase prices to consumers at a time when consumers have less money to spend because of the costs of gasoline and everything made from petroleum
598535 its difficult for the fed to know what to do
598536 does it raise interest rates and stem inflation or does it again lower rates to try to stimulate the economy i think we may be looking at stagflation
598537 the fed has few options its wrapped up right now trying to save the financial system
598538 the fed in effect has nationalized the american financial system
598539 if gasoline dropped that would break part of the psychology that we talked ourselves into this situation

598542 and we all can learn something from horses as you step out of your world into the world of a horse you may begin to question old behaviors and perceptions

598544 are super sensitive to the energy of the kids once we had a little boy who was hyperactive and couldnt focus in school he ran up to a round pen and one of the miniature horses got scared and began running in circles and continued for several minutes

598546 because our therapy programs are so rewarding and fun we have adapted them as programs for all ages

598548 to support access to equine and other animal assisted therapeutic and educational services that foster strength empowerment and resiliency
598549 horses live in the moment theyre constant learners and they dont forget the children
598550 this all about building community it really does take a village to raise a child
598551 weve seen kids here who are autistic learning disabled children who have behavior problems who are homeless and had some very difficult family situations when i see the difference we can make in a life its all worth it to me

598626 the system level aspect of cloud computing is thus far inadequately understood so thats where we see our niche
598627 you know i went to ntuc to buy fish to cook for you but in the end cannot cook dont sorry me
598628 these the firebombing of dresden and nuclear attacks on nagasaki and hiroshima were catastrophic acts committed under the necessity of defeating barbarism but man is not equally culpable and history not a record of symmetry in brutality it merely seemed that way to a particular generation at a historical moment the vietnam war
598629 the sandinista dictatorship of nicaragua with full cuban soviet bloc support not only persecutes its people the church and denies a free press but arms and provides bases for communist terrorists attacking neighboring states support for freedom fighters is self defense and totally consistent with the oas and u n charters
598630 this is not however just americas fight and what is at stake is not just americas freedom this is the worlds fight
598631 if terrorism is the massacre of innocents to break the will of rulers were not hiroshima and nagasaki terrorism on a colossal scale
598632 along with this is the belief that the pax romana americana is the only
598633 would you give a man who broke into your house destroyed the place raped and killed your family just for something valuable a timetable for withdrawal
598634 in 1981 sen published poverty and famines an essay on entitlement and deprivation a book in which he demonstrated that famine occurs not only from a lack of food but from inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food sens interest in famine stemmed from personal experience as a nine year old boy he witnessed the bengal famine of 1943 in which three million people perished this staggering loss of life was unnecessary sen later concluded he believed that there was an adequate food supply in india at the time but that its distribution was hindered because particular groups of people in this case rural labourers lost their jobs and therefore their ability to purchase the food in his book poverty and famines an essay on entitlement and deprivation 1981 sen revealed that in many cases of famine food supplies were not significantly reduced in bengal for example food production whilst down on the previous year was higher than in previous non famine years thus sen points to a number of social and economic factors such as declining wages unemployment rising food prices and poor food distribution systems these issues led to starvation among certain groups in society his positive freedom a persons actual ability to be or do something rather than on negative freedom approaches which are common in economics and simply focuses on non interference in the bengal famine rural laborers negative freedom to buy food was not affected however they still starved because they were not positively free to do anything they did not have the functioning of nourishment nor the capability to escape morbidity
598635 the famine only began to approach indias year in year out toll in proportionate terms of infant mortality and deaths from malnutrition or starvation which i only mention because the medias recent habit of depicting kim jung ils frolicking among a heap of starved cadavers
598636 i have no respect for a man who starves his own people
598637 we banqueted with kim and a group of grumpy old men outside the people starved
598638 flood and drought have hit south korea too some people drowned and more lost property yet nobody starved that is the difference between sensible socio economic systems efficient and flexible and stupid ones
598639 north korea has relied on foreign aid to feed its people since 1995 when its agricultural system collapsed after decades of mismanagement
598640 but he also urged india to lift caps on foreign investment lower tariffs that penalize american agricultural markets and protect its workers and children from abuses
598641 those who were swept up in rooting for this accomplishment may wake to the reality that this could be a huge fiasco
598642 chinese blocking access to internet media at olympics irked by censorship of unapproved sites
598643 backtracking on another promise about coverage of the beijing games
598644 mapping out a new regulation that we are confident will make chinas media still more open and transparent
598645 we know that the public at large is grieving the loss
598646 at least someone stood up for us and the jury stood up for us
598647 i think weve gotten to the point where we kind of have to force it
598648 hes bright clean conservative but not angry and jewish hes a great fundraiser and locks up virginia for good measure
598649 a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know

598652 operational police communications and as such are not meant for public consumption
598653 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
598654 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
598655 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
598656 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
598657 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
598658 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
598659 special report how the fishing industrys collapse is altering morro bay
598660 san luis obispo should celebrate its loss of the amgen tour
598661 he listened to me for 15 minutes and then quit
598662 i told them they didnt need a bunch of coaches coming over there and giving them pennies
598663 what you need to do is send some kids to the united states get them masters degrees and have them work with the college track program thats the big payoff
598664 i told them they had to get to know who the real players were in track and field and i could help them with that i told them if they put up some money id put up some money and id have the university wsu put up some money and id get li a teaching assistants position
598665 youre telling me john that li interpreted what you were saying for eight straight hours
598666 he not only deserves to be admitted here he deserves a medal
598667 he realized li li was a wonderful name but it didnt fit over here
598668 when he asked me if he could use the name james after my son i just told him its yours now
598669 when he goes over there now hes like a rock star in china for crying out loud
598670 he has been instrumental in setting up our training facilities over there for this olympics so many of the chinese officials went to college with him i dont know what the u s team would have done without james
598671 he is a very smart kid and a hard worker but coaching is all temperament and james has very good temperament i think the fact that he went through the cultural revolution and all that stuff i think he himself had this epiphany and understood what it means to help people
598672 i came in a redheaded guy in miami sunburned like crazy and i was doing the long snapping
598673 one night at dinner they are bringing all this seafood out and he was right behind me youre the red snapper
598674 other than pulling my treadmill into the garage starting the car and hoping i come out two hours later
598675 there isnt really a lot i can do to get ready for it
598676 there was a perfect 300 score at a bowling alley in tustin calif
598677 all the pins in all 30 lanes at strike orange county were toppled at the same time tuesday when the 5 4 magnitude earthquake hit
598678 i dont hang out with the guys never have i dont go out drinking look at porn have a girlfriend or get divorced so im selfish
598679 i dont want to give away too much but it ends with the lighting of a torch
598680 were counting on somebody from that group or a couple of them to step up and play a lot
598681 the receivers have a lot to prove theyre all trying real hard because its so competitive and makes sense that youd see them show at this thing
598682 all of us want to go out and show the coaches we can compete make plays in a real game type environment
598683 all of us are just trying to make a name for ourselves and make a name for our group as a whole
598684 regardless of what the competition is you feel good when you make a play like that
598685 i like this field i could get used to this
598686 i want charlie to play a lot i want to know him better
598687 i wasnt super excited about going back out there and i heard the wind had picked up too
598688 but i figured what the heck we were on a fishing trip
598689 ironically i was thinking that the last time i was on a trip up there this was the same little cove that i caught a tyee salmon of 30 pounds
598690 there was a bunch of boats that had fish on and while i was watching them catch their fish my pole was hit hard and line started to scream off the reel
598691 we knew it was a big fish and it roared out a couple of hundred yards of fishing line
598692 then the fish came running back toward the boat and then it went down and stayed down totally in control of the line
598693 sitting there sweating bullets because it wasnt moving at all
598694 on my god it was just enormous laying there in the water
598695 it was such a long fish they had to adjust the scale so the fin wouldnt touch the ground
598696 my biggest king on the trip was 32 pounds and the rest were in the 20 pound range
598697 i cant brag because it was simply the luck of the draw that the fish chose my line but it will be something that i will always remember
598698 this is the biggest king caught at englefield bay this year
598699 that king was probably headed to one of the big rivers on the mainland coast of british columbia
598700 we are at 20 178 sockeye over tumwater dam and so we are approaching enough to have a fishery
598701 for now though it is still in a wait and see mode we are so close but just not quite there yet
598702 she accepts the fact that the testing was properly done and the results properly reported
598703 i think that if you were to ask anyone at trials what should happen if the first place finisher were to test positive for a banned substance they would tell you that third place would move up
598704 it is clear that along this road from the timing of trials to the usada testing errors were made and at this point no one in the leadership of our sport is acknowledging that
598705 the reality of getting into the pro football hall of fame didnt really hit me till a few days ago
598706 and then to see the magnitude of all of this and all of you its been something amazing
598707 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
598708 both parties are talking the green bay packers and brett
598709 and i think the discussions are moving ahead i would hope that we would have something resolved by monday
598710 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
598711 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially
598712 i think its a disservice when players arent in camp and being paid properly
598713 what smith did was wrong and he is being punished severely for it

598717 therefore i tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe you have received it and it will be yours
598718 and when you stand praying if you hold anything against anyone forgive him her so that your father in heaven may forgive you for your sins
598719 the soul of a civilization is its religion and it dies with its faith
598720 foods particularly eggs and chickens contributed to inflation caused by supply shock as the prices of chicken feeds soared
598721 it will depend on the next five months there will be the fasting month in september idul fitri in october and christmas in december if the government wants to keep inflation at around 11 percent it must keep supply chains
598722 the second round effects of the fuel prices hike surprisingly was seen in july increasing price and shortages of lpg made inflation worse
598723 rumors of a rise in electricity rates and another rise in fuel prices also increased inflation expectations
598724 that poor tortured soul the joker i could work with him hes got potential ok so he has a nasty habit of using pencils as weapons i bet his secret wish is to be a writer maybe i could get him to start journaling or scrapbooking after all hes creative and im deeply attracted to creative types i and i alone could discover the real reason for his scars or at least i could help with his makeup that pancake stuff has got to go
598725 this is all just showboatin see this guy right here you think he can do anything about the economy the economy runs on its own cycles no matter whos in there
598726 the effects of leaders are very strong in autocratic settings but much less so in the presence of democratic institutions
598727 outlined a new process for hiring immigration judges that listed the white house as the sole source for generating candidates
598728 bush gore republican democrat clinton spotted owl abortion gay gun and florida recount
598729 sufficient evidence to have realized that political or ideological affiliations played a role
598730 right now our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind
598731 my job is not to make profits larger although i care about a healthy oil industry
598732 when people say this will have only a nominal impact on prices thats saying we dont have to do anything at all
598733 you have to run hard but you have to run smart so its kind of like theyre holding in the reins just a bit but still letting me race that was absolutely perfect
598734 unless were ahead by 1 701 we cant take anything for granted
598735 because you could blow it over in qualifying i feel confident but not overly so everything has to fall your way on lake washington
598736 sometimes the easiest wins are the hardest thats when the starter falls off the boat
598737 luckily we hit the start ran the laps and didnt hurt the boat we were trying to be conservative nobody remembers what happens in the first heat unless you crash
598738 we had a really good start and we had the inside lane
598739 he kept pushing me trying to make me break or make a mistake but it didnt happen so im really happy
598740 anybody who gets the inside lane is going to be hard to beat
598741 its the shortest way around the course were very confident but i never sell the bears hide until i kill it there are a lot of good teams here
598742 its really nice to see jean come back with his first win after all that repair
598743 i bobbled a little and that gave up whatever little lead i had
598744 you cant bobble at all when someone is inside of you i think we had the straightaway speed
598745 when you have something that is this fast and to have issues come up that are a little different every time so you cant narrow it down is extremely frustrating
598746 theres a hole in a piston on one of the motors we have connecting rods hanging out on two of them and a crankshaft thats locked up on a fourth one
598747 we have more back in the shop and the goal is to get ready for san diego
598748 i feel happy because for sure to be no 1 is hard work from a long long time ago
598749 the way he was playing we all thought he was not going to lose any time soon
598750 im done with all the hoopla and just want to get on with it be here enjoy the moment and make some memories
598751 all the talk is over beckys playing for russia right now and were taking care of our business
598752 i think a lot of it has been the media in the states making it a lot bigger than it is
598753 you know were not really worried about her were worried about russia as a whole if anything its one less player we have to study a lot because we know her game so well playing against her we respect her and her game
598754 i dont think the becky thing is going to be an issue unless it comes down to the medal round during this tournament it doesnt have any kind of hutzpah when it comes down to crunch time if it comes down to winning a gold or silver thats when there will be a little more to it

598762 i had a lot of support and i appreciate all the help
598763 those guys know what theyre doing theyre my security blanket and then there are the receivers the tight ends and the running backs and the coaches too
598764 its all in place now we just have to go out and execute we have to work on the little things we have to get better
598765 we know the talent we have we have expectations to win every game
598766 max expects to throw a touchdown pass every time out
598767 i like it when it bothers him when hes not perfect on the field
598768 hes poised and he has tons of confidence theres no question everybody sees that everybody feels that you take that out on the field especially on the road and it makes it much easier to win
598769 im comfortable and relaxed but i have to get better
598770 there are so many things i have to work on were good but we have a big target on us every week were going to have to come to play i wouldnt have it any other way
598771 im calm but i have a sense of urgency im the exact same on the field as i was last year im competitive im driven i expect to improve and im hungry to win
598772 every cabinet member signed a political contract before taking office and pledged to uphold clean government and good governance
598773 realizing corruption free governance is the presidents main agenda even though the case happened before the two were appointed ministers this is strongly related to the political contract
598774 just let the president hear explanations from the two ministers i dont want to speculate
598775 the president will give them a fair opportunity to explain and defend themselves the president leaves it to legal facts and respects the due process of law but on the other hand this is also about political commitment
598776 the event hamka yandhu described to the court happened before the two paskah and kaban were appointed ministers

598785 much of the difference between countries such as america where entrepreneurship thrives and those where it does not is cultural rather than regulatory she believes in many emerging economies business tends to be dominated by a closed elite hostile to new entrepreneurs and failure is stigmatised rather than being a badge of honour as it is in silicon valley
598786 im a size 16 with cellulite thighs and a stage 4 cancer diagnosis a little anxiety provoking but i did it
598787 one of the most inspirational things ive experienced in my whole life
598788 this has not been an easy year for her but she just focused on crossing that finish line
598789 and thats what life is all about helping each other get to the finish line
598790 it was just perfect to be there and watch her do that shes very brave
598791 i wasnt going for the olympics i was in it for the journey not the destination and i had a great time
598792 this program has been very successful in several new england states in identifying soldiers with readjustment problems and we are happy to expand it to new york
598793 we consider it a real privilege to be able to speak with these soldiers
598794 as with all health problems mental health issues are best dealt with early and close to home offering mental health screenings as part of the reintegration process will lead to early identification and support for those returning soldiers who are struggling to deal with the stresses of deployment and war
598795 i said im delighted to hear how exciting it is but the poster is not all that exciting
598796 the fact that secretariat never won the travers was unknown to me
598797 to someone that doesnt know all those things its very pleasing
598798 i thought well whats the most famous aspect of that race track
598799 if the race produced the best image id do the race itself
598800 this is saratoga i came to understand how rare and unique saratoga is
598801 the markets hate uncertainty so as we get closer to the election any contradictions in the candidates policies can cause anxiety
598802 we tend to see a relief rally after a presidential election no matter what the outcome because there finally is some certainty
598803 it seems obama has a negative slant toward the capital gains structure which he considers too favorable to the affluent so the perception is that will hurt the stock market and investors
598804 meanwhile mccain is trying to raise the estate tax limit and lower the estate tax rate but that has been proposed in congress the last six years and never gone anywhere
598805 in the short run if there is a need after the election for an economic stimulus package mccain or obama would pass one and if there isnt such a need neither would pass one
598806 but looking at the next presidential term major issues such as health care and energy policy must be addressed no matter who wins
598807 i chose oregon because it was the only college that would accept me as a middle linebacker
598808 while dressing for the first practice i thought how strange it was that i was no 75
598809 remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck
598810 the night before the game you get little or no sleep

598828 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
598829 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign was being racist
598830 and i think they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
598831 what im interested in ultimately is going to be governing
598832 what that means is were going to have to try to get things done
598833 theyre very good at negative campaigning theyre not so good at governing
598834 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
598835 as we meet our country is in the sixth year of a two front war our economy is struggling our planet is in peril these challenges and many others demand new leadership

598838 cdcs new incidence estimates reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
598839 there are roughly 225 000 more people living with hiv in the u s than previously suspected
598840 governments to focus on reaching the marginalized populations that are most affected by the epidemic
598841 the shameful reality is that most governments and global health institutions are only now beginning to develop strategies to reach these vulnerable groups
598842 we get fantastic feedback about all of our bands but its the accordionists who get the most comments
598843 because of its inability to protect this project as proposed
598844 one day in the future we may be able to purchase the homes that we now enjoy
598845 mr barker has given us his word that no tenants will be asked to vacate their units and that we may continue to rent and occupy our units for as long as we choose
598846 which will greatly gain from being cleaned up and converting from down scale rentals to moderate permanent housing
598847 we were looking for someone well rounded who exemplified what we thought of kody maldonado when he was here
598848 i just felt so empty after he was gone we really needed to do something to help remember him
598849 what better way to carry on kodys memory than to help another young athlete achieve the many things that kody will not be able to in this life
598850 aprovechemos que nadie sabe lo que paso y pongamos entonces lo que se nos da la gana
598851 it doesnt matter why he did it he did it
598852 wed like to go to home depot to get gardening supplies but its after hours
598853 even more impressive than fryars overflowing talent at using a hedge clipper is his work ethic humility and obvious connection to people
598854 i had no training as a gardener just a 3 minute lesson in topiaries at a nursery but for one time in my life ignorance paid off
598855 through my training in math i can visualize what will be there in seven years i use plants to express my feelings like paint on a canvas
598856 tells the merchant that were serious about no illegal sales and it causes the merchant to be more serious about better training their staff
598857 this guy leads the league in complete games so it wont hurt him at all
598858 our attitude towards other non congress and non bjp parties will be determined by their attitude to the bjp or the congress
598859 our aim is to prevent mayawati from going to the bjp camp
598860 we are putting america at more risk not less risk
598861 i think its an important risk but frankly im more concerned about bombs and guns which are easily available
598862 across the spectrum of biothreats we have expanded our capacity significantly
598863 it was kind of a no brain decision for us
598864 a major reason was to avoid the transportation costs which are terrible
598865 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
598866 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries
598867 you could have a very significant shock to traditional consumption patterns and also some important growth effects
598868 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
598869 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals

599061 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
599062 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
599063 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
599064 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
599065 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021

599082 but i have always been convinced that theres a great movie in this book and this is the one we are going to make
599083 i said from the start if we got the boat right then the rest would fit into place it has to go from being a fishing boat in the first half of the film to a war vessel in the second half it was vital to me that it was genuinely built before the second world war so the hunt was on from the moment we got the go ahead for the movie
599084 its a 38ft american motor cabin cruiser a wooden hull 11 ft beam 3 ft draught a perfect match to the boat hemingway described

599094 in the end i didnt think i could make it as a professional sportsman so i thought that acting could make a great alternative life
599095 its still sport of a kind with winners and losers you also have to be fit to survive its not that first or second part or even big role which is so difficult its maintaining it over years
599096 no im a private person i hate everything about this business that intrudes on my life including these interviews but i do them to promote the movies because it helps people im fond of
599097 there is a terrific battle between an 11 year old boy and a 1 000lb blue marlin which i am looking forward to filming that is when the boat comes into its own
599098 this movie might be set in the past but it is about you and me now
599099 it is not a chick flick not a thriller killer not a quirky romance
599100 i want it to be a really good movie exciting from minute to minute frame to frame this is for people who want to see something different
599101 until youve heard andy debate al gore you havent lived
599102 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
599103 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
599104 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
599105 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
599106 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
599107 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
599108 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
599109 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
599110 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
599111 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
599112 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
599113 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
599114 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
599115 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
599116 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
599117 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
599118 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
599119 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
599120 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
599121 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
599122 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
599123 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
599124 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
599125 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
599126 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
599127 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
599128 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
599129 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
599130 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
599131 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
599132 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
599133 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
599134 i object to the gentleman from california vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes not entitled to vote
599135 cleve youre wrong chet was back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he answered his answer just wasnt heard
599136 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
599137 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
599138 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
599139 you have a talent for leadership bob the country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation
599140 after about a year i became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my membership in the organization during the nine years that have followed i have never been interested in the klan
599141 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia and in every state in the nation
599142 ive always said this document and the holy bible theyve been all the guidance i need
599143 much to be thankful for theres not much i wouldnt do over
599144 we just ask that in the end gods grace shines upon us
599145 he said and taking one hand to steady the other he slowly scratched his name on the gift thank you senator byrd http my barackobama com page community post jefferyfloyd ggbfbb aug 2 2008 at 8 50 pm
599146 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
599147 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
599148 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
599149 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
599150 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
599151 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
599152 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
599153 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
599154 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
599155 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
599156 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
599157 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
599158 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
599159 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
599160 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
599161 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
599162 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
599163 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
599164 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
599165 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
599166 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
599167 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
599168 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
599169 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
599170 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
599171 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
599172 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
599173 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
599174 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
599175 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
599176 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
599177 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
599178 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
599179 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
599180 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
599181 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
599182 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
599183 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
599184 it was an ugly scene with blood everywhere i could not count the dead i just glanced at once and i ran away for my life
599185 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
599186 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
599187 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
599188 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
599189 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
599190 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
599191 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
599192 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
599193 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
599194 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
599195 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
599196 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
599197 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
599198 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
599199 there is not much that evangelicals have in common with the policies promoted by barack obama
599200 despite his best efforts to court people of faith voters understand the difference between lip service and public service and john mccains record is much more in line with the values of the evangelical community
599201 one thing that it clearly is indicative of this poll is that this nation cares about the christian values and ethics of a candidate for national office and it makes enough difference that the news media reports on it
599202 people of faith have always been involved in the political process they have a patriotic and scriptural obligation to do so it is to be ignored at the candidates peril
599203 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
599204 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
599205 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
599206 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
599207 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
599208 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
599209 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
599210 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
599211 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
599212 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
599213 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
599214 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
599215 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
599216 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
599217 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
599218 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
599219 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
599220 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
599221 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
599222 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
599223 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
599224 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
599225 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
599226 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
599227 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
599228 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
599229 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
599230 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
599231 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
599232 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
599233 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
599234 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
599235 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
599236 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
599237 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
599238 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
599239 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
599240 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
599241 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
599242 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
599243 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
599244 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
599245 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
599246 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
599247 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
599248 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
599249 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
599250 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
599251 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
599252 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
599253 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
599254 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
599255 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
599256 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
599257 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
599258 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
599259 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
599260 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
599261 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
599262 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
599263 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
599264 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
599265 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
599266 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
599267 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
599268 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
599269 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
599270 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
599271 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
599272 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
599273 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
599274 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
599275 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
599276 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
599277 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
599278 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
599279 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
599280 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
599281 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
599282 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
599283 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
599284 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
599285 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
599286 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
599287 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
599288 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
599289 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
599290 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
599291 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
599292 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
599293 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
599294 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
599295 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
599296 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
599297 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
599298 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
599299 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
599300 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
599301 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
599302 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
599303 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
599304 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
599305 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
599306 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
599307 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
599308 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
599309 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
599310 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
599311 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
599312 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
599313 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
599314 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
599315 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
599316 we need to reset the bar and change the debate

599321 buying presents to impress women has been a key part of mating rituals in humans for some time but it appears that it is the act of generosity rather than the gift itself which is being used as a mating signal
599322 we have found in previous studies that women are attracted to generous men they seem to like heroic types for short term relationships but altruists for long term relationships
599323 generosity could be a way for men to show their suitability to invest in a relationship and help in rearing offspring

599333 nalini was one of the prime accused in the rajiv gandhi assassination case
599334 no as the real killers sivarasan suba and dhanu were already dead
599335 dhanu a suicide bomber had carried out the attack at sriperumbudur in tamil nadu on the fateful night of may 21 1991 killing rajiv gandhi and 15 others on the spot dhanu perished in the bomb attack
599336 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
599337 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
599338 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
599339 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
599340 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
599341 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
599342 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
599343 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
599344 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
599345 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
599346 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
599347 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
599348 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
599349 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
599350 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
599351 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
599352 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
599353 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
599354 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
599355 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
599356 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
599357 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
599358 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
599359 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
599360 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
599361 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
599362 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
599363 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
599364 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
599365 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
599366 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
599367 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
599368 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
599369 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
599370 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
599371 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
599372 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
599373 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
599374 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
599375 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
599376 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
599377 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
599378 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
599379 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
599380 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
599381 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
599382 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
599383 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
599384 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
599385 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
599386 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
599387 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
599388 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
599389 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
599390 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
599391 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
599392 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
599393 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
599394 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
599395 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
599396 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
599397 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
599398 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
599399 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
599400 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
599401 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
599402 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
599403 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
599404 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
599405 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
599406 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
599407 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
599408 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
599409 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
599410 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
599411 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
599412 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
599413 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
599414 you know its not about you its about your country
599415 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
599416 we are borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
599417 i for one do not believe our country can withstand 10 more years of the status quo
599418 we need to change the debate in this country from what we cant do to what we can america has led every major technological shift in the last 100 years and we can lead the next one as well the problem is not technology it is political will
599419 mr gore has moved a long way from the solutions recommended in
599420 we couldnt come close to his goal of producing all our electricity from solar wind and geothermal energy in 10 years without coercive even authoritarian government
599421 gotta play faster quarterbacks everything has to speed up everything
599422 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
599423 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
599424 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
599425 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
599426 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
599427 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
599428 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
599429 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

599437 it is a lot more likely the government will push even harder behind kingsnorth power station now that the brakes have been put on their nuclear plans
599438 i am deeply concerned because it is a false choice the government should be asking how to shift to a sustainable energy infrastructure and away from fossil fuels and nuclear power
599439 the democratic process will go out the window if the nuclear side is delayed from the governments point of view they have got to address the energy problem so they will look to coal and get that up and running
599440 if direct action changes the governments energy policy and could stop a potential 10 more coal powered stations then i would stand behind it
599441 it is a peaceful protest they are there to take a message to people about climate change which is one of the most greatly ignored issues of our time it is the biggest problem we have ever faced
599442 if this is the way that climate camp want their activists to behave then they are showing a blatant disregard for their own safety and that of others
599443 those ads really were focused on two things they were focused on the fact that sen obama wants to raise taxes and im opposed of it and he opposes an energy policy which would work including offshore drilling so the message there is therere stark differences between myself and sen obama
599444 i think we should be in a post racial environment
599445 i think sen barack obama has done an admirable job of that i dont think he has race baited i think he has been very good about that

599487 is they took the concept of sanctuary and they applied it in a way that it is as close to harboring as ive ever seen
599488 then they accommodate them by providing all these services to continue their unlawful status

599490 we needed to work to correct those problems involving juvenile delinquency

599537 peaceful demonstrations in the streets by chinese animal welfare groups are showing the strength of feeling against the abject misery and torture suffered by millions of dogs and cats within the food industry today
599538 the scale of the cruelty in chinas live animal markets is immense and it is estimated that 10 million dogs or more are brutally slaughtered in the industry each year
599539 animals asia field investigators have witnessed trucks loaded with anything up to 2 000 dogs per truck arriving at wholesale markets having spent several days and nights squashed together in tiny cages unable to move without food water or shelter
599540 the dogs are then brutally lifted by the neck and hurled into a pen by the traders wielding metal tongs here they fight through fear hunger and desperation to survive before suffering a lingering violent death as they are either bludgeoned over the head stabbed in the neck or groin hung electrocuted or thrown conscious into drums of boiling water
599541 more and more chinese people are standing up against dog and cat eating in china in november 2007 we sponsored our second companion animal symposium in guangzhou which saw the leaders of 39 chinese animal welfare groups representing over 250 000 supporters calling upon the government to end the slaughter of dogs and cats for their meat and fur

599544 now employed as sniffer dogs at airports and railway stations in china dogs are also proving invaluable and cheap assistants for law enforcement officers
599545 we know that many foreigners are offended when they see dog and cat meat on the menu but more importantly many chinese people are equally appalled
599546 i hope the government reflects on the wishes of its people closes this ghastly industry once and for all and allows dogs and cats to be recognised and cherished as our friends not food
599547 we are an organization of values and we expect all of our members to live by them we are charged with keeping our citizens safe from harm and we take that responsibility very seriously
599548 it is time that we prepare oxbow to be reopened
599549 if people think were only keeping people who peed on a sidewalk we aint
599550 i dont think we know if this is a two week problem or a two year problem
599551 is it a summer spike or is this more to the extent that we need secured beds to keep scary people off the streets oxbow is probably the next choice
599552 these early releases should concern us all a great deal
599553 the message you send to people when you book and release them is that the criminal justice system is completely ineffective and that they can act without any risk of consequence
599554 look at our crime stats look at what is happening in our community right now there is no question that jail overcrowding has a direct effect
599555 im not a big fan of opening prisons for the sake of opening prisons
599556 but if the current facility is inadequate for meeting the demand then we should increase the supply
599557 the more people are not caught or not punished when they are caught undermines the value of deterrence
599558 this isnt some great mystery that is being unveiled right now
599559 within the community of offenders it is common knowledge that you are going to be booked and released
599560 native herbs of common use but difficult to get and rukake lawen
599561 who eat calafate s fruit do not leave patagonia never more if you are foreinger and you are alone you will marry and live at patagonia for your whole life the first people who arrived to patagonia married with countrymen had children and died in patagonia if you leave patogonia then you return perhaps the fruit is blue violet like countrygirls dark colour as the power for the man who eats it all of us belive that calafate has this power
599562 before the huinca comes to those places there was a very cold winter there was not more food the people died the pud the choique the luan had disappeared nobody knew where they had gone the con young people went to look for animals to hunt but most of them never came back so the lonkos mapuche chiefs decided to have a meeting and call for help to others communities but it was not enough one day the con came back and carried nguilli he said that when he was at the cordillera andean mountain range he met with an old man the con told him what has been happening with his people the old man asked him why they ate with araucaria s seeds that it the true food that nguenech n has sent for us after that the con did not see anymore the old man everybody met to listen the story someone said that it was nguenech n mapuche god messenger they looked for every seeds recollected and ate them since then when the nguillat n is celebrated the rehue is set on the pehu n and everybody drink chafi
599563 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
599564 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
599565 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
599566 perhaps it is that flexible concept that defines relationships and how they develop maybe you need to not be with someone in order to love them properly maybe it is just a shitty old world and you gotta accept love anyway it comes to you with me i usually only ever get love in small portions or in abnormal or conditional ways that never stay too long do i like it like that who knows that is like wondering if you had a different mom would you be better off no instead you cherish what you have i love my mom because she is the only mom i will ever have and i love my fucked up incomplete loves because they are all i have ever known if you cant smile at shit youll probably cry love will rear its head and if youre lucky you will find someone who can stand your shit for the long run in that sense all love even the difficult ones are successful as long as you leave it having gained something even if only the learning experience of having your heart broken again
599567 i think theres a place for romance in the world even if romance can be delusional and damaging in a relationship itself
599568 im fine is what you say when you cant break
599569 by gary numan that let me know it was cool to be a geek the track
599570 is a very mellow laid back track that makes me miss the 80s when it comes to their music and the 90s when i finally began realizing that i wasnt going back to my old neighborhood windham hill piano sampler is beautiful and yet makes you reflect at the same time sometimes hearing compositions like this can make me break down and cry because for me it forces me to think about everything i have went through growing up the loneliness the crushes i had on young ladies that in the end never gave me a second look but for some reason made me keep moving forward because deep down i knew god had a plan for me walk and talk like angels
599571 take my hand we shall cross this boundary and we shall do it together
599572 i am rooted to the earth but entirely of my own accord siren how am i to fly
599573 a breath on the wind is always there but once you release it it will be gone from you forever know that it still exists it will not falter it will not fade much like the hope that always exists it may feel inaccessible but that does not mean it does not exist
599574 to some life is not worth living alive to others solitude is the only friend they need seclusion is the only company they desire
599575 remember this hand i have given you there will be a time where it is all you will want when everything feels like its crashing down
599576 even god has not only a single face and yet no matter what you accomplish in this life what deeds you bring to be you shall never stand above his name to all he is an invisible man with visible tendencies to all he dances in the masquerade of misery and misfortune messiahs and miracles he is what shall come to pass regardless of outcome
599577 they should ask their state governments to increase manpower in police forces they should ask for their police forces to be trained and modernised
599578 centre will look into state governments request for anti terror laws
599579 if some are raising this issue i would like to ask that whether these laws being used are the provisions of pota which have been put into unlawful activities prevention act being used why are they not being used
599580 if the offence is committed by a person living in a state there is no difficulty in proceeding against him but there are a group of persons living in different states and they are intending to perpetrate an offence states machinery will not be helpful
599581 the country needs a machinery which has access to more states and today we have come to conclusion that it is not only inter state matter but it is becoming international matter and now there are ramifications going outside boundaries of the country and state government and police do not have that kind of capacity
599582 if you have a federal investigating agency in such matters it would be helpful and then if you have an agency which can prevent these things that agency will be able to better prevent it
599583 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone nor am i complaining against anyone
599584 i am allowing the state government of gujarat to investigate the matter properly and bring these facts to our notice we will examine them and necessary steps would be taken without fair and unfair
599585 union government will be very correct and hard on terrorists and will be very careful in not convicting and causing difficulties to innocents
599586 we should not add fuel to the fire by saying that terrorism in india is such that it cannot be controlled
599587 i say that this is a problem i say this problem should not be dealt with in a light manner
599588 unfortunately stock assessments in general are an evolving science and the morro bay area is especially data poor so neither party has hard evidence backing them up
599589 mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
599590 i was still negotiating with them and then i heard i was traded
599591 we offered a very aggressive multiyear contract that would have made him one of the highest paid players in the game and it was not accepted
599592 over here after the game you can go to dinner and nobody bothers you
599593 the media here is much nicer than whats in boston
599594 why am i going to waste my energy on what people say about me
599595 i just want to come here and play hard every game
599596 thats the knock on you and you didnt look like you were playing hard on that ball hit to the wall friday night
599597 more like i just couldnt believe it i thought i was dreaming
599598 manny ramirez hes the best hitter in baseball its that simple trust me one man can make a difference
599599 give me the money you owe us and then you can live your life as you please without us

599605 john is very comfortable with dwon and baylor already was on walls list
599606 theres a whole list of jobs and responsibilities hell have from mentoring kids to helping them become socially ready to relate to society
599607 with coach cliftons experience playing basketball professionally that helps him relate to kids that age which is a great asset
599608 brown has been an important target for state and sidney went out and got him
599609 dont be surprised if howell has a bigger impact on the wolfpack program than j j hickson did
599610 he got 39 points in a game in the aau nationals in orlando last week
599611 right now sean is shooting the ball better than former duke star j j reddick did in high school
599612 sean is 6 5 and stands out there and drills it he is quite a marksman
599613 sidney lowe has put together a tremendous group of players
599614 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
599615 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
599616 my little boy is due to start in the reception class in september and he will miss out on learning this way if there is a delay
599617 it is a fantastic curriculum and is fantastic for kids because they are learning through doing
599618 many european countries follow this model and their exam results and universities are miles ahead of ours
599619 these technologies will not only help reduce fuel bills and carbon emissions but will engage people and communities in thinking about how their energy is produced and used which is vital if we are to meet our long term targets for tackling climate change
599620 it will help us better to understand the role microgeneration technologies for space heating can play in helping the fuel poor building on the wider support that is already available
599621 perhaps the most startling fact of all to emerge from our researches is that each day only 100 000 readers in scotland read newspapers with almost no scottish content whereas in wales 1 760 000 are reading papers with virtually no welsh content
599622 it seems to us impossible to argue that those figures do not have serious consequences for informed democracy in wales
599623 you occasionally glimpse st mary street or the bay there on torchwood but what you dont have is a portrayal of life in wales
599624 in that sense you know wales really is a forgotten nation when it comes to the bbc you dont see the portrayal of ordinary every day life in this country
599625 the bbc has recognised the importance of ensuring that all parts of the uk are appropriately reflected on its services that is not to say that weve got it right
599626 i think the whole of the bbc would certainly agree that there is a long way to go on the whole notion of portrayal
599627 i think there is an absolute requirement on a publicly funded broadcaster to reflect the cultures voices identity and economy of the whole of the united kingdom from which it collects its licence fee that is an imperative
599628 following a request from the welsh assembly government we are in discussion with eu officials regarding the limited use of welsh at eu level with a view to establishing a workable and efficient system
599629 this is not about adding welsh to the list of official eu languages
599630 these proposals are still under discussion and no arrangements have yet been agreed
599631 any costs incurred if such a system is established will be paid for by the welsh assembly government as part of its commitment to promote the welsh language
599632 he was always such a very proud man and for him to go the way that he did breaks all our hearts really its just totally totally undignified
599633 we suspected c diff for about a week before hearing snippets of conversation
599634 no explanation as to what it was what to look out for
599635 but obviously that didnt happen and i believe thats why my fathers dead now because he caught two infections both due to lack of hygiene in the hospital
599636 what i am calling for is the auditor general for wales jeremy colman to conduct an inquiry he is somebody who inspires a great deal of public confidence
599637 this is a victory for common sense and freedom of speech
599638 the guidance will now have to be withdrawn and as a consequence all assembly members are able once again to communicate openly and honestly with their constituents without fear of repercussion
599639 the purported distinction between assembly business on the one hand and political activities on the other seems to lack any logical basis and to be unworkable
599640 the rules set out in the guidance would not satisfy the requirements of article 10 because they lack clarity and certainty
599641 the assembly commission was in danger of censoring what we were seen to do
599642 it is part of a recognition now in society that we have got to reduce injuries and deaths on our roads
599643 they are still far far too high and we have these targets to meet and i was talking to the police at the weekend about how we can work with them to make our roads safer
599644 there are a number of things we can do thats looking at speed limits looking at traffic calming measures also giving advice and education to young drivers in particular
599645 so its a range of things and i think we all now must have a role to play in reducing injuries and deaths on our roads
599646 speaking on behalf of schools in blackwood we have had near misses on no end of occasions where traffic is going in excess of the current speed limit of 30mph and normally theyre going in excess of 40mph and upwards so something has to be done
599647 at the end of the day you cannot put a price on a childs life and these changes must be done
599648 before we started to put in 20mph speed limits 81 of vehicles were doing more than 25mph
599649 since then 58 of vehicles now do less than 20mph so they work they work very well and theyre very popular
599650 from 2000 to 2003 before we started we had 73 fatalities in 2004 to 2006 it was down to 56
599651 cities like portsmouth have started to introduce a city wide 20mph speed limit
599652 now we really would oppose things like that simply because if you have a general speed limit of 20mph motorists dont see the point of it
599653 i think its disgusting for them to just cut it without giving us any notice or saying or explaining is terrible
599654 that was the first id heard of it and i cant believe we werent told anything until so late in the day
599655 i know not a great deal of people use the bus but if it was costing them too much why dont they lay on a smaller bus or just run it at certain times of the day
599656 on the one hand the government is trying to get us to not use our cars and then something like this happens which doesnt really give us much of alternative
599657 ive always maintained that the newport rogerstone rail link should have been there from the start and this latest development only strengthens my view
599658 i will continue to press for the scheduled opening to be speeded up
599659 i think that people travelling between newport and the valleys currently prefer to travel by car because of the inconvenience of the bus link and thats why it hasnt been popular
599660 we are very disappointed that passenger numbers have been very low since the start of the service
599661 following a review it has been decided that there is little demand for the service from regular train passengers and that it does not represent value for money
599662 its very important there is a softer legacy as well
599663 its about coaching its about parental involvement its about using sport as a bridgehead into educational and cultural values
599664 in sydney barcelona in athens no olympic city or nation has seen any upward swing in participation levels in olympic or non olympic sports following hosting of the games
599665 wyeside is 30 this december and were not sure if we can make it stay open until our 30th birthday
599666 i think a lot of arts organisations like us are going to be facing a much tougher future because theres going to be less and less money
599667 not a single sporting event has ever been shown to have a long term economic benefit for the country or region in question that hosted that event
599668 i think lots of quite clever people in sports consultancies marketing companies and sports organising bodies have become very adept very clever at getting lots of money out of the public sector on the basis that there will be long term benefits that will never be actually measured
599669 the situation that arose on tuesday raises questions about the democratic rights of people in wales and their legitimate expectation to be able to present petitions at the national assembly
599670 if the electorate feels so strongly about an issue that they want to present a written document to ams then it is important we give them the chance to do that
599671 at no time did south wales police aim to prevent the protestors from submitting their petition to the senedd
599672 however whilst we were prepared to facilitate the protest we have a responsibility to ensure that disruption to the general public and other road users is kept to an absolute minimum
599673 for that reason it was agreed three days before the protest that five lorries would be permitted to travel to the senedd to make the presentation
599674 it will improve capacity in our capitals major train stations and have benefits for the valleys by increasing the number of seats on trains and improving services
599675 passengers are the real winners if the proposal goes ahead
599676 already 67 of train journeys in wales are within south wales and this number is set to grow this proposal could address the future demand by easing capacity issues and improving train services
599677 the impression it gives to both visitors and those who use it everyday is important it must represent a modern vibrant city
599678 add to the regeneration and revival of the city as it gets ready to host one of the worlds premier sporting events the ryder cup
599679 no additional funding will be made available to public agencies for them to carry out these duties
599680 i agree it will be more difficult to achieve this in an adverse economic situation but the lesson is not to abandon the field of play but to redouble our efforts
599681 it is a national scandal that so many people in wales die from an illness which can be treated if detected early enough
599682 i fail to see why wales cannot implement a national screening programme with the same speed as scotland
599683 the assembly governments failure to match this ambitious target could see people in wales dying needlessly
599684 the argument is that they do not have the capacity to do the work are they frightened by what they might find in the screening programme
599685 the position of the tumour meant it could be discovered without screening but for most people that is not the case
599686 im disappointed by the delays because we know that lives would be saved we know that two in every 1 000 people who are screened have bowel cancer
599687 there are hundreds of people walking round wales with bowel cancer tumours and they dont know theyve got them
599688 it is vital that the introduction of a screening programme does not disadvantage those that have symptoms suggestive of bowel disease
599689 after detailed planning for the programme it became clear that more time would be needed for the roll out
599690 this report confirms what welsh licence fee payers have been thinking for some time that the bbc network news has failed to consistently reflect the changed political nature of the uk in its day to day news broadcasts
599691 it has not been distinguishing between the different policies of the devolved nations in its news reporting and this may have undermined the welsh publics confidence in the bbcs ability to report news items accurately and clearly and in a way which is relevant to their every day lives
599692 this is in turn may also have had an impact on the ability of some welsh citizens to receive information and make decisions in relation to their national democratic institution
599693 the conclusions of this report on the bbcs performance in london are in stark contrast to the coverage of welsh politics provided by bbc wales which has played a vital role in reporting events at our new devolved institution since 1999
599694 the message was emerging very clearly that there were shortcomings in the licence fee payers view of what the bbc was doing and indeed the audience council said in its report last year to the trust that bbc network services still failed to reflect the complexity of devolution
599695 a clear finding is that people in the uk wherever they live are very interested in news in the other parts of the uk
599696 so if we look back at last year for example the research mentions the 2007 coverage of the election and there was very very scant coverage on the network of anything that was going on in wales
599697 every reason to believe they will be constructive and purposeful
599698 at giving a fair representation of life outside the m25
599699 we recognise that there are particular problems in delivering affordable housing in rural areas and i therefore welcomed the foundations establishment of a commission to examine those issues in wales
599700 i am the first to agree that the supply of affordable housing in rural wales needs to be increased
599701 we are committed to achieving this by all means available and are currently consulting on guidance for the preparation of affordable housing delivery plans
599702 this review will also be looking at one of the key recommendations of the rowntree report which is changing the regulations of housing associations
599703 worrying reading and highlights the clear failures in assembly government policy
599704 we have almost 90 000 households on local authority waiting lists in wales and yet the government only funded 346 new affordable homes in the last financial year barely enough to scratch the surface of this problem
599705 i can assure you that i take this issue very seriously and that the welsh assembly government is committed to tackling c difficile as a core element of our wider strategy against all healthcare associated infections
599706 we have always collected laboratory data on the under 65 year old group but this is quite different to our over 65 year old mandatory surveillance system
599707 we will be extending this surveillance system and its reporting to the over two year olds in future
599708 i now need to be confident that the trust has put in place measures to reduce the risk of infection even further and that when infections occur that measures are put in place to reduce the spread
599709 to this end i have asked health inspectorate wales hiw to carry out an immediate independent review of the concerns raised about the number of cases of c difficile at prince charles hospital
599710 there are an enormous number of apartments in the bay at the moment which are unlet and unoccupied
599711 we know weve been building something like 1 250 apartments a year i would suggest that probably one third to one half of those are unoccupied
599712 ive got real concerns about no community being built up over the years and i think that can bring with it that sort of ghost town sort of feel
599713 im concerned that when youve got empty properties the landlords may well just rent them out to a wide range of people who may not be suited to that type of living
599714 i think we could be storing up some social problems for the future
599715 the argument we are not creating sustainable communities is not borne out
599716 we are taking great strides weve got tough new guidance and we are looking more and more at developers contributing towards community facilities and not just building apartment blocks in isolation so we are creating truly sustainable communities
599717 if you can put a concentration of what you are building in the future on brown field land you can build more sustainable communities where you can have flats and apartments close to the facilities
599718 the biggest flashpoint in the world at the moment is the israeli palestinian conflict so we must understand both sides of the facts
599719 i know quite a lot from the palestinian side but i havent been able to speak with any israeli till today so in my fortunate position i thought this was the best opportunity for me to invite him
599720 that was the whole idea to bring him over and listen to his views
599721 i dont want to put my head in the sand and i appreciate everybodys feelings and being muslim probably everyone knows my feelings but i am a human being and a peaceful human being
599722 im sure everyones got their own mind to make and im sure some of them most of them will love to listen to ron prosor and i will pledge again when i see lord elis thomas in the next couple of days to change his mind
599723 i am unwilling to accept the invitation to meet the ambassador because of my objection to the failure of the state of israel to meet its international obligations to the palestinian people of the holy lands i would invite other colleagues to do the same
599724 if ams have concerns as i do myself about policies followed by the israeli government then surely its better to use this event to talk about those concerns rather than to put up barriers which can only promote further misunderstanding
599725 this will be the new ambassadors first visit to wales at the request of the israeli embassy he will be meeting the first minister to familiarise himself with our country and what wales has to offer the world
599726 insulting to the people of israel and demeaning to the national assembly
599727 if the labour movement splinters between its trade union arm and its political arm by having a huge row over public sector pay then you can see that there would be dangers david cameron would pull off exactly the same trick as margaret thatcher did and we would have made it easier for him to walk in
599728 we still have to face up to the organising and recruitment challenge as the economy has changed and workplaces have changed
599729 as president i want to see us build on the work of previoius years and take stock of the challenges facing us in wales
599730 people have written off the labour party time and time again over the last 18 years
599731 that is not to say we havent got a difficult situation we have people have given us a good kicking
599732 i made a mistake i didnt whine i was responsible for what happened
599733 people are so ignorant about the illness and so i wanted to inform and help others who are bulimic to speak out too
599734 i have always been in favour of regional and devolved assemblies
599735 i am concerned about pr it will reduce the level of support for labour in this heartland wales
599736 maintained the balance between old principles and the new labour direction
599737 i never used the phrase new labour but i recognized that it was necessary under tony blair
599738 i am not one of those people who believes that lay people cannot be trusted to be involved in these sorts of decisions
599739 the cost is currently incurred by hwc which has confirmed that this is a major cause of its overspend
599740 these delays raise questions about whether there has been appropriate recognition of the rights of the patient including possible breaches of the human rights act
599741 this situation is unacceptable and is in need of urgent resolution by the welsh assembly government
599742 the cost of diesel is going up almost every day were just handing all our money over
599743 people will have to stop working sooner or later because theres no point working for a loss
599744 i wanted to come today because im only 24 and its affecting me more than the older guys
599745 ive got other bills to pay and ive to pay for my car something has to be done or i will lose my job
599746 to respond to short term pressures the 2008 budget announced that the 2p per litre fuel duty increase scheduled for 1 april will be deferred until 1 october
599747 the price of fuel and the duties imposed on it by the uk government are not the responsibility of the assembly government
599748 rising oil prices and the impending threat from global climate change mean the government must take urgent action to ensure our addiction to oil doesnt set us on the road to ruin
599749 we didnt have enough crews we had some problems with our trains infrastructure long overdue for renewal
599750 there were some certain basics where the eye had gone off the ball
599751 if this improvement weve seen is better throughout the year we can look back and say were actually proud of this railway that were running
599752 david ward and i wont be here in six months if that improvement isnt better our bosses will find someone else to do the job and im confident that wont be the case
599753 ive been following the privatisation story for the last 15 years and in my view its been a complete disaster and an enormous waste of taxpayers money
599754 ideologically and practically speaking a private railway has provided a level of investment innovation and imagination that wouldnt have happened if british rail had stayed as it was
599755 the kind of car that all countries and car companies love now is the green car consumers will also be happy when they drive such a car knowing it saves fuel and does not pollute
599756 such an effort by proton will also assist the government in saving petrol and preserving the environment
599757 im aware that he saw the footage on tv last night and chose to attend mt druitt police station detective superintendent john kerlatec told reporters in sydney today
599758 these interventions have a vital role in preventing repossession and homelessness for the households involved as well as allowing them to remain in the area and any children in the household to remain in local schools
599759 these schemes also provide a preferable alternative to some private companies that offer sale and leaseback schemes which often require homeowners to sell the property at considerably less than the market price and rent it back with short term security
599760 were extremely thrilled but at the same time were very cautious of the massive challenge that lies ahead of us and that this will be a huge responsibility for us

599762 this development strengthens the industry as well as taking welsh to multiple platforms and creating pluralism in the welsh language news sector
599763 getting the word out giving voice to the voiceless through catholic media
599764 if you want to be rich and happy dont go to school
599765 not getting sufficient coverage on the network at the moment its about 0 8 which is worth about 23m to wales
599766 unacceptable that some people in wales will get a poorer service than others we have to try to deal with those issues
599767 i think venom could headline a good movie on his own but it would be tricky and would depend in large part on the script
599768 spider man 3 the story and the success of the movie would depend almost entirely on the personality of the character who would combine with the symbiote his motivations his background his methodology his heart and soul

599772 we want his contract to reward the impact he has had on our athletic revenue streams but he is almost as important to the whole greenville community said holland citing the coachs fundraising efforts especially the drew steele skip holtz project that has generated more than 500 000 for special olympics training facilities
599773 skip has shown more interest in the contracts of his assistant coaches than he has his own and that is why he has been able to assemble a first rate staff
599774 i love it here my wife loves it my kids love it
599775 my job is to continue to build a winner and contend year in and year out for a conference championship
599776 but overall im extremely encouraged said holtz whose passion permeated throughout the murphy center banquet room and also appeared to rev up his players
599777 the majority of thais are pleased with the reshuffle because they are confident that the government is able to solve many problems facing the country especially slow economic growth
599778 it is very disappointing to see the new cabinet list
599779 the new cabinet cannot give thais any hope in dealing with the economic situation
599780 just want to topple the government for them its wrong for us to even get up in the morning and take a breath
599781 he threw a split when i thought a fastball was coming just bad timing he shouldnt have to worry about not being able to see the signs thats unacceptable on my end to have that happen
599782 its one of those things where thats the way its gone for us
599783 kouz hits it in the right spot at the right speed and he gets thrown out by one step in other years he mightve hit it just off or he beats it out we tend to hit the balls at the wrong place at the wrong time and that goes for all of us the entire year
599784 when i hit it i told myself it was out of here
599785 but then two steps into it i was like it might not get out just the whole petco fear of the ball not getting out

599792 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
599793 i was in the part of the building which didnt collapse with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors
599794 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
599795 we think the collapse was caused by a gas canister explosion in the building given the burns on the injured
599796 it shows there is tremendous pride about the cfl a tremendous attachment to the culture institution that the cfl represents
599797 even quebeckers have a strong sense of association with the cfl in fact its one of the very few institutions on which english canadians and quebeckers have a common view
599798 so the old adage about the grey cup being the most unifying symbol in the country thats still true
599799 its clear that the nfl has made big inroads in canada in the last 20 years especially within ontario and quebec
599800 with its marketing dollars and promotion it has clearly penetrated this market as opposed to the west where the cfl is dominant in toronto the cfl is facing very formidable competition from the nfl and in ontario and even quebec they want to see an nfl franchise in toronto but regardless they want the cfl to exist

599817 9 insane cases that prove the us legal system is screwed
599818 awesome see ur bound to find someone and u doubted me
599819 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
599820 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
599821 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
599822 an alternative choice for the care of the unfunded latin american nationals
599823 weve done flights to lithuania poland honduras guatemala and mexico
599824 but out of about a dozen cases a year we probably fly only a couple back
599825 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
599826 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
599827 he didnt talk he didnt understand anything he stayed curled up in a ball but he was alive
599828 i said sure what can come of such a case
599829 then it took on a life of its own they probably regret they ever called me
599830 the question to be answered is if the patients condition is terminal
599831 we arrived for a visit and he said to me you are montejo
599832 the real problem is if we find an underlying problem and now we have six of them six patients who showed up in and that we are now seeing three times a week for
599833 a community hospital is going to give care but is it the right thing we have a lot of american citizens who need our help we only make about 3 percent over our bottom line if were lucky we need to make capital improvements and do things for our community
599834 or the government should step in and otherwise exercise its authority for deportation or whatever it wants to do
599835 and if the rehab worked then luis might have become a functional person and nobodys charge
599836 once you take that step for how long are you going to do that a year 10 years 50 years
599837 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges
599838 if a hospital in florida asks if we can take care of a guatemalan patient the tendency is to say yes
599839 this case is not simply a case as some would try and paint it of money this is a case about care for a man in this country illegally who has reached maximum medical improvement at our hospital and is ready to be discharged and whose home government
599840 your honor this is a case about a hospital that has failed to do its job properly
599841 why are you sad when you have basically everything that could be offered to you
599842 as aquinas once stated the good is not the enemy of the perfect
599843 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
599844 that facility could have taken care of me any day
599845 telling everyone that he was from miami florida and showing them his toy cat
599846 that he would be staying with his new friends in guatemala and that i was leaving
599847 its the same as the classic fall on the stairs right
599848 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
599849 how could i possibly have given him what he needs
599850 he was lying in the hallway on a stretcher covered in his own excrement
599851 so we cleaned him up and we brought him home
599852 its a letter that says listen dont take action to dump this individual because youll be risking legal action
599853 should they win we would like them to take those damages and pay his hospital bill
599854 they chose the wrong way to deal with it the right way would have been through the legislature there is no program in place to appropriately distribute care to undocumented persons who are catastrophically injured and there should be but you dont stick a brain injured immigrant on a private plane and spirit him out of the country in the predawn hours
599855 the first striking thing was his disposition he was very very happy
599856 then the second thing he was well cared for what i did was i got down over him and hugged him but also smelled and there were no bedsores nothing was malodorous
599857 i said his quality of life is better than it would be in an american nursing home
599858 but i hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed
599859 there was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to florida
599860 we needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in guatemala
599861 for many years i am caring for him like he is a baby changing his diaper washing him but this is worse i am worried to leave him alone at all
599862 the day my mother is no longer whats going to happen to me
599863 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
599864 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
599865 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
599866 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
599867 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
599868 it would be possible to set up a good health care arrangement for him because in private practice we have all types of specialties that he needs
599869 i am sending you some little things luis i hope that you like them
599870 that we miss you and love you a lot may god continue to bless you

599894 one has to play according ot needs of the team not according ot his whims and fancies i would prefer a player who atleast is consistent even though he doesnt score triple hundren rather than this guy who blasts his way to triple hundred and then for the next few innings is useless identify one player in any international team who has such an attitude
599895 in communities around australia from the suburbs to regional areas and to the inner cities many of us are often struck by the extraordinary efforts certain individuals and organisations everyday people among us make to better and assist australian society
599896 the human rights medals and awards were set up 21 years ago so that these people could be recognised for their selfless and often uncelebrated efforts and commitment in their day to day lives to issues of human rights social justice and equality efforts that serve to better the society we live in
599897 if you are one of these people or know of one of these people or organisations i urge you to submit a nomination for one of these awards such as the community individual award community organisation award human rights medal or young peoples human rights medal
599898 south nevada has an image problem and it has a real problem
599899 its a huge multiprong attack trying to turn the area around from blighted and crime ridden and downtrodden
599900 were not turning it into rodeo drive we dont want all new businesses we want to support the ones that are already there
599901 you have great access off the interstate you sit between the broadmoor and downtown this is truly creekside unlike anywhere but maybe manitou springs theres nothing else that offers creekside which in our vision is really important
599902 long term we just think thats a really strong area for us to be owning ground and i would envision some new buildings that would have a lot of character and a lot of charm
599903 you have all kinds of demands on city services in declining areas
599904 crime rates are usually higher calls for service are higher in these areas blight breeds blight its in the citys overall best interest to make sure these areas have the opportunity to rejuvenate themselves instead of continuing in a state of decline
599905 the customer or the potential customer still thinks of south nevada as a place to find a prostitute especially young guys who are looking for that i dont know how much longer the reputation will saddle the area
599906 if developers are a good way of getting things cleaned up and making a nicer part of the neighborhood then thats wonderful but if we have to take the cheyenne motel to court and shut them down under the public nuisance ordinance then so be it i dont care how this place gets cleaned up it needs to get cleaned up
599907 the event in tibet this spring as well as protests regarding the torch relay was a worldwide negative campaign for the olympics in beijing
599908 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organisation with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
599909 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organisation including having ties with israel
599910 we have to decide on one central and basic position and that is that we cooperate and want to help the pragmatic forces among the palestinians those who want to negotiate with us and who are fighting the radical islam of hamas those who oppose terrorism
599911 we are sending a message that no one is above the law and that no family is above the law gaza will enjoy peace and security
599912 it was an ugly scene with blood everywhere i could not count the dead i just glanced at once and i ran away for my life
599913 especially with the way bush finished up spring bush in the spring game was very good probably one of the best ive ever seen from him he played in that game the way we want him to play
599914 and if its not then obviously we have a pretty good idea of where we need to go
599915 you look at the history weve had with our quarterback and the guys who have been successful for us have been tough guys
599916 theyve been mentally tough theyve prepared themselves and theyve been able to take the criticism and everything that goes along with the position
599917 keeping the value down for when they can sell it to one of their mates
599918 unless workers aged 55 to 59 increase their saving substantially or work beyond age 65 they will be unable to maintain their current standard of living and will have to reduce their standard of living significantly more than todays retirees to minimize the risk of exhausting their financial assets

599921 sister mary thomas zinkand then mercy president and ceo was my mentor during my discernment period and a true friend until the day she died
599922 i hope and pray that the sisters of mercy and mercy medical center will be able to continue our commitment to the needy of baltimore not only now but
599923 being of irish descent it would be nice to have another trip to ireland and spend some time in dublin at the sisters of mercy international center and enjoy the lovely people there and the beautiful scenery
599924 i think i will need a pair of roller skates to help me walk the halls at mercy after the new 18 story state of the art mary catherine bunting center opens in 2010
599925 it would always be great to get more exercise just walking around the city and seeing how downtown baltimore continues to expand it would be good for my health
599926 id like to think that i run the gamut though its probably more preppy than id like to admit
599927 like the majority of women fashion is important its part of the fun of being a girl but it doesnt consume my life
599928 i do however enjoy shopping for clothing and accessories on trips and vacations when i wear a certain article of clothing ill remember the trip that i went on or where i first wore the dress or outfit whether i bought it during a weekend in vegas or purchased it for a friends wedding
599929 my shopping habits are seasonal i like to do one or two big trips a year and be done with it with sporadic replenishment update trips in between i shop more during colder winter months because i prefer to spend spring summer fall outdoors basically i dont want to be stuck in a mall or department store
599930 i always always always look for outfits i realized a few years back that i had several great skirts and pairs of pants along with many tops but none of them mixed well together it was a huge waste of time and money to only buy half of an outfit for me now i only buy things in complete sets its also advice that after years of hearing i finally took from mom
599931 i have friends on both sides and i personally have not been able to choose its a lot of pressure
599932 there hasnt been this much advance demand for a book since the seventh harry potter book was released last summer
599933 ever since the first book came out its been steadily building in popularity im 50 and i read it and ive talked many women my age into reading it its very romantic though theres no sex in it at all i think this notion of a byronic hero who has to restrain himself to protect the woman he loves resonated with a lot of female fantasies
599934 stephenie meyers writing might not be spectacular but shes an amazing storyteller
599935 what i like about the world that she has created in twilight is that there are rules about what vampires can do and what they cant do and the rules dont change in the harry potter books sometimes she rowling will put the characters in a predicament and then invent some new magic that they can do to get them out of it
599936 stephenie meyer knows how to spin out the moral perplexity of growing into adulthood and making decisions youll have to face the rest of your life
599937 and she knows how to write a lot of adventure i was flipping pages wanting to find whatever happens next
599938 he saw what he did as a spontaneous gift to the city something that just happened like a dream i would never reconstruct any of that or let trickery intrude on that part of the film
599939 and that anything that happened in that part of the country could happen anywhere in the country
599940 to make it that much more of a social pressure cooker
599941 finding people who felt they needed to accomplish something if they feel that need in all likelihood their year will follow a dramatic arc
599942 all these people have sides that dont fit into the stereotype
599943 he knew i wanted to get his ideas and use his energy and engagement to bring his story to life many people in new york first encounter the tale of this frenchman walking between the towers as one in the family of new york stunts but its really about an artistic performance made possible by a conspiracy i always saw this as a suspense film a thriller
599944 he transformed an environment and in 1974 that environment hadnt quite been finished
599945 their interviews were very emotional detailed and fresh this was a big event in their lives probably the most exciting moment they ever had
599946 every film is defined by a series of choices my goal was always to tell this story as fully as i can and give people some of the joy and thrills i had finding out about it a more conventional documentary might have commentary linking what philippe does to childhood traumas which is equally interpretive and possibly more phony than putting on a really good show
599947 im just here to support carmelo anthony with his foundation to help these kids in baltimore and urban areas as much as we can however we can
599948 me and melo came out in the nba draft in the same year 2003
599949 without the community of baltimore i dont think carmelo would be who he is
599950 its exciting about the whole thing because when you look around and see what hes come back to do its hard to speak about its so overjoyful and thats where im at right about now
599951 oh its just great man its just always good to give back to the kids
599952 its a little bit like a draw in football i guess but the rules are that the first across the line in the last race gets the trophy
599953 rick kelly and i were tied first and second in new zealand last year and i was given second there thats the way it is and ill certainly take it this time
599954 we won that last race on genuine speed and its a shame mark winterbottom wasnt there for us to gauge our speed from but youve got to stay on the track for that to happen
599955 it was tough conditions out there and when i turned in i just locked the tyre
599956 i would like to ride as usual but i suffer the movements of the bike and i cannot react its hard to think to get a good result under these conditions after 4 5 laps im strengthless i hope that some night rest can buck me up
599957 we have not reached the top yet therefore tomorrow morning during the warm up we are going to work further on fine tuning the bike
599958 this is not an easy track and it is difficult in some places to judge the correct speed
599959 the team kept saying on the radio that i was close to winning the race
599960 we just kept pushing and trying to make up as much time as we could i was racing the clock for the entire 40 laps and sometimes a race like that is more rewarding than a victory
599961 the last one was a little unexpected but this time i can come out of my skin and enjoy it a little more the best part is that weve come here with no expectations and nailed it
599962 i know this circuit and this country well so i am feeling good at the moment ever since monza we have not been having great results but now it is much better the bike is easier to ride than before so i am feeling a lot better
599963 a preserve in which fruits are kept whole in a thick and very sweet syrup
599964 yes i know but this way you can just give me a dollar bill back
599965 were sorry but they could not do that kind of thing
599966 too many deer are being hit by cars out here i dont think this is a good place for them to be crossing anymore
599967 has anyone put anything in your baggage without your knowledge
599968 if it was without my knowledge how would i know
599969 28 for the camera on our fingers this is why were english phds
599970 this cant be right i have a lot of friends im relatively attractive i dont smell and dammit people like me
599971 theyre really loud and they look like a cell phone
599972 if one of the olympians is from one of my sons provinces shanxi and henan ill definitely root for that athlete
599973 for it to be in his homeland is a great opportunity to teach him more about china its really exciting
599974 we would see advertisements and signs of the coming olympics
599975 i thought the kids would make some olympic medals with ribbon and paper
599976 we are so excited i think the adults are more excited than the kids
599977 were trying to explain to amalia what the olympics are and that its special because its in china
599978 and she wants to know why we cant go to china to see the olympics
599979 anything related to china shes really interested in it now
599980 we saw lots of what looked like clams it was maine this would be a possibility
599981 we boiled up water in a very large pot and threw our clams in who knew they would turn out to be squished balls of horse manure covered with sand imagine the stench i think that island remains uninhabited to this day
599982 it was the camp policy to have canteen every afternoon where each camper got to choose a candy bar that day as every day i chose my favorite the incomparable oh henry a delicious combination of peanuts caramel and nougat coated in chocolate
599983 running back to my locker after the swim i grabbed the bar and took a big bite you might be able to guess the rest it was entirely covered with ants i cried and cried thinking that these ants were crawling around in my stomach which they were i ran to my brother crying and he told me not to be such a baby it took many years for me to eat an oh henry again
599984 i knew that this was something that i had to tell my mom but my only communication with my parents was through letters i was embarrassed by the whole thing and did not want my dad to know so when i composed the letter i wrote on the envelope do not let dad read this i wrote the letter fast not caring about spelling and i happened to spell cramps as craps something to this day that i have not lived down
599985 our then 11 year old dubbed the foul tasting water at camp egg water and begged us to send water
599986 this was before bottled water was widely popular and we didnt see how we could send water in an envelope
599987 we were each handed a small styrofoam boat with a candle on it we walked down to the shore line and let the candle boat float out onto the lake the twinkling lights of the flames on the dark water was an awesome sight as though a thousand fireflies glittered in the dark night and my summer started to fade away as the boat floated farther and farther away
599988 just like that like in an old time movie everything was in slow motion my wallet falling out of my pocket slowly falling and falling till it hits the bottom of the latrine
599989 what a dilemma what was i to do all was not lost because the adult leaders were sympathetic to my crying plight so along with their assistance i was able to retrieve the gross smelly wallet it was all i could to do to gingerly open it and retrieve the stuff inside
