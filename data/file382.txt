3820016 oilers score for prostate cancer research at the cross cancer institute
3820017 this is a terrific program which has the opportunity to have the entire community involved
3820018 we are very proud of the programs we undertake and support in our community people have always given generously to a variety of projects weve undertaken and this partnership with the oilers the cross cancer institute and the alberta cancer foundation will no doubt strike a special note and also be very successful
3820019 there is a long history between the alberta cancer foundation the cross cancer institute and our players particularly glenn anderson
3820020 this program is not only a high profile method for creating a significant contribution to aid in prostate cancer research but it resonates throughout our community because its easy for individuals and corporate partners to get involved when glenn came back to edmonton today to be a part of the 20th anniversary of our cross cancer golf classic it seemed like the perfect time to launch this program and really make a significant contribution to helping with prostate cancer research
3820021 we are pleased and honoured that the edmonton oilers community foundation has stepped forward to raise funds and awareness for prostate cancer the mostly commonly diagnosed cancer today one in seven men and more than 2 400 albertans will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year it is the reality of this statistic that brings ua all together in the fight to conquer prostate cancer
3820022 putting glenns number up with the other honoured players at rexall place is absolutely deserving and its the right thing for our organization to do
3820023 glenn could bring fans out of their seats with his unbelievable goals and they always seemed to be such timely goals especially in the playoffs being inducted into the hockey hall of fame is what should happen to a player of his stature and having 9 up with the others is also the perfect tribute to one of the greatest oilers

3820079 it will take a nothing left to lose mentality that is when we as a people will act
3820080 we have come here with the approval of the georgian people
3820081 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3820082 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around
3820083 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
3820084 i tell you with full responsibility that there are no russian tanks in gori today and there is no reason to be
3820085 prevent any aggressive ambitions on the part of the georgian leadership
3820086 let the world finally wake up and take the action and provide the real security for the region
3820087 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
3820088 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
3820089 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
3820090 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
3820091 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
3820092 right in front me no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
3820093 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
3820094 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
3820095 the fact russian forces have moved so far into georgian territory will be seen as an act of provocation
3820096 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of this ceasefire they pledged not to move from their positions and stop firing
3820097 what this adds up to however while we may have have a ceasefire on the ground this is an extraordinary show of russian force
3820098 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
3820099 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
3820100 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3820101 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3820102 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
3820103 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
3820104 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3820105 upon the withdrawal of georgian troops to their barracks russian troops will return to the territory of the russian federation
3820106 balkan type and world war ii type ethnic cleansing and purification campaigns
3820107 we are getting reports of large scale violation of human rights of the worst of the case
3820108 the town of tskhinvali was turned into grozny two by russian carpet bombardment and i really want people to go in and check and verify what kind of bombs are these re russia invades province of georgia after georgia attacks russians videos
3820109 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
3820110 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3820111 dude you are so fin hot hit me up and lets talk
3820112 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to insure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3820113 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or sea ports to conduct this mission
3820114 personally convey americas unwavering support for the government of georgia
3820115 the united states stands with the democratic government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3820116 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement to end this conflict
3820117 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3820118 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3820119 had credible reports that russia is violating the cease fire agreement including as bush mentioned the bombing of vessels and the blocking of the port which were very concerned about
3820120 americas reputation here since the cold war is going to hell now
3820121 we have been warning them a large scale russian invasion is coming
3820122 the state department told us the russians are not going to do that
3820123 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership
3820124 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3820125 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators mugabe and mutambara have agreed
3820126 all three parties must agree if there is to be an agreement there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
3820127 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3820128 i am quite certain that all the of the parties are determined to find a solution
3820129 no way dont ever do that thats just asking for problems
3820130 this administration s failure to hold contractors accountable is outrageous more and more government responsibilities are being passed along to private companies at huge cost to american taxpayers and at the same time more and more reports emerge of fraud waste and abuse in the contracting process this pattern must be brought to an end which is why i have introduced legislation to bring critically needed reform to the government contracting process and why im calling for an investigation to get to the bottom of this latest abuse of taxpayer resources
3820131 europe has to get engaged physically on the ground and europe has to stop that from happening
3820132 the european union cannot be indifferent to this war these massacres on our doorstep
3820133 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3820134 it just doesnt seem to me to be very smart in such a time of crisis to decide whether we should revert to the previous situation
3820135 only option to prevent similar acts of aggression and occupation of georgia in the future is to give it the nato membership action plan
3820136 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods
3820137 europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3820138 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis

3820152 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3820153 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3820154 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3820155 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3820156 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3820157 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3820158 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3820159 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3820160 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3820161 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3820162 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3820163 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3820164 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3820165 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3820166 before symptoms develop and you become aware of the bugs presence it has already begun to attack your cells similarly fish and other organisms are affected by contaminants before behavioral changes appear our technology detects heretofore undetectable changes to act as an early warning system
3820167 this means the technology could not only help monitor environmental quality but may be used to enforce important water quality standards
3820168 this study was all the more exciting to be a part of due to its potential applications in protecting human health
3820169 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
3820170 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
3820171 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
3820172 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
3820173 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
3820174 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
3820175 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
3820176 our hypothesis was that if we could artificially induce conditions like those produced by the armstrong strain it would help the immune system clear an infection by clone 13
3820177 flying around all day to find nectar and pollen from flowers is hard work so it makes sense that bees are more likely to respond to the pheromone when honey reserves are low

3820182 you stared the devil directly in the face and you never looked away and when you finally did we knew that we found you
3820183 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3820184 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3820185 we are preparing the initial steps towards beta and are ready to open up our register your interest sign up page

3820187 yes i dont know where your moral compass is pointing
3820188 until the teams in the premier league play football to win which is never going to happen
3820189 committed to reaching an agreement that upholds the will of the people
3820190 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3820191 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008
3820192 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which had asked for time to reflect
3820193 without further delay we are demanding that ngos be allowed to resume humanitarian assistance distributing food medicines and life saving assistance this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
3820194 she hasnt made any unusual demands and has been very cooperative
3820195 she had bite marks on her face cheek head arms legs chest torso everywhere
3820196 literally bruised from head to toe from the top of her head all throughout her body all the way to the big toe on her right foot
3820197 massive bruising on the head and then her little fingers were lacerated toes
3820198 i cried my eyes out it will stay with me for the rest of my life
3820199 bite marks throughout her body there were old and new
3820200 she had bleeding on the brain both old and new which means she had been abused physically her entire life
3820201 it tests you to the point youre not sure you can speak
3820202 if the judges continue to sentence to the maximum under the new law the law is sufficient
3820203 but if a judge doesnt sentence them to the maximum to try to give some sort of deterrent effect to the rest of the community weve lost
3820204 she was full of bruises that were old green brown yellow colored
3820205 had they reported it early had they and insisted on that child not being abused maybe we would have never had her death take place
3820206 i think perhaps we ought to try to make it five years at least
3820207 i would go for something like that and i would certainly try it
3820208 i think a lot of proactive still needs to happen as far as young parents need to have proper education proper support systems
3820209 i feel a lot of young parents are struggling by themselves
3820210 they dont have anywhere to turn and it is the chemistry of child abuse
3820211 the community felt that baby brianna could be their child their granddaughter their daughter their niece
3820212 they were asked and they said they just wanted to be left alone and they wanted brianna to be left alone
3820213 my first thought was lets not talk about whats occurred here
3820214 before they started the autopsy and her little face was lying on a white sheet and i thought she looks asleep
3820215 theres a photograph of her to carry on of her little life
3820216 its a reminder of course of why we do what we do
3820217 if you forget youll either become calloused or you will become jell o
3820218 you cant do this job well unless you are in the middle and thats just a good reminder why we do it
3820219 it drives me to work harder to prevent to be a voice for every child of abuse
3820220 melting pot of performance and reading from novelists poets playwrights and low comedians

3820452 while the social networking trend first took off in north america it is beginning to reach a point of maturity in the region

3820454 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year

3820542 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias taxpayers and this years budget process but the states leaders have failed to act
3820543 therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3820544 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3820545 you always say such weird things who thinks about things like that
3820546 and if it does the sea is just there were not scientists were idols we dont have to think about these things

3820621 el torneo ol mpico era un objetivo sab a que no llegaba en la mejor forma posible y eso se vio en los momentos claves del encuentro

3820641 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3820642 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures

3820678 i was lucky the ref stopped so quickly it but one more punch would have done it anyway
3820679 im made up because the lads were gutted after little joe murray and this will have given them a lift i also proved that these russians are not unbeatable
3820680 audley harrison fought a russian in his first fight in sydney which proved to be his toughest test and went on to win the gold maybe it is an omen the thing about dave is that his punching power is improving all the time now hes the real deal

3820690 so what hes saying is hey im the guy in charge here im the person who decides what to do not you is that right
3820691 i think what he was saying was if i become president then ill be the person that calls the shots
3820692 the challenge is equivalent to trying to capture a sharp unsmeared picture of a roadside billboard about a mile away with a 2 000mm telephoto lens held out the window of a car moving at 50mph
3820693 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3820694 we are aware of the issue on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
3820695 i live in downtown los angeles where 3g coverage is a given and not only is the 3g wonky and unreliable but oftentimes im struggling to even get decent edge support
3820696 edge is absolutely worse on my new 3g than it ever was on my first generation iphone
3820697 id rather go outside into the cold and spend a couple of hours polishing my wheel nuts

3820703 there was a 2 minute delay so the world feed could get alicias routine into the world feed
3820704 that was unfortunate but it is not unusual the hold could have had an effect on alicia
3820705 i have no way to know it possibly could be possibly not
3820706 i told her alicia they tried to break your focus you let them do that never let them do that we work on that
3820707 in my opinion it was an attempt to break concentration thats exactly what happened
3820708 unfortunately she is the type of gymnast who is very emotional
3820709 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3820710 it just doesnt seem to me to be very smart in such a time of crisis to decide whether we should revert to the previous situation
3820711 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods
3820712 europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient

3820718 in addition we will simultaneously debut fog mountain featuring the first organically farmed california nouveau in 750ml pet bottles to highlight our commitment to reducing the wine worlds carbon footprint by producing locally
3820719 it is critical in todays time with the scarcity of our planets resources and the known environmental impacts of human activity that we consider whether we should still ship thousands of cases of wine in heavy bottles via air throughout the world in order for the wines to arrive on time for their annual release date in november when we can reduce fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions by more than half through a responsible choice of packaging

3820725 temos de fazer de tudo para sermos campe es ao menos do segundo turno pois assim sairemos dessa situa o com certeza por isso o empate n o serve para a gente a n o ser uma vez ou outra jogando fora de casa mas de maneira geral o empate n o serve
3820726 sinceramente eu acho que n o tem mais ressaca j passou eles t m de ter orgulho de ter chegado decis o ainda mais eliminando grandes times como s o paulo e boca juniors
3820727 o jogo contra a r ssia muito dif cil um time que joga forte no saque e bloqueio se voc perder a paci ncia voc se perde na partida temos que meter press o o tempo todo
3820728 a r ssia complicada um time alto de muita for a mas a nossa equipe guerreira eles v o sacar forte mas a gente tem que jogar com paci ncia n o podemos bater de frente temos que fazer a bola girar rapidamente
3820729 aparte de por m juego por mi pa s y eso es una motivaci n extra

3820739 all of the fallen dead trees will be taken to canfor pulp we are quite fortunate they are taking them they are not worth anything and without somewhere to take them we probably would not be able to do this work
3820740 we have seen people who are curious about the equipment come and rip the tape off closed areas to see what is happening this is a disregard for their safety trails such as the greenway are still open however forests for the world is closed until further notice
3820741 you have got to be kidding me im totally busted
3820742 sam im way too tired to play this game right now
3820743 ill carry you but you will have to do something for me too
3820744 we continue to be very pleased with the reaction from customers we see in the market
3820745 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
3820746 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
3820747 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
3820748 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
3820749 our impression is and the feedback we got from our members is that the opposition is very significant
3820750 the feedback especially from the small to medium businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support
3820751 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3820752 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then peace can come
3820753 the rebel military installations and civilian areas are mixed if the army advances further and confines the rebels into a smaller region then civilian vulnerability will increase
3820754 there are no restrictions and there is no shortage we send food and other essentials as per the request of the senior government official in those areas
3820755 the silence of the international community especially by neighbouring india over the displacement and suffering of tamils is disturbing
3820756 uh yeah i had an inservice day they let us out
3820757 theyre pretty mean to me sir um i mean bill i just wish i could be home schooled someday ill have my own band and this place this school will be a fucking memory

3820761 personally i think ssds are a terrible replacement for hybrid hard drives hhds at this time for a lot of reasons the biggest of which is that they havent been around long enough to know how they really will perform in heavy duty production situations
3820762 there are about 60 flash vendors and about 17 organizations doing some kind of standards work
3820763 but i never saw anyone else like family or kids

3820765 bale telah menandatangani kontrak baru yang menandakan komitmennya kepada klub hingga tahun 2012
3820766 for one he doesnt have the means you have to have several people to carry out a coup
3820767 he is being persecuted on the basis of rumours he is the victim of a military and political conspiracy
3820768 so how can they accuse him of wanting to overthrow the regime in those circumstances
3820769 the deal is not sustainable and it is not going to solve the crisis the country is experiencing
3820770 zanu pf is not prepared to concede power they would rather divide conquer and rule
3820771 whatever they do they should not ignore the morgan tsvangirai faction as this would result in a serious legitimacy crisis for any government that will be formed
3820772 there is no way the economy will recover if sanctions imposed by western countries are still in place
3820773 his only option is to participate in the negotiation process but there is not much he can do to force mugabe to make concessions
3820774 wildfire fighters are nearing exhaustion as the fires rage on firefighters from stutterheim have been working since tuesday first to bring the addo fire under control and now the one in makana

3820779 into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3820780 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3820781 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3820782 why the extreme leftism of an obama presidency would leave the united states weakened diminished and divided why obama must be defeated and how he can be
3820783 this book is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited written by an individual who was discredited after he wrote a similar book to help george bush and vice president dick cheney get re elected four years ago
3820784 its interesting you know theyre both the same age theyre both monster superstars cultural myths almost from the 1980s into the 1990s but in so many ways theyre hard to compare
3820785 one could argue that as a musician a dancer and an entertainer michael jackson has it all over madonna by a factor of 10
3820786 hes the guy whos up there with frank sinatra bing crosby elvis presley one of the top musical performers in our cultural history
3820787 it didnt sell as well as her music did a few years ago but it was a number one album and if anyone has ever proven that shes able of reinventing herself thats madonna
3820788 madonna has managed to stay creative and to stay relevant i think she still is in the popular music scene
3820789 i dont know what shell be like at 60 but mick jagger is there and hes rocking and rolling
3820790 theres no shrewder businesswoman she could probably run a music studio
3820791 he got to the point that he was so rich so powerful and so famous that he was allowed to kind of withdraw from any kind of reality
3820792 michael jackson is the example of someone who was truly spoiled and by spoiled i mean ruined by the level of fame that he achieved
3820793 he accidentally turned himself into a parody of himself and then its kind of hard to re emerge as a serious performer
3820794 i dont think its impossible i think hes still got talent but then you tie that in with the trial and that made an awful lot of people terribly uncomfortable
3820795 jackson withstood a trial which was very ugly and was vindicated the idea that he could be a paedophile having that in the news is not going to make your career any good
3820796 jeder kann in risikosituationen kommen in denen er sich anstecken kann zum beispiel auf reisen

3820800 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3820801 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3820802 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3820803 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3820804 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3820805 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3820806 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3820807 the member area is great it is helping me become a good independent trader and has given me new systems that i can really use also the market monitor from members area is great for market direction and early warning system you have your fingers on the pulse of the market better than paid service or blog i have ever read and let me tell you that says alot
3820808 the member area helps me to become a knowledgeable independent trader
3820809 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3820810 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3820811 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3820812 we dont worry about coming back to be no 1 but we want to be driven by outstanding cars and trucks the latest technology and participating in the world market overall
3820813 while we are cutting costs across the organization it is important to note that we intend to increase our investment in research and development projects which will remain the lifeblood of the company
3820814 we are also actively evaluating a number of companies as potential acquisition targets
3820815 when the spread between those two variables is shrinking the environment tends to be more conducive to transactions
3820816 if i look ahead in the coming 12 months it is a better environment than the last two or three years have been
3820817 a number of factors inimical to growth have intensified in 2008
3820818 no country except the large commodity exporting nations can perhaps expect to emerge unscathed from such adverse worldwide conditions
3820819 inflation growth and other macro economic outcomes are all likely to be severely impacted
3820820 theres a slowdown in agriculture industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth this will affect the indian economy
3820821 be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets
3820822 the risk is that an abrupt slowing in asia could occur sometime in late 2008 to early 2009
3820823 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3820824 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3820825 im concerned because somebodys going to be making a lot of money on this
3820826 the footprint of these giant wind turbines is so huge that its affecting the wild prairie chickens

3820831 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3820832 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3820833 well apparently within the framework of well prepared plan several hundred pieces of russian equipment russian airborne troops commanded by head of airborne troops of russia certain with the rank of general landed there and expelled and certainly killed part of the population the whole population from that place is gone this is classical case of ethnic cleansing
3820834 what i least want is for somebody to take advantage of the image of manfred to bring about a confrontation between members of cochabamba residents thats why today i am letting the secretary general of the prefecture to continue this work while i conduct the pertinent legal affairs and while i show that the decree of the electoral court was harmful to justice in bolivia
3820835 told me that he will kill me and chop my body into pieces

3820860 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3820861 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3820862 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3820863 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3820864 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3820865 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3820866 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3820867 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3820868 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3820869 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3820870 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this

3820921 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3820922 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3820923 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3820924 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade

3820981 the downside risk to our growth expectations in 2008 09 is primarily from a further deterioration in global conditions with its attendant impact on india be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets
3820982 the increase in oil and commodity prices is damaging corporate profits while rising inflation is hurting households

3820990 it was decided because of this will that the old horse would be taken back to crosskennan where everything possible would be done to give him the best chance of recovery
3820991 the sanctuary has been told by several people that this old horse was one of the horses that helped mickey marley to bring his famous roundabout to belfast city centre giving joy to a generation of children
3820992 mickey who sadly died in 2005 would have been shocked and appalled to see how his once doted on horse and companion was left to die in such a heartless way
3820993 a once well loved horse can very easily through injury or behaviour problem be displaced into the welfare system if the old mallusk horse named marley by volunteers that gave so much happiness and was held in such affection can end up left to starve then what hope have the rest
3820994 horse owners should take heed be responsible for their horses life and death when the time comes and allow them to die with dignity without pain

3821013 come i will show you the punishment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters 2 with her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries
3821014 why are you astonished i will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides which has the seven heads and ten horns
3821015 this calls for a mind with wisdom the seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits
3821016 the ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast 13 they have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast 14 they will make war against the lamb but the lamb will overcome them because he is lord of lords and king of kings and with him will be his called chosen and faithful followers
3821017 the waters you saw where the prostitute sits are peoples multitudes nations and languages 16 the beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute they will bring her to ruin and leave her naked they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire 17 for god has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule until gods words are fulfilled 18 the woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth
3821018 fallen fallen is babylon the great she has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil a spirit a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird 3 for all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries the kings of the earth committed adultery with her and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries

3821031 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3821032 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3821033 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3821037 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3821038 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3821039 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3821040 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3821041 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3821052 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3821056 the countrys invaders should be paying billions in reparations not using the war as a reason to pillage its richest resource
3821057 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
3821058 while current high oil prices will provide a boon to central government finances this year we expect the budget to fall into deficit in 2009 and for deficits to widen over the forecast period
3821059 oil revenues to contract around 17 in 2009 and then to continue to fall but at a slower rate over the remainder of the forecast period 2008 2012
3821060 we therefore expect current expenditure to continue to grow and for investment expenditure to increase at double digit rates over the forecast period

3821111 the students of cu play a key role in creating the community of the surrounding boulder neighborhoods

3821128 as we better understand the biological pathways that regulate the growth of stem cells we may identify new approaches for treating blood disorders
3821129 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
3821130 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
3821131 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
3821132 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses

3821145 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3821146 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3821147 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make

3821181 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions

3821191 we felt good out there its almost as if we earned a point but real madrid must win no matter where it plays this match will serve to learn from the mistakes made we cannot allow the same mistakes against valencia we must score next sunday and win
3821192 i am very happy with the way things are going for me in madrid this was not a friendly for either side because both have official matches coming up and the players want to make statements to their coaches madrid was the better team but their keeper prevented us from winning
3821193 i felt good for having only trained for two weeks the second half was better our goal is still the champions league but we know how important the league is

3821234 i just want to stay focused and be relaxed when i get out there and hopefully be able to repeat my performance from the other night with a couple of cleaner events
3821235 ive known now for at least two months that id be competing all around so ive had a lot of practice getting ready to compete in six events and i knew i had a pretty good chance of making the final

3821303 i enjoyed a pricey but genuinely fun celebratory meal at this location of gyu kaku with two of my best friends last month and i have to say
3821304 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving

3821316 any temporary decrease in violence in iraq has had less to do with the 20 000 additional troops and more to do with the 10 per day the bush administration is paying iraqis not to resist this war is the largest armed robbery in history it has nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction saddam hussein democracy or anything good and noble it has to do with enriching large multinational corporations it is time for the war to end and for the people of iraq and palestine to live in freedom and dignity

3821325 his economic advisers ignore all evidence from 30 years of failure to promote the ideologies of private for profit medicine and they try to trash effective government programs the corporate for profit health insurance industry skims 500 billion a year out of health insurance premiums for their own administration and profit a sum of money which is equal to the annual budget of the pentagon without the costs of the war and is enough to pay for health care for all 47 million americans who dont already have it a number that has gone up by 7 million since bush entered office
3821326 show that were taking responsibility for whats happening even though the bush administration isnt
3821327 they needed time to finalize their contract procedures and budget the money
3821328 explosions known as shots result from destructive tests of high explosives 100 to 200 of them a year in the last 10 years
3821329 with no more than one detonation occurring in any given hour
3821330 du weapons kill in inhumane ways causing cancers kidney problems eye problems lung diseases and according to the medical researchers who have investigated it many other serious conditions additionally du weapons cause disabilities in the children of those exposed cranial facial anomalies missing limbs grossly deformed and non viable infants and the like so in this sense are teratogenic
3821331 as these conditions can occur to non combatants or may arise long after military operations have concluded du weapons are necessarily inhumane the teratogenic nature of du weapons raises the possibility of a genocidal effect finally du weapons unduly contaminate the natural environment including water and agricultural land necessary for the subsistence of the civilian population for beyond the lifetime of that population
3821332 testing was part of the resolution including stockpiling and trafficking its not actually as clear as actual use in combat whether the mere presence for instance of a nuclear bomb in your arsenal is a violation and a number of countries have nuclear weapons in their arsenals
3821333 does not view du subject to test ban treaties and therefore there is no international restriction on the testing
3821334 i would argue that there is an inherent violation of human rights if a weapon that releases dangerous substances is tested in an area where there are people who could be negatively affected from that perspective carrying out say a depleted uranium test open air in the bay area is a crime a violation of international law from the perspective of the right to life the right to health and those kinds of rights
3821335 its not so much a violation of humanitarian law because the weapon isnt used in combat the fact that it is a weapon and could be and is intended to be used in combat doesnt make a test of it a combat exercise
3821336 depleted uranium weapons release dangerous substances and so from that perspective it becomes what we call a kind of a tort only because its a dangerous substance its a strict liability and the united states is on notice that there are health consequences of depleted uranium they of course downplay them but they have never denied that there arent any
3821337 and there isnt any way that you can carry out a depleted uranium open air test or an open air test of weapons containing depleted uranium without it having some effect on a very heavily populated northern california area the central valley as a whole is fairly heavily populated and im certain that within a 50 to 100 mile radius of where theyre testing there are considerable population groups
3821338 i just think again theres no prohibition in our conflict law because theyre not being used in combat however there are probably prohibitions in a number of other areas including of course human rights but also in environmental the environmental aspect which is part of the four point test so you can have environmental and personal damage damage to people that would be the united states in violation of its own law in many many areas
3821339 well their human rights law the united states has a duty to promote and protect the right to health so if youre detonating weapons that causes illnesses preventable youve violated that
3821340 obviously environmental laws both state and federal laws about releasing dangerous substances the release of dangerous substances is in a sense automatically a violation of what we call domestic law or tort law its a strict liability violation meaning theres no defense its not like its negligence its not like the us could be sued for negligence because of injury in the case of hazardous substances its strict liability its hazardous stuff its strict liability it means that there is no defense its as if the united states wasnt properly maintaining a dam and the dam burst the us cant use any arguments in its defense saying well we didnt have adequate budget for maintenance its strict liability the dam busts youre liable
3821341 under human rights law you cant do it in the first place its not just a question of who pays for the damage and one of the reasons the united states has been so blatantly mendacious about depleted uranium is to generate confusion as to what exactly does it do so the government is taking advantage of what it expects to be elements of proof in a legal action and its been very clever they have taken many many defensive postures in anticipation
3821342 i did indeed have a hand in the draft principles
3821343 protection and preservation of the air soil water sea ice flora and fauna and the essential processes and areas necessary to maintain biological diversity and ecosystems

3821345 states and all other parties shall avoid using the environment as a means of war or inflicting significant long term or widespread harm on the environment and shall respect international law providing protection for the environment in times of armed conflict and cooperate in its further development

3821351 the most engaging rock show we ve ever seen this band must be caught in an intimate setting while you still can
3821352 the silent years seem to balance traditional pop rock influences like the beatles with some guitar years radiohead poppy sonic youth and wilco elements that make them more than a rehash of years past

3821354 this illuminating and remarkably impressive book should be leaked into the government this book could awaken officials to withdraw their complicity and tell the truth to the public this country will not escape further human legal and moral catastrophes or preserve itself as a democratic constitutional republic if that does not happen if youre at all like me you will have a whole set of new heroes when you finish reading this dissent voices of conscience could change your life
3821355 voices of conscience are usually smothered in spin that the stories of these heroes are recorded here gives me great hope and shows that it is still possible to do the right thing

3821358 we look at it as a different dimension the laws of physics are different here star wars is not science fiction at all its much more attuned to mythology to psychology to history than it is to science

3821361 one of the world war ii pearl harbor survivors said his grandson had just returned from iraq alive
3821362 two months later his grandson committed suicide later that afternoon i received a call from a gold star mother a woman whos lost a son or daughter in a foreign war who was having trouble dealing with her depression nobody seems to know about the pain and suffering this war is causing
3821363 but that we should just continue to do what we were doing so we could get north viet nam to the peace table we were asked to keep killing people because congress didnt have the courage to end the war
3821364 i have two sons of draftable age and i dont want my sons to go to a non winnable war
3821365 ive been a single parent for 21 years and for 20 of those years i had no health coverage
3821366 any time i had a situation with either of my sons i had to pay 800 up front just for tests before they even found out what was wrong with them or offered any care that is an exorbitant fee
3821367 she only knew i was on my way because shed called me
3821368 we cannot help you we have a good relationship with titan
3821369 whatever we can do together so this suffering doesnt go on should be our obligation
3821370 the only way to continue a war is to fund it
3821371 my aunt told me that they way they finally ended the viet nam war was they focused their lobbying on the house appropriations committee to end the funding and eventually they did that is the only way to bring this war to a responsible end in may 2007 when an open ended funding bill came to the house floor it passed with the support of 87 democrats
3821372 to take money from veterans programs and other things the public supports
3821373 i say let bush and cheney bear the brunt of it
3821374 of course theyll say you dont support the troops if you dont support the war
3821375 copass said that the house democrats should have hung together defeated the war funding on a party line vote if necessary and impeached bush and cheney if they attempted to continue the war by shifting money out of other programs to pay for it
3821376 there is another funding bill 179 billion that was supposed to be voted on last week it combines 70 billion in carry over funding through 2009 and another 101 billion for operations after that this will commit us to the occupation for three more years
3821377 and they said they did not want to end the war because they wanted it as a political issue to use against the republicans in 2008
3821378 congress needs to listen to the voice of the american people
3821379 two thirds of them oppose the war the enormous drain of the war on the u s treasury is the reason why we cant afford health care not even for children there is a universal health care bill before congress hr 676 kucinich conyers and we need to make it a priority for the next congress to get that passed any further consideration of funding for iraq should be contingent on full care for gis and a six to 12 month timetable for withdrawal
3821380 we were told we had to stay there because the north viet namese would take over
3821381 now bush is over there shaking hands with the president of viet nam if we dont decide collectively to get out of iraq we never will
3821382 i was in korea and they said the dominoes would fall
3821383 war is not the answer its an illegitimate war we have no right to be there we need to invoke the geneva court everything about it is illegal we need to realign our priorities from top to bottom we could realign 2 5 million every week just by ending the war we need to realign our priorities at the federal state regional and local levels
3821384 the role of government is to defend the liberties of the people and represent what they desire there are enormous untapped reserves of talent from the american people including our troops the country was born from people who dreamed john fitzgerald kennedy said we were going to put a man on the moon within the decade and we did thats the kind of vision we need now to solve our countrys problems and not waste resources fighting in illegal immoral and unjust wars
3821385 one of the resolutions adopted by caucus delegates called on longshore workers to stop work during the day shift on may 1 2008 to express their opposition to the war in iraq

3821905 hes available to pinch hit i just didnt think he was well enough to play nine innings i thought about dh ing him but were not there
3821906 if we didnt have thursday off he still wouldnt have played today what it allows us is an extra day to heal
3821907 i find it laughable watchdog groups would go this route considering sen mccain chaired the senate indian affairs committee that investigated jack abramoff i suggest they take a closer look at barack obamas friends like convicted felon tony rezko or his national co chairman harry reid who took nearly 68 000 from abramoff
3821908 reeds hypocrisy is legion now matched only by john mccains attending a fundraiser hes helping host

3821911 i cant bring harden back on short rest but i can bring marquis back possibly
3821912 by him pitching the day game it gives him a little longer time if not well either pitch samardzija or pitch sean marshall
3821913 like i said when i first got here i just want to come in and throw whenever they want to give me a shot and take it as far as i can take it

3821922 i think well look back on it when the seasons over
3821923 were 1 500 miles from everything nothing is going to happen fast here
3821924 its first year players in billings mont guys still have their college attitudes here but they came in with an idea of how to pitch i dont claim to know everything i watch and listen i told them most of my education came from trial and error theyre pretty receptive to the program set up by the reds and former reds pitching coach vern ruhle when he was here
3821925 its helped me that ive had success at the big league level
3821926 it gives me credibility with the players in some regard
3821927 i invented nothing and i dont claim to know everything i was a good listener and paid attention i was fortunate to have been around some pretty good players and coaches
3821928 theyre great kids id trade places with them with no guarantees just for the opportunity to try it again

3821937 i asked why i shouldnt i bring her and was told by the border guard that because she was disabled she had a lifetime ban
3821938 i have never ever in my whole life seen such blatant discrimination lucy is different and therefore in their eyes not perfect
3821939 i kept saying to them so because my daughter is disabled you are telling me she cant come in and they simply said yes

3821945 many potential workflows exist right now from film based motion picture delivery to all digital game engine delivery
3821946 people are finding that they need to manage color across multiple creative toolsets facilities and pipelines color symmetry 2 0 is about introducing features that let users quickly bring their applications and pipelines up to the industry standards for color data exchange and allow them to access common color tools for manipulating imagery regardless of whether the imagery originated digitally or on film or whether it will be mastered digitally or on film

3821977 we started playing that one right out of the gate so weve played that a lot
3821978 and i really dont know i hate to sound like its all about money but as i get older is about taking care of my family and paying my bills and making a living but that doesnt mean that i dont want to go as far as music can take me
3821979 solitario tu vai per la strada di colui che ama

3821985 but we have a serious home grown pollution problem right here and canadians ranging from the very young to the very old are paying the price
3821986 both of which rise during pollution episodes and in the few days afterwards and explain in significant part the number of acute deaths due to air pollution
3821987 canada gets a fair bit of pollution from the american midwest which drifts north comes across through ontario and continues right on through to quebec
3821988 sometimes people in rural areas think theyre escaping very nicely because they dont live in downtown wherever the fact is these masses of air pollution move across the countryside and some of our worst air pollution occurs in rural areas because it just happens to be downwind
3821989 this report shows for the first time the tragic effects of the toxic air that we breathe whether it is in my hometown of vancouver or across the country in st johns

3822044 we played a good game tonight against australia and now we will face a difficult contest against nigeria
3822045 the quarter final will be a classic african match up between two teams that know each other very well it should be interesting we have some good players with good qualities and hopefully we can keep going
3822046 it is a commitment we have made to the international community and we have a responsibility to keep it
3822047 from the further affidavits of the plaintiffs it is clear that there was a dispute over the boundaries between nigeria and cameroon and the international court of justice icj delivered judgment dated 10th october 2002 the part of the territory these plaintiffs have brought before this court was involved in the area litigated upon at the icj since the issue had been determined at that level the decision binds all sovereign states that are members of united nations and no forum domesticum of member states can assume jurisdiction to review again what has been decided by the icj

3822052 the one day game is totally different and the indians have a different team altogether they only have three or four guys from the test squad who remain
3822053 we just have to make sure that we get our game plan right again and focus on what we need to do we had a couple of days off and we will start training tomorrow we will start preparing as we prepare for any tournament and get our focus back
3822054 for us it is a team game we are not worried what mendis will do out there he is just an individual in our team unit and he is going to execute a game plan thats what we want him to do whether he picks up the wickets or whether he is going to make impact were not worried about it
3822055 for us it is all about to wanting to finish the game whether we won it by one run of by one wicket that is what matters to us
3822056 i am very happy with the squad not sure whether it has been finalised
3822057 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products

3822114 at the end of the day ill take it right between the eyes if that means that hurts our sport to me thats an oxymoron how can you be punished for being good at something it seems like its not what sport is all about

3822136 the jurisdictional and due process conclusions contained in the trial courts 7 may 2007 order were fully and fairly litigated and finally decided in illinois circuit court
3822137 t his finding concludes our review and forecloses any reconsideration of the merits of the legal issues decided by the illinois circuit court while we share the trial courts serious concerns regarding the final accounting in the settlement we are constrained to hold that the trial court erred by refusing to accord full faith and credit to the settlement we therefore reverse the trial courts 7 may 2007 order and remand this case to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the class action allegations with prejudice

3822182 my job is to get a good performance from the players which the club makes available to me
3822183 during the past month that we have been together i have been very pleased with his performance not only on the pitch but in terms of his relationship with his teammates
3822184 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the us and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe
3822185 then it got tighter than i would have wanted it to
3822186 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3822187 lieberman has jumped the shark because he is saying without actually saying it that obama is potentially a traitor if not one already a patriot puts his country first so who is craven enough to put his country second the fact is this the old joe lieberman and the old john mccain wouldnt suggest or come close to calling obama unpatriotic because he disagrees with them they would have aggressively challenged him on his positions but never questioned his bona fides as someone who cared for his country
3822188 barack obama needs to tell the public that this gutter approach to politics will be americas problem if john mccain is elected president because if he and his crowd campaign this way theyll govern this way by dividing the country questioning the patriotism of anyone who disagrees with them and going into character assassination mode whenever theyre challenged
3822189 the questions no longer whether joementums going to split with the democrats its whether hes going to do it in dramatic fashion during his speech to the republican convention or whether hell leave it to reid to push him out by stripping him of his committee assignments if youre reid do you take his assignments away now or chance having him take the stage with a national audience and tell the democrats you cant fire me i quit you dont want to antagonize him before he speaks but since hes already taken the gloves off why not cast him out beforehand or will that backfire by letting him use his speech to play the victim shunned by a party establishment that cant tolerate dissent within its own ranks
3822190 if joe lieberman honestly believes what hes saying then why did he urge barack obama to run for president in the first place
3822191 as for lieberman just last week the former democrat contributed 100 000 to the dscc a lieberman friendly democrat told roll call why lieberman made the donation basically he doesnt want everybody to hate him plus he wants to keep his committee at this point dems everywhere are going to hate him and hes going to lose his committee looking at the big picture this is quite obviously the end of liebermans relationship with the democratic party lieberman might as well kiss his committee gavel goodbye and once that happens hell have no incentive to caucus with the party lieberman probably realizes this which will make him an unrestrained republican attack dog throughout the campaign cycle i still wonder though if lieberman has considered the implications for his reputation not with the party and not with his constituents but with the media establishment he loves and which loves him right back liebermans interesting to pundits and talking heads because hes unusual the media cant get enough of unusual lieberman was on the democratic ticket eight years ago he had obama campaigning for him two years ago and now hes mccains mini me the media cant get enough but come january if hes just another republican hack hes not quite as fascinating anymore
3822192 another day another unsightly smear of obama from joe lieberman
3822193 and so the evolution from hawkish democrat to republican attack dog continues what lieberman is doing is what a vice presidential candidate tends to do savage the opponent or more accurately what rove republican vice presidential candidates have been trained to do savage the opponent as a traitor its funny but i dont recall him ever being so aggressive when he was gores running mate
3822194 the talk wont go away until a sen john mccain picks somebody else to be his running mate on the republican ticket or b mccain picks lieberman
3822195 ever since their diaspora jews have been accused of putting something else themselves the dispersed israelite people then israel itself ahead of their own country jewish citizens of russia germany and america to pick just a few have been slandered and sometimes killed for allegedly putting their allegiances to the hebrew nation ahead of their patriotism toward the motherland the fatherland or the homeland this is vintage protocols of the elders of zion and yet what do we hear today from orthodox jew joe lieberman does joe lieberman not realize that he is using one of the oldest anti semitic tricks in the book to accuse obama of being the islamic candidate
3822196 i parse it as saying put the country first in legislation which is not questioning ones patriotism but rather a common parliamentary elocution we must put our country first and compromise on campaign reform mccain has reached out across the aisle many many times obama hasnt reasonable minds may disagree with this interpretation but the reaction was over the top
3822197 lieberman could have also added that we have a choice between one candidate who has always raised his hand for the national anthem and another who has not we have a choice between one candidate who spent 20 years in an anti american anti white church and another who did not we have a choice between one candidate who made a big deal out of the fact that he didnt want to wear a flag pin and another candidate who did not just pointing a few things out again because those are all relevant points people should keep in mind when they step into the voting booth
3822198 georgian pres mikheil saakashvili knows that the thoughts and prayers and support of the american people are with that brave little nation as they struggle today for their freedom and independence he wanted me to say thank you to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people i told him i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
3822199 so says john mccain it may be a noble sentiment and georgia is deserving of american diplomatic support but is he really speaking for all or even most americans my strong hunch is that precious few americans want to feel theyre the victims of russian aggression instead they want all the foreign policy madness to calm down already it hardly seems a winning message for mccain to imply that in their hearts the american people should consider themselves at war with russia
3822200 so today john mccain let me know that we are all georgians especially the guys on his staff being paid by their government i guess now russia and georgia set conditions for a cease fire and withdrawal under a french framework french so i guess by we are all georgians mccain means that we are all losers of brief wars where we belligerently try to take over breakaway regions by force using indiscriminate violence and suffer the consequences there are no noblemen in this conflict but to signal some kinship with the georgians is tantamount to allying with them in a dirty war against the russians which is just a fair bit of madness
3822201 i think i speak for most americans when i say does he mean the state
3822202 how would the trad media have portrayed barack obama if he had behaved as john mccain has done since georgian president saakashvili sent troops into south ossetia would it have been presumptuous to issue proposals to intervene in the fighting even before the president had spoken to stake out an aggressive position far in front of anything the us wished to adopt to attack a rival candidate for refusing to do the same what if he claimed to be able to speak for the nation
3822203 common sense indicates that no i am not a georgian but john mccain says today we are all georgians but does he mean it suppose russia was bombing atlanta and threatening to advance to savannah in solidarity with georgia the state americans from all fifty states would band together and fight the russians off now i dont think we should go to war with russia and i hope john mccain doesnt think we should go to war with russia but insofar as he doesnt mean that we should go to war with russia on georgias behalf whats the meaning of the claim that we are all georgians on one level its empty political sloganeering but on another level its not empty its downright irresponsible and an example of the sort of irresponsible behavior that got us into this but this stuff isnt a game putin shakashvili the ossetes and the abkhaz are all playing for keeps we shouldnt imply guarantees that we dont intend to keep which means the public statements of our officials have to be driven by realistic assessments of the situation and of american interests not by mawkish sentimentality
3822204 does yglesias really not understand this the point is that we cant physically defend georgia from russian agression but we can make a symbolic stand of unity with a democratic pro western state that has been attacked by an autocratic aggressor is yglesias trying to argue that since we dont have the capacity to intervene militarily we cant make basic moral judgments
3822205 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire
3822206 and people think this man is ready to lead hes not even living in the same century as the rest of us
3822207 many of us freaked out today when john mccain accused russia of imperial ambitions how does anyone arrive at that after reading about the situation between russia and georgia jesus but then again are we just getting soft think back to the glory days of the republican primary season all of the candidates launched into over the top fear babble of this nature on a daily basis and it was usually more insane
3822208 watching john mccain speak about the georgian crisis in the video below should deeply worry anyone interested in a sane us foreign policy or the safety of their children one arch joke from the earlier part of this decade was that the one good thing about the neocons obsession with getting into a war with iraq was that it distracted them from their much bigger obsessions ratcheting up cold wars with china and or russia the people that are pulling mccains strings are the people who want to push us into a new cold war with the russians and ironically and a bit improbably with the chinese too but the russians are probably more willing to oblige us since their power remains limited to oil reserves and military power in other words theyre people mccains folks can understand and vice versa but think for a moment where wed be if this man were president right now as he may well be in six months this man takes the counsel of the people who got us into the iraq war on foreign policy he is in league with the people who were so extreme theyve now largely been kicked out of the bush administration people like john bolton and others like him this man is simply too dangerous and unstable to be president people need to wake up and get a look of the preview hes giving us of a mccain presidency
3822209 barack obama enjoys a jog at hawaiis kailua beach keeping focused on his workout even as his fans try to snap photos meanwhile john mccain is campaigning in pennsylvania has twice spoken with the president of georgia and is working to prevent a close american ally from collapsing under the weight of a russian invasion
3822210 it seems the mccain campaign has decided to take advantage of the violent conflict in georgia to score political points against barack obama by criticizing him for going on vacation while mccain has twice spoken with the president of georgia and is working to prevent a close american ally from collapsing under the weight of a russian invasion but look nothing mccain is doing is actually helping georgia various diplomats from the united states the european union the united nations and elsewhere are trying to negotiate an end to the crisis obama is trying to relax before the hard months of campaigning ahead and mccain is engaged in political posturing and a lot of empty tough guy rhetoric thats better suited to a bill kristol column than to the white house a lot of the rhetoric about this situation has in my view been over the top but i think its clear that america has a real but limited interest in maintaining a georgia that isnt entirely under moscows thumb but whats needed are practical steps in that direction not empty sloganeering and political stunts
3822211 obama is not actually the antichrist because as those of us who follow these things know the antichrist is jewish several years ago i went to see jerry falwell in lynchburg where he confirmed this to me and offered up the ross on this subject and its a bit silly to think that true pre millenarian wackadoos believe that obama could be the antichrist because true pre millenarian wackadoos know that the antichrist is a jew unless of course obama is in fact jewish but you cant be christian and jewish and secretly muslim at the same time or can you
3822212 though there was no particular evidence that the tire gauge attack was having an effect the mccain campaigns glee was evident just days before they had alleged that obamas criticisms of their tactics constituted fussiness and hysteria and now here they were brandishing small phallic objects bearing their opponents name meanwhile mccain himself was sent out to pose in front of working oil rigs to testify to his thirst for pulling more black gold from the earth the message couldnt be plainer see that itty bitty little tire gauge if you vote for obama thats how big your penis is if you vote for mccain on the other hand your penis is as big as this rig thrusting its gigantic shaft in and out of the ground

3822217 there are difficult decisions ahead and we will pay a heavy price but it is our moral duty as commanders to do everything possible to bring gilad home safe and sound
3822218 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3822219 the whole world must know that ending the conflict requires an end to the israeli occupation of the lands that were occupied in 1967 including east jerusalem
3822220 there is no such thing as innocent work so long as the aksa mosque is under occupation
3822221 stable organizations that are connected with our movement and which fly in our orbit

3822223 i make this covenant to he who stands here today and also with he who is not here today
3822224 should take energetic measures to eliminate this phenomenon and ensure that authors of such acts of discrimination on the basis of religion are adequately deterred and sanctioned
3822225 attempts to identify islam with terrorism violence and human rights violations
3822226 freedom of expression may therefore be subject to certain restrictions necessary for the respect of the rights or reputations of others
3822227 it is regrettable that there are false translations and interpretations of the freedom of expression
3822228 islam on campus a survey of uk student opinion gives us a hint
3822229 that 32 percent of muslim students said killing in the name of religion could be justified while 60 of active members of on campus islamic societies said the same only 2 of non muslims polled felt this way
3822230 forty percent of muslim students polled supported the introduction of sharia islamic law into british law for muslims and a third supported the introduction of a worldwide caliphate based on sharia law
3822231 that most muslim students supported secularism and democratic values were generally tolerant of other minorities and rejected violence in the name of their faith
3822232 like their arab predecessors the ottomans were energetic empire builders in the name of jihad by the early 16th century they had conquered syria and egypt from the mamluks the formidable slave soldiers who had contained the mongols and destroyed the crusader kingdoms under sultan suleiman the magnificent they soon turned northward by the middle of the 17th century they seemed poised to overrun christian europe only to be turned back in fierce fighting at the gates of vienna in 1683 the ottomans defeat by the victorious european powers of world war i to say nothing of the work of mustafa kemal ataturk the father of modern turkish nationalism finally brought an end both to the ottoman caliphate itself and to islams centuries long imperial reach
3822233 although arabs are naturally attached to their native land their nationalism is not confined by boundaries it is an aspiration to restore the great tolerant civilization of the early caliphate
3822234 like the leaders of al qaida many muslims and arabs unabashedly pine for the reconquest of spain and consider their 1492 expulsion from the country a grave historical injustice waiting to be undone indeed as immigration and higher rates of childbirth have greatly increased the number of muslims within europe itself over the past several decades countries that were never ruled by the caliphate have become targets of muslim imperial ambition since the late 1980s islamists have looked upon the growing population of french muslims as proof that france too has become a part of the house of islam in britain even the more moderate elements of the muslim community are candid in setting out their aims
3822235 the fuel of islamic imperialism remains as volatile as ever and is very far from having burned itself out to deny its force is the height of folly and to imagine that it can be appeased or deflected is to play into its hands only when it is defeated and when the faith of islam is no longer a tool of islamic political ambition will the inhabitants of muslim lands and the rest of the world be able to look forward to a future less burdened by jihadists and their gory dreams
3822236 someone has to go back and get a shitload of dimes
3822237 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3822238 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3822239 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3822240 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3822241 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3822242 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3822243 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well
3822244 the two musicians are no strangers to political activism organizing the no nukes concerts way back in 1979 with john hall of orleans now congressman john hall d n y
3822245 just give me the warm power of the sun give me the steady flow of a waterfall give me the spirit of living things as they return to clay just give me the restless power of the wind give me the comforting glow of a wood fire but please take all your atomic poison power away
3822246 that would add significantly to the nations current fleet of which produce about 20 of the nations power
3822247 including safety waste storage vulnerability to terrorist attack and concerns about weapons proliferation
3822248 so its going to be nukes and offshore drilling and thats going to solve our energy problems
3822249 there appears to be more open minds when it comes to nuclear energy but there is a great divide both in political party and gender
3822250 nuclear plants today are very safe and the new nuclear power plants will be even safer
3822251 is projected to grow more than twice as fast as committed resources over the next 10 years
3822252 the nuclear industry says its one of the cleanest cheapest ways to produce power
3822253 nuclear energy is the only electricity source that can generate electricity 24 7 reliably efficiently and with no greenhouse gas emissions
3822254 we were wrong and i think it was a mistake
3822255 the latest designs for proposed plants are smaller cheaper and more efficient than reactors of the past
3822256 coal with carbon sequestration looks more like 20 years away than 15
3822257 e very dollar spent on nuclear power is a dollar stolen from the real solutions to climate change
3822258 they confuse nuclear weapons with nuclear energy claim non existent dangers and misrepresent nuclear powers economics
3822259 the electric research power institute says this kind of solar power is two to four times more expensive than electricity from natural gas or coal
3822260 if this can work here maybe it can work anywhere
3822261 de trend is dat verwachtingen voor economische groei worden getemperd dat werkt door in taxaties voor bedrijfscijfers
3822262 im not here to take chads spot or replace him whatever you had with chad may that continue
3822263 to our great distress there are too many mishaps we are asking the local authorities to maintain their sewage systems every year that they check them and put defensive measures in place
3822264 you can hear the russian jets flying overhead it is very unnerving
3822265 theres no doubt that the stability and calm has created a good atmosphere that has allowed us to make more summer camps and oversee the youths
3822266 w e also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt lesbian gay bisexual transgendered families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
3822267 ill be a president that stands up for american families all of them
3822268 finally i want to congratulate all of you who have shown your love for each other by getting married these last few weeks
3822269 he essentially has bought the homosexual agenda hook line and sinker and has promised to push it whole heartedly to use the full weight of the office of the presidency to push the homosexual activist wish list
3822270 look mom i know that youre supposedly working during the day rehearsing and hanging out with the prom king from little children as if that counts as work i on the other hand am actually doing real work during the day im on the phone with everybody back in the la office listening to pitches attempting to decipher some interns coverage of a script that i know i wont like but i have to read it anyways because i do a good job and im playing phone tagging with shiloh youd think it would be easy to get a hold of her since were in manhattan and shes on french time but i dont think her blackberry gets reception in all way in the boonies and on top of that im trying to find a little place in hancock park so mom maybe tomorrow we could stay in and order some pizza and i dont know just take it easy
3822271 there wasnt really a big promo before they got here if a lot of people knew maybe we could do a welcome parade or something
3822272 and theyve got everything for us here so we dont need to leave campus everythings pretty locked down i think were going to make a late night target run to pick up last minute things you forget like shampoo
3822273 if we really wanted to shut something down wed own the building and have police guarding it
3822274 excuse me i hear you tried to talk to one of my athletes
3822275 youre not allowed to talk to them they are off limits and what is your name

3822296 i have two different modes i have my on set mode and then i have my mode with my friends and family my taylor mode and when im in my taylor mode i forget that people still see me as jenny it takes a minute
3822297 with jenny theres that sense of a very intelligent observant young girl looking around and going you know im not as rich as these girls and i dont have that leg up because of my family but im just as pretty and i think that im smarter so if i play my cards right i can win this game
3822298 we wanted a character that in this journey of trying to fit in at school might actually succeed in her goal and even triumph over the other girls at some point
3822299 jenny has put high school to the side and focuses on her career trying to be a fashion designer and to fulfill her goals of world domination
3822300 they take up most of my body and im not used to coordinating them
3822301 i had the opportunity to say no but i love it ive grown up in it its kind of all i know
3822302 she really had that great quality on the one hand being cindy lou who really sweet and just sort of delightful and smiley and funny and she can act her age but she also has that gus van sant side to her very grown up very self aware there is an intelligent watchful darkness that shes got as well those two qualities flickering back and forth between the sweet and the innocent and the more intelligent observer felt like that was really something that could be something magical for the role

3822309 things have changed over the past 25 years if you take out the trivial ceremonial part of this and ive seen tapes of the puja initiation ceremony its not see this is not being promoted as a religion but as a way to physically and emotionally relax
3822310 this 1 2 minute ceremony of gratitude in india is traditionally done in appreciation for ones teacher
3822311 bottom line one should not confuse something that is cultural with something religious

3822313 aggression against a small country in europe not be passed over in silence or with meaningless statements equating the victims with the victimizers
3822314 there can be little surprise therefore that russia responded to this unprovoked assault on its citizens by launching a military incursion into south ossetia
3822315 despite georgias assertion that it had imposed a unilateral ceasefire russian peacekeepers and supporting troops remained under continued attack a fact confirmed by observers and journalists in the region

3822336 it depends on what the meaning of the word is is
3822337 its important that the american people have the opportunity to have a president like him
3822338 i didnt want it her cancer to take this away not just from me but from those people who depend on our having the kind of president he would be

3822340 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
3822341 but at some level many realize that what is really important is to get good value for their tax money

3822343 in the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time including the bush cheney energy bill which gave close to 3 billion dollars in new giveaways to big oil a terrible policy that john mccain opposed

3822352 the difference between abkhazia and kosovo is that the u s was able to mobilise 40 countries to recognise kosovo but russia cant expect any single country to do it not even belarus or armenia
3822353 abkhazia is weak but a de facto state whereas south ossetia is not self sufficient georgia is not an option anymore so it can exist only as part of the russian federation

3822570 i cant stand it when theyre mealy so i tend to stick to other stone fruits especially nectarines and plums
3822571 to select good peaches check the fruits background color it should be golden never green look also for a distinct orange hue to store peaches that are still too firm leave them at room temperature for a little while refrigerate them only after they have begun to ripen chilling peaches that are far from ripe will turn their flesh dry and mealy to cook with peaches peel them the way you would peel tomatoes score an x on the bottom of the peaches then blanch the fruits quickly in boiling water transfer them immediately to a bowl of ice water then peel away the skin with your fingers if youre cutting peaches in advance add squirts of lemon juice to the slices to keep them from browning

3822582 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3822583 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3822584 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3822591 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3822628 of some concern in all this is the fact that some of our volunteers who collected the food heard for the first time some folks say that they could not give anything because they are barely able to make it themselves
3822629 it was not a large number but it may grow even as the need continues to grow right now our growth curve is sort of up and to the right at what seems like a 45 degree angle its probably not really that steep but it shows no sign of leveling off

3822653 offers an opportunity to put an end to this self destructive cycle of safe legal and rare otherwise known as regret depression and self denigration
3822654 with the release of the new platform and so long as the obama campaign doesnt cast the platform into purgatory and pick an anti abortion candidate like virginia gov tim kaine for vice president the emancipation of women may once again become a legitimate political position it is time to revive the moral argument for protecting a womans right to choose abortion is about the value of womens lives

3822672 i just know from personal experience as a young kid having my first interaction with a professional sports team or a specific player is something i have remembered forever
3822673 and its something i have remembered for my life so that is our main goal we want to make sure we reach out to our younger fans get them involved and let them know they are important to our organization
3822674 the mvp membership for 15 gives you a whole bunch of options and great benefits one of which is that great lunch box you saw and inside the lunch box is a membership card autographed photo of screech stickers and best of all a ticket booklet for buy one get one free tickets for all sunday home games and 10 off at the team store at new nationals park on any sort of merchandise plus all kids in this particular membership program get a special mvp line for kids run the bases sundays after the nationals play their scheduled game this exclusive line goes onto the field first before everyone else so these mvp kids do not have to wait as long
3822675 also these kids receive a special invitation to participate in a special baseball clinic on the field and all their names are included in special drawings throughout the season to be a part of the starting 9 when kids take the field with players for our washington nationals right before a home game begins and another to say play ball before the start of selected games
3822676 we still have a few more on field activities planned and the lunch box itself is something the kids really enjoy as it can be used year round remember you still get the stickers and the autographed photos the special line for kids run the bases so no its not a waste of 15 and i really believe its a small fee for the benefits received in return the lunch box by itself is a great gift a very nice item obviously the ticket discounts still are in effect for the remainder of the sunday home games and kids run the bases will occur for three more home dates
3822677 we are actually quite proud of that 2000 number of jr nats members and its growing all the time
3822678 we definitely make the effort to get our younger fans involved and the nationals believe the great fan experience especially for kids comes from giving them the opportunity to maybe do a meet amp greet have that special fan experience they will remember this is really beneficial for them and helps the nationals build a relationship with younger fans

3822708 much has been made about the poor air quality in china and the effect it is having on our athletes
3822709 but we have a serious home grown pollution problem right here and canadians ranging from the very young to the very old are paying the price
3822710 both of which rise during pollution episodes and in the few days afterwards and explain in significant part the number of acute deaths due to air pollution
3822711 canada gets a fair bit of pollution from the american midwest which drifts north comes across through ontario and continues right on through to quebec
3822712 sometimes people in rural areas think theyre escaping very nicely because they dont live in downtown wherever the fact is these masses of air pollution move across the countryside and some of our worst air pollution occurs in rural areas because it just happens to be downwind
3822713 this report shows for the first time the tragic effects of the toxic air that we breathe whether it is in my hometown of vancouver or across the country in st johns
3822714 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die

3822716 diving is not here to support canada on its own
3822717 the games have just started people are still training for their events theyre still competing and the medals are going to come
3822718 i think any time you put up 10 runs in a game its a good one
3822719 any of the eight guys could be on the podium i have to calm down go relax and get focused
3822720 the first fencer i fought had a very strong technique which better suited my fencing style i prefer attacks which give me more time to react
3822721 the italian sanzo in my second bout was very fast and because of his style i had little time to react he dominated throughout the competition
3822722 so you must be pretty disappointed world ranked before this event and yet something happened
3822723 our first season will be a tough learning curve but we hope to be able to represent korea to the best of the teams abliities

3822782 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
3822783 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3822784 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration

3822800 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it

3822806 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3822807 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3822808 the car was clearly marked they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in humanitarian community in afghanistan
3822809 since they oppose the current government they also oppose those who work with it
3822810 and unfortunately they dont differentiate among armed multinational forces security contractors and humanitarian groups
3822811 the irc provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted

3822835 im changing my name because master p is who i used to be i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood i wouldnt change my past because its groomed me to be the man i am today people grow mentally and spiritually through life experiences but when you come from hip hop its almost impossible to move past the stereotypes associated with it ive branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry therere a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the business man
3822836 its almost impossible to move past the stereotypes associated with it

3822838 my films are misinterpreted all the time i dont mind that everybodys films are misinterpreted but theres no malice or stupidity in the people that misinterpret them
3822839 in israel its like star wars the first star wars not the crap recent ones if there is a cinematic corporal punishment and god knows people want me to have it but lucas himself should get it he should be beheaded for those last three movies i dont care if i piss off george lucas he probably doesnt know who i am

3822842 as the worldwide communications industries grow at unparalleled levels the need by emerging companies to be able to draw upon some of the most experienced executives in the public relations and branding arenas has grown significantly our relationship with barry began in the late 80s when he oversaw communications strategies and efforts for many cutting edge companies he has been a trusted associate in our many endeavors and it is a career dream to work with him in a new business venture as b hi continues to grow and expand its areas of expertise
3822843 dean and lee have been friends and business associates of mine for more than two decades and we have long sought opportunities where we can work side by side
3822844 the creation of bender helper impact evolution is that opportunity and together we will provide an entirely new level of public relations communications and branding to those companies that seek experienced counsel within the scope of their current growth situation i look forward to this new association

3822848 is not even in print at the time it is offered
3822849 the house is burning down and the president of the united states says this is the way to put out the fire applause and to me at this time there is only one answer to this question and that is to give the president what he demands and says is necessary to meet the situation
3822850 such action is necessary to protect the currency system of the united states
3822851 under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe any transactions in foreign exchange export or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency by any person within the united states
3822852 during any other period of national emergency declared by the president
3822853 require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency or in an amount in money of the united states measured thereby
3822854 no man outside of a lunatic asylum will loan his money today on a farm mortgage
3822855 there is no limitation upon the power of congress it is not circumscribed in any respect whatever it is given full and plenary power to deal with that subject and therefore it is the same as if there were no constitution whatever
3822856 with the full understanding that the government may change its monetary policy at any time and that he must accept whatever the congress says at a particular time shall constitute money
3822857 coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures
3822858 the constitutional power of the congress over the monetary system of the country t hese clauses interfere with the exertion of the power granted to the congress
3822859 obligations cannot be legally avoided by prohibiting the creditor from receiving the thing promised there would be no serious difficulty in estimating the value of 25 8 grains of gold in the currency now in circulation
3822860 for the government to say we have violated our contract but have escaped the consequences through our own statute would be monstrous in matters of contractual obligation the government cannot legislate so as to excuse itself
3822861 secreting or manipulating his assets with the intent to place them beyond the reach of creditors
3822862 will bring us unending humiliation the impending legal and moral chaos is appalling
3822863 that by false interpretations and naked usurpations the government has been made in practice a very widely and almost wholly different thing from what the constitution itself purports to authorize
3822864 has either authorized such a government as we have had or has been powerless to prevent it in either case it is unfit to exist
3822865 the extent of dods contracting is particularly evident during prolonged large scale operations like those in iraq where there may not be enough military personnel available to provide logistics support
3822866 providing security for all personnel including contractors is an inescapable aspect of u s operations in iraq because of the instability and violence in that country
3822867 is at least 2 5 times higher than any other major u s conflict
3822868 it is a neck and neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss
3822869 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3822870 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3822871 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3822872 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3822873 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3822874 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3822875 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at any time in the future
3822876 mr lutfi and mr spears britneys father and conservator jamie spears have mutually agreed in private that no hearing or order is necessary at this time
3822877 if mr lutfi makes any future attempt to contact britney after the temporary conservatorship has concluded britney has made clear she will take all appropriate legal action
3822878 one of the reasons that the date was changed was in order to do the extra scenes which they were always going to do if they felt the film warranted it theyve added some new stuff and people are very excited about it
3822879 valkyrie is a great story a true story and its a faithful account
3822880 they havent bent the story to accommodate the movie or anything its an honest and serious film
3822881 the new scenes for the large part are those scenes in north africa
3822882 so where it stands is that theyre very excited and enthusiastic for it and very bullish for it
3822883 so take your date to see a movie about killing hitler
3822884 but is he ready to lead with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to offshore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real obama
3822885 what we decided to do is find the top three international celebrities in the world and i would say from our indications britney and paris came in second and third
3822886 will people think of this as negative advertising look it is the most entertaining thing i have seen on tv in a while it is not our campaign that is trying to make him into an international celebrity its his campaign i dont know paris hilton and britney spears but they are international celebrities so you know apples to apples
3822887 it is beyond dispute that obama has become the biggest celebrity in the world it is a statement of fact that is backed up by his tour
3822888 the question we are posing to the american people is is he ready to lead yet
3822889 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another
3822890 certainly footage of obama alongside spears and hilton is designed to make him seem at the very least egomaniacal and at worst intellectually hollow
3822891 its a little bit of alternative a little bit of pop a little bit of rock
3822892 i basically stepped outside of my comfort zone and i came up with something that i can honestly say is for everyone
3822893 i think that one of the emphases will be that a gentleman is diverse
3822894 i worked with all the normal people that i work with like stargate but is one of the newer cats that ive worked with
3822895 this is perhaps the most important memory i have collected
3822896 in all the years toms been here hes never once had a visitor
3822897 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december
3822898 i am therefore delighted to announce that thanks to the generous support of bloomsbury scholastic and amazon and with the blessing of all the wonderful people who own the other six original books the tales of beedle the bard will now be widely available to all harry potter fans
3822899 notes by professor albus dumbledore which appear by generous permission of the hogwarts headmasters archive
3822900 dumbledores commentary on the tales which was discovered among his papers after his death includes some historical notes personal reminiscences and insights into that most mysterious branch of magic wandlore
3822901 i very much hope that readers coming to these classic wizarding fables for the first time will find his commentary both entertaining and helpful
3822902 to benefit institutionalized children in desperate need of a voice
3822903 its instantly putting you in the position of being a foreigner an outsider and a sexual stereotype its an all in one combo
3822904 asian women get exotified and hyper sexualized to the point where it really affects our day to day life
3822905 a lot of times when people use phrases like that they neglect the background
3822906 like sex trafficking so if a guy goes up to someone in a bar and hes using that phrase and hes imagining that scene for some reason im sure they mean it as a fun thing i dont think they mean it to be malicious they know shes not a prostitute but its attached to that its a lot more than a simple phrase
3822907 and then i was watching full metal jacket and im going ohhhhhh thats where 2 live crew got it ok but back in the day everybody would be saying that
3822908 love you long time comes out of a fairly stereotypical situation and its recycled itself back into the culture
3822909 now its being used as an empowerment phrase like to deny it i wont love you long time or women who take the phrase and use it to assert themselves
3822910 it came from this cool dark powerful place which all women possess i guess i just took that and ran with it because that phrase just came to mind love you long time it just seemed powerful for a woman to possess that much energy all she has to say is four little words and shes got everybody eating out of the palm of her hand
3822911 bitch she started saying shes a bitch im a bitch and she owned the word women should be grateful to her for that shes a modern day feminist
3822912 its just one of those sayings thats kind of pushed its way into our slang and our vocabulary
3822913 its definitely one of the more popular shirts by far
3822914 people when they see it they just laugh like oh my god i get this all the time
3822915 i was walking down the street and this guy yells from his car love you long time me love you long time
3822916 and i was so horrified of course hes talking to me to the asian woman walking down the street and he left
3822917 i dont mind it when its used in songs like when
3822918 i wish we could take credit for the number of deaths
3822919 the writers damian shannon and mark swift after we had done everything said did you notice how many kills there were and we said yeah there are a lot they said actually there are 13 so the writers had figured that out
3822920 we also show what jasons doing when hes not killing
3822921 hes just great on it and people didnt know that its fun to watch
3822922 our character has been rejected hes pulled away from society he wants to live by himself and all of a sudden these kids come into his area and disrespect his area and he has nowhere to go hes like a caged animal with his back against the wall and he albeit in a bad way protects himself
3822923 my knees got pretty damaged i had some bad knee problems afterwards and it took me about four weeks to really recover from it it definitely isnt as campy as the original friday the 13th movies they were what they were for their day but when you look at them now you dont get as creeped out its a different feel i think the audiences are demanding a little bit more of horror movies now so ours is a lot of blood and guts and weapons and stuff like that
3822924 ive been doing the character background the victimization of jason since he was abused as a child he was always the outcast
3822925 he was always shunned by society so ive taken the stance that its almost like a vietnam flashback where someone has been victimized and abused so badly that when things resurface and these kids start to encroach on his area he is once again having a flashback its a moment so intense that hes getting his revenge for when he saw his mother get murdered hes still in the moment like these people just recently murdered his mother and hes having his revenge
3822926 we had to keep the hockey mask which is where it all started and camp crystal lake as a jumping off point for us to go back to the first one
3822927 we wanted to make a movie that was fun and we havent done that before
3822928 a lot of our movies i think have been more dreary and tended more towards what they call torture porn the scares are so scary but the scares are happening to kids that you love because you had a fun experience with them these are kids who are drinking smoking and having sex and its been a long time since youve seen that on the big screen were hoping that those two things coming together will give the audience a new experience with a horror movie
3822929 just make friends with him that way he wont be lonely
3822930 grab a good nerf football a nice game of catch with jason no hes like a wild animal let him be go your own way
3822931 if regulators really wanted to limit speculation in the oil market they should keep the shorter term futures contracts and eliminate the more speculative six month futures contracts
3822932 for model specifications with short term futures contracts supply does indeed dominate price movements in the crude oil market
3822933 when i seen that i was like thats what i wanna do
3822934 he did the first single i remember last year when i was touring crank that would be on the radio every five minutes i was like man this is exactly what this album is gonna do straight takeover i did production on this one i accepted a lot of beats from underground cats on this album i just shoot my e mail out on the hip sites i play off by ear not off whos doing it i like music
3822935 if you notice since britney spears started wearing clothes and behaving paris hilton is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
3822936 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
3822937 i forget the exact terminology but the comment was made in terms of her activities now seem to be that shes calmed down and shes in a relationship thats quieted her down and as such she seems to be attracting less attention and theres less activity that the paparazzi all of you are focusing on
3822938 provided a statement to law enforcement that was useful in the sheriffs office investigation of our case
3822939 thats been so difficult for me to keep under wraps because watchmen is my favorite comic of all time so when zack had asked us to do the song for watchmen the end credit song and the single for the movie we were floored and when he said it was going to be a dylan cover that he wanted that was so amazing
3822940 it has so many amazing lyrics but ive picked my four favorite verses we wanted the song to feel like a product not of its era but of the movies so its recorded and performed in a very early 80s punk style similar to the the ramones thats what it feels like its a dirty punk song
3822941 its really inspired by james carrolls version of people who died
3822942 when i brought that up to zack he said thats in the end credits to snyders remake of
3822943 you dont really find my chemical romance songs in films i believe one was in the end credits to house of wax or something at some point but other projects were never right for us watchmen is right for us
3822944 bob dylan had apparently heard from his assistant that wed covered it hed seen a clip of it on the internet
3822945 weve been doing it live just to warm up and apparently dylan was very happy about it and very psyched
3822946 ive seen the trailer loved it and i keep trying to push zack saying hey were doing the song can we see some footage every time i see zack i ask so i think im going to get to see some of it soon
3822947 i went and got a fake id with a different name and i have a pair of sunglasses and a hat
3822948 the game is incredibly accurate its identical and its so intuitive for me as a player that i have become better at my instrument its gotten me a hotter girlfriend its made me better looking and ive made more money since playing it

3822950 were working stuff out with his management and were talking about splitting the cost of a ping pong table to take out
3822951 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3822952 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3822953 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3822954 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3822955 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3822956 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3822957 this was simply a murderous act against humanitarian workers committed individuals who were there to assist the people of afghanistan
3822958 she was utterly compassionate she was giving she was courageous and she was very very good at her work
3822959 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3822960 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3822961 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3822962 in contact with afghan authorities to confirm reports that two canadian aid workers were killed today
3822963 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3822964 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3822965 get out and vote or the end will be near
3822966 the world is ready for change because obama is here
3822967 any chair unless hes paralyzed yeah i said it cause bush is mentally handicapped
3822968 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
3822969 i heard about his skills when he was doing his thing in chicago i definitely heard some rumors that he was going to run but i just wanted to feel his vibe man hes real down to earth his energy is great hes just an honest dude and hes all about change im all for change im just pro obama i dont think theres anybody better who can be put in that office right now besides that man

3822971 to say that royal society is losing trust of the community it serves is wrong it would be better if people listened dispassionately to the evidence and the science and used it to address the questions
3822972 they do not seem to be based on any solid evidence
3822973 our experience from over 10 years of gm cultivation shows that gm technology has been found to deliver real environmental and economic benefits
3822974 at a time when demand for food and fuel is rising and in the face of growing environmental challenges we need to find ways to feed an ever increasing global population
3822975 even for a prince whos a long established champion of organic farming and critic of gm crops these are comments which verge on the extreme
3822976 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3822977 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3822978 that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3822979 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3822980 safety will always be our top priority on this issue

3822988 i have very strong feelings about this university and about the goals that this department has for the future i can only hope that we will be able to spark the same kind of rice magic at quinnipiac and develop a culture of philanthropy

3822990 lenders discovered that they could make 95 percent and even 100 percent loans by getting other lenders to offer second mortgages for the amounts over 80 percent of property value piggybacks carried higher rates than the first mortgages but in many cases the cost to the borrower was smaller than the cost of mortgage insurance the interest on piggybacks was deductible where mortgage insurance premiums were not in addition borrowers could pay off the seconds in full at any time whereas getting rid of pmi was a hassle of course the pmis did not give up market share willingly they induced congress to make mortgage insurance premiums deductible at least for a period but this had only a small impact

3823021 because of the suspicious nature of the death and the unidentified substance it leads to a lot of questions
3823022 the walls looked like they were moving sometimes there were so many bugs and roaches on the wall
3823023 when the door first opened roaches fell from the ceiling down to the floor so i knew then we were in for something
3823024 there was garbage packed up to the ceiling the smell was so overwhelming the investigator had to where a gas mask
3823025 it was probably the most disgusting scene that ive ever been involved in as far as human waste and filth and the sad thing about it is you had a wife and four kids who were confined to these four walls and were not permitted to go outside
3823026 chicken and chips was pretty much their diet there was evidence of some other things in there like old pizza boxes but from what i understand those were his and the kids and her were not allowed to partake
3823027 from what i understand he just left and didnt come back and she got word somehow i dont know what happened but she got word somehow that he got involved with another lady
3823028 nobody in this community knew that he had children or a wife thats whats so strange about this this family was so afraid of this man that he said they are not to leave and they did not leave
3823029 he was always talking to my son and to my boyfriend just being normal like normal people do

3823053 er wird st ck f r st ck herangef hrt das dauert etwas
3823054 zu sp t so zukunftsf hig sind wir jungen deutschen
3823055 wir sind dabei entscheidungen zu treffen und die notwendigen schritte einzuleiten
3823056 unsere spieler machen mental und k rperlich einen guten eindruck wir werden alles reinlegen um bei den bayern zu bestehen
3823057 in vier jahren in london bin ich wieder dabei versprochen
3823058 ich musste das olympische dorf verlassen zum gl ck war ein r ckflug sofort verf gbar
3823059 ich wurde bei einem angriffsversuch von einem gegenspieler in der luft leicht angegangen geriet dabei aus dem gleichgewicht und kam ungl cklich auf dem linken bein auf dabei ist das knie durchgeschlagen ich merkte gleich dass da etwas kaputt war
3823060 das hat mich damals nicht aus der bahn geworfen und das wird es auch jetzt nicht tun zum gl ck sind die b nder und knochen im knie nicht besch digt in zwei monaten m chte ich wieder auf der platte stehen
3823061 es geht f r sie darum situationen richtig zu beurteilen sie entscheiden nicht nach dem image eines spielers
3823062 m glich dass genossen aus menschlicher not solche aussagen gemacht haben sie sind aber falsch
3823063 ich besch ftige mich viel mit der k rperlichkeit von musik und ihren energien
3823064 hartes ger usch ist ziemlich h sslich aber es gef llt mir
3823065 diese pflanzen stellen ein gro es problem dar und man kann gegen sie nur vorgehen wenn sich die b rger mit engagieren
3823066 die population dort ist sehr stark und es ist schwer dieser plage dort herr zu werden
3823067 spielende kindern verletzen sich oft das liegt auch daran dass sie so harmlos aussieht
3823068 das ist die gef hrlichste zeit denn die pollen k nnen schwere allergische reaktionen ausl sen
3823069 wir lassen eine gewebefolie testen die soll den pflanzen licht und n hrstoffe nehmen wir hoffen es klappt
3823070 we believe weve been a little ahead of the curve in addressing fan behavior issues
3823071 in 2006 we had excellent response to the 381 jerk hotline and to the beefing up of police patrols in our parking lots
3823072 while we have not had major issues inside the stadium unruly behavior has been on an upswing across the league and we are going to do our part to ensure that fans feel safe and have an enjoyable experience
3823073 wir haben uns die wurzelverl ufe der b ume genau angeschaut das ist keine hauruck aktion
3823074 liebe und detail und der londoner ed davenport z rtlichen techno und rauen minimal auf
3823075 mich reizen an dem thema vor allem die parallelen zur gegenwart
3823076 gibt das nicht am ende beifall von der falschen seite
3823077 wenn ich mich nicht voll und ganz einbringe ist es nicht wahrhaftig mein werk
3823078 bei uns gibt es keine langeweile football in der halle ist schnell hart und es gibt immer hohe ergebnisse
3823079 die arena ist perfekt der sponsorenmarkt gegeben zudem haben die fans bei den freezers gezeigt dass sie ein neues hallenteam mit us hintergrund annehmen
3823080 das ist ein spannendes thema football ist in hamburg nicht neu und wir haben noch termine frei
3823081 die teams werden einen etat von 4 5 bis 6 millionen dollar haben
3823082 football in der halle ist schnell hart und ohne langeweile
3823083 das f ngt schon in der schule an es wird nicht gezeigt wie man den stift halten soll und wie das papier
3823084 die noten verbessern sich die kinder werden ruhiger haben keine konzentrationsprobleme mehr
3823085 die ersten hundert tage senatspolitik sind ern chternd die soziale spaltung der stadt wird geleugnet der senat k mmert sich nicht um die skandal sen niedrigl hne die teilweise im hamburg bezahlt werden in der finanzpolitik bahnt sich ein neuer gro er ausverkauf ffentlicher unternehmen an der senat macht schwarze politik mit gr nem lack arbeitnehmern bringt das denkbar wenig der einzige lichtblick ist das engagement des senats zur standortsicherung von hapag lloyd
3823086 es steht zu bef rchten dass wichtige projekte wie etwa die wiedereinf hrung der stadtbahn oder die sogenannten shared space projekte letztlich dem klammen haushalt zum opfer fallen oder am konservativen koalitionspartner scheitern einen fortschritt sehen wir in der art der kommunikation beispielsweise bei der tankerhavarie mitte juli auf der elbe der umgang mit den unfallfolgen war zwar nicht optimal aber wir hatten zu keinem zeitpunkt den eindruck dass etwas verheimlicht werden sollte
3823087 als besonders negativ ist uns die vorgehensweise beim tankerunfall auf der elbe aufgefallen unserer ansicht nach hat die beh rde f r stadtentwicklung und umwelt den unfall heruntergespielt insgesamt halten sich positive und negative aspekte aber die waage erfreut haben wir beispielsweise die neue klimaschutzverordnung zur kenntnis genommen sie liegt f r neubauten ber dem bundesstandard
3823088 der bisherige auftritt des senats ist effektiv und professionell aber es kommt nat rlich auf die konkreten entscheidungen der n chsten zeit an ohne moorburg einen konsequenten hafenausbau die schnelle realisierung der hafenquerspange daf r aber m glicherweise mit steuererh hungen werden investoren weiter einen bogen um die stadt machen das kraftwerk moorburg wird zum lackmustest f r den senat
3823089 es ist bisher richtig ordentlich gelaufen der senat hat ein auge f r die industrie und f r alle betriebe die f r hamburg wichtig sind
3823090 we obviously dont have a lot of pop in the lineup
3823091 it doesnt mean we cant win ballgames yesterday guys were sitting around saying we might not win another ballgame all year i was like forget that im winning five more i dont care what the lineup looks like to me im thinking about every fifth day i dont care if a little league team is playing behind me im still going to throw and try to win every night
3823092 they werent going to give him 100 million he said he was looking for 120 million theyre not willing to go out on a limb that far
3823093 its difficult but i also think were all used to the game itself
3823094 thats part of it its not very often during the course of a year you see two big names like that from one team get traded
3823095 we dont have a whole bunch of veterans among the everyday lineup guys most of the veterans left here are pitchers
3823096 youre always hoping this is it you never know if youve been in this game long enough you know you cant worry about something thats out of your control its easier said than done of course
3823097 obviously were starting to make moves that are telling us that they pretty much think the season is over
3823098 i figure theyre looking for the future and definitely looking for some guys that they can sign in the offseason i would expect them to go out and spend some money well see
3823099 es gab schon welche die meinten ich sei die bedienung an bord
3823100 da ist man den ganzen tag drau en an der luft und kann sehen wie die passagiere auf das reagieren was man ihnen erz hlt
3823101 ich bin bei ihm auf einem schlepper mitgefahren da war mir klar dass ich das auch m chte
3823102 wir haben uns damals sehr ber eine bewerberin gefreut bis 2011 werden wir noch weitere hafenschifferinnen ausbilden
3823103 schwarz gr n hat auf dem feld der bek mpfung rechtsextremistischer straftaten eindeutig nachholbedarf wir werden als spd bei den anstehenden haushaltsberatungen darauf achten dass bei polizei und staatsschutz die zust ndigen stellen entsprechend ausgestattet werden
3823104 h tte ich dort gestanden w re ich jetzt tot
3823105 ich empfinde keine angst sondern rger ber so viel dummheit das sind leute die von der thematik keine ahnung haben
3823106 wir haben erst durch die medien von den anschl gen erfahren
3823107 es ist ungeheuerlich dass mitarbeiter die ihre dienstliche pflicht erf llen opfer rein ideologischer angriffe werden
3823108 es ist derby und osnabr ck wird voll dagegenhalten um bei uns einen punkt zu holen
3823109 mo ist ein gerechtigkeitsfanatiker wenn er meint dass er nicht gut behandelt wird zeigt er das auch
3823110 wir fordern ja von unseren spielern rger und emotionen aber sie m ssen wissen dass es grund tzlich nichts bringt zu meckern kein schiedsrichter der welt nimmt eine entscheidung zur ck man muss sich gleich auf die neue situation konzentrieren
3823111 damit hat er uns einen b rendienst erwiesen mit elf mann h tten wir sicher gewonnen
3823112 wir werden in der pagode unter anderem seminare zum thema buddhismus abhalten jugendgruppen treffen sich hier und es gibt vietnamesisch unterricht f r kinder

3823118 federal communications commission fcc regulations prohibit telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers automated dialers are standard in the industry so most telemarketers are barred from calling consumers on their cell phones without their consent the national associations representing telemarketers have stated that their clients do not intend to start calling consumers cell phones

3823172 cuando las democracias no le sirven al imperio el imperio gesta golpes de estado
3823173 la oposici n deber a entender el mensaje del pueblo pero no lo har n no les interesa
3823174 las clases medias no valoran los 200 bolivianos alrededor de 30 d lares mensuales de la renta dignidad a los ancianos pero para un campesino equivale a cuatro corderos por mes
3823175 hoy ya hay campesinos que pastorean sus ovejas hablando con celular
3823176 luego del discurso del presidente se abren nuevas posibilidades para ir construyendo un estado fuerte s lido y duradero para el futuro
3823177 todos debemos sentarnos a discutir una constituci n que contenga las visiones esperanzas expectativas y formas de vida de todos los bolivianos que sea la base para este gobierno y los futuros gobiernos
3823178 si tienen un mensaje radical que depongan su actitud y trabajemos juntos
3823179 estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos nacionalizaci n de las empresas
3823180 si me ratifican con m s de un 54 voy a convocar a todas las autoridades para buscar consensos y que el pueblo pueda aprobar una constituci n pol tica del estado boliviano que es un tema pendiente
3823181 el triunfo de la revoluci n democr tica de bolivia y del pueblo boliviano est dedicado a todos los pueblos revolucionarios de latinoam rica y el mundo
3823182 por primera vez en esta historia del pueblo boliviano hubo un referendo revocatorio y cont con la participaci n masiva de todo nuestro pueblo
3823183 no solo elige a sus candidatos adem s de eso los ratifica o los revoca
3823184 estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos nacionalizaci n de las empresas fundamental en la retoma de las empresas del estado
3823185 este mandato del pueblo boliviano ser respetado y aplicado en los distintos niveles sectores y regiones del pa s para que bolivia cambie tenga igualdad y dignidad
3823186 la participaci n que hoy se vio es para unir a los distintos sectores campo y ciudad y esa unidad se har juntando la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado con los estatutos auton micos respetando las normas existentes
3823187 pese a la alianza de la derecha fascista racista y algunos medios de comunicaci n
3823188 m s del 90 por ciento de los medios est n contra el proceso de cambio por lo tanto contra el pueblo esos periodistas est n contra m s del 65 por ciento de bolivianas y bolivianos que le dicen s al cambio
3823189 porque eso es autonom a democracia participativa real y es una forma de llevar el poder de decisi n a la gente
3823190 estamos impulsando la creaci n de la agencia tributaria departamental para contar con una entidad que defienda nuestros recursos de forma eficiente y transparente que permitir la ejecuci n de un fondo solidario de apoyo a otros departamentos
3823191 lo confiscado por el neopopulismo masista debe ser recuperado y eso no se negocia
3823192 la democracia ha sido fortalecida el presidente evo morales ha revalidado con creces el apoyo popular y esto significa un respaldo directo y definitivo de las pol ticas de distribuci n de la riqueza e independencia econ mica llevadas adelante con absoluta convicci n y firmeza por su gobierno
3823193 bolivia ha demostrado al mundo entero que los elementos de contralor propios del sistema democr tico no s lo son suficientes sino tambi n efectivos
3823194 am rica est dando una muestra cabal de solidez institucional fortalecimiento republicano y respeto irrestricto a las instituciones
3823195 profunda convicci n en la b squeda de consensos como la nica v a para el logro de una sociedad m s justa
3823196 constituye un paso relevante hacia la superaci n de la situaci n
3823197 contribuye a la pacificaci n de la sociedad boliviana y a la preservaci n de la integridad territorial
3823198 esta consulta electoral ha constituido un brillante ejemplo del comportamiento c vico de la ciudadan a en la b squeda del fortalecimiento de sus instituciones democr ticas y la consolidaci n del estado de derecho
3823199 felicita al pueblo hermano por su firme voluntad de avanzar en la construcci n de una sociedad con mayor democracia pluralidad y creciente justicia social
3823200 la extraordinaria vocaci n de los bolivianos para someter importanes decisiones pol ticas a la voluntad popular
3823201 la ratificaci n de evo morales en el referendo revocatorio representa para los pueblos ind genas la esperanza dignidad y resistencia de nuestros pueblos ante el saqueo y robo insaciable de las empresas transnacionales y los estados unidos
3823202 da clara muestra a los sectores oligarcas tradicionales represores y pa ses intervencionistas que los pueblos originarios e ind genas de abya yala ya no estamos dispuestos a seguir permitiendo que se nos siga machacando nuestra dignidad y territorios
3823203 como pueblo maya unimos nuestra fuerza dignidad y lucha por la defensa de la madre tierra frente a las nuevas agresiones del neoliberalismo encabezado por los estados unidos en alianza con las oligarqu as y burgues as nacionales que han venido saqueando las riquezas de nuestros pueblos
3823204 alan garc a hern n fuentes y alcaldes deben someterse a refer ndum como lo hizo evo morales en bolivia
3823205 con los pa ses vecinos como per seguir n las relaciones normales cada pa s ha asumido en el marco de su soberan a los convenios que le convengan respetamos los convenios que tienen pero tambi n exigimos que respeten nuestra posici n
3823206 y con per compartimos procesos de integraci n como la comunidad andina de naciones mientras que con el resto de pa ses compartimos otro proceso de integraci n como la uni n de naciones suramericanas
3823207 no tenemos tlc y eso no es reciente como bolivia no queremos tlc con estados unidos ni europa pero otra cosa es la can
3823208 el gobierno de morales no est en desacuerdo con las autonom as es m s pensamos que las autonom as es una reivindicaci n hist rica y se van a dar las autonom as es petici n mayoritaria del pueblo boliviano pero esas autonom as deben estar enmarcadas en la constituci n pol tica del estado
3823209 bolivia ahora es confiable y sujeto de cr dito por eso estamos decididos a implementar en esta etapa de cambio un programa de nacionalizaci n
3823210 bolivia garantiza la inversi n extranjera y otorga seguridad jur dica pero estamos decididos a poner orden si no acatan las empresas
3823211 que bien que civilizado es viene de los pueblos originarios pero entiende la modernizaci n del estado
3823212 los resultados le dan un arma de mucho valor al partido de gobierno para poder negociar y buscar un camino de coincidencias ya que si persiste las divisiones no habr n ganadores todos van a perder y bolivia podr a caer en ese v rtigo de violencia que se ve desde hace mucho tiempo
3823213 estamos dispuestos al di logo y abrir la autopista auton mica pero siempre que se respete la autonom a ind gena a la par del resto de las autonom as
3823214 eso es inviable aqu nosotros siempre quisimos el di logo pero no tenemos confianza en el gobierno porque nunca ha cumplido
3823215 no hemos decidido nada al respecto a n y no est en los planes del ejecutivo adoptar una medida en ese sentido
3823216 en abrir el di logo es sincero y quienes siempre se negaron o rompieron la negociaci n fueron los prefectos
3823217 no importa con cu nto gane el gobierno o los prefectos opositores igual deben buscar acuerdos
3823218 puede haber algunos temas que dividen pero hay m s temas que los unen nadie podr a oponerse a conseguir una sociedad m s equitativa en la que todos los ni os puedan ir a la escuela o acceso a la salud y que todos los bolivianos m s temprano que tarde tengan una vida digna
3823219 luego de quitarles sus pertenencias como tel fonos celulares y otras les tomaron fotos los amenazaron y les dijeron que no los mataban porque hab a sol para luego soltarlos
3823220 vamos a blindar al gobierno de evo morales que se ha consolidado tras el refer ndum
3823221 nos planteamos la nacionalizaci n de la lucha contra el narcotr fico
3823222 en el futuro va a seguir habiendo cooperaci n pero el gobierno boliviano va a decidir en qu se gasta y qu se hace con esa plata
3823223 celebramos la idea de que las autoridades bolivianas estar n dispuestas y ser n capaces de destinar fondos de bolivia para tambi n atacar este problema
3823224 nuestras cifras indican que aproximadamente un 88 por ciento de nuestro financiamiento va directamente a asistir a las autoridades bolivianas y a trabajar en enfrentar problemas antinarc ticos
3823225 la pol tica del gobierno norteamericano hace que de toda esa plata que deber a de ir a mejorar las condiciones de vida de los cocaleros de esas zonas el 85 por ciento vaya a movilidades sueldos viven en hoteles con piscinas vi ticos va a sus bolsillos
3823226 no rechazamos la ayuda de estados unidos pero la plata no est llegando a los cocaleros quienes est n dispuestos a producir otros productos y dejar atr s la hoja de coca
3823227 la cooperaci n estadounidense tiene su propio manejo administrativo t cnico aut nomo con respecto a la ayuda que hacen queremos revertir esta situaci n
3823228 existen 14 alcaloides en la hoja de coca s lo uno de ellos es coca na si sacamos la coca na fuera de la coca entonces puede ser exportada ese es el plan
3823229 nosotros nos opusimos ac en per al matrimonio religioso a finales de noviembre del a o pasado formulamos oposici n a la arquidi cesis de santa cruz de la sierra que a n no ha sido resuelta
3823230 si uno utiliza las instituciones religiosas para obtener efectos puramente circunstanciales es decir por el miedo a un exhorto que el juez peruano ha enviado a bolivia para que la curatela sea efectiva en ese pa s stas no tienen validez
3823231 entiendo el dolor la amargura y la rabia del se or francisco tudela una familia separada una familia que l siente que la han desgarrado en este caso puntual ha sido utilizado lo que sucedi ayer fue una versi n mejorada del vladispot

3823233 aqu falta alguien que s hizo un acto preparatorio de la visita y no est incluido lo cual confirma que fue un acto pol tico manejado por el gobierno
3823234 quiero en este d a reafirmar mi compromiso con todos los bolivianos residentes en nuestra ciudad para seguir estrechando los lazos entre ambos pueblos sepan quienes han escogido a calama como lugar de residencia que en el futuro pr ximo haremos todos los esfuerzos para que este sea un buen lugar para vivir y que el hecho de estar fuera de su patria sea una oportunidad de aprendizaje y progreso

3823244 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3823245 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3823246 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3823247 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3823248 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3823249 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3823250 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3823251 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win

3823267 all we have asked is that shareholders be given their rightful opportunity to cast their vote based on the facts at hand
3823268 we are gratified that the court has come to the same opinion
3823269 after evaluating all the information made available to them the stockholders will then decide to stay the course with the companys current management or else elect a new slate of directors in either case it is up to the stockholders to vote their prerogative and i find no good cause shown to further delay their ability to do so

3823275 patents matter in crowded niches like nac we know of other companies that use arp management to do nac mirages win at the patent office could give it a leg up with competitors its less clear how broadly the new patent claims will be interpreted or whether mirage plans to enforce them with companies it thinks are infringing

3823408 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3823409 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
3823410 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3823411 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3823412 these contributed to a heightened sense of risk and strengthened the genuine suspicion that the persons identified were in fact a threat to the tank and its crew
3823413 the tank crews superiors asked to authorize firing by the tank reasonably concluded that the characters identified by the tank were hostile and posed a threat to the tank and its crew
3823414 the mere suspicion of possible hostilities should not be enough to justify overwhelming deadly force
3823415 we hope that the armys conclusion does not appear to give soldiers free license to fire without being sure of the target greatly hindering the medias ability to cover the conflict

3823441 economics by john mccain support george bush 95 percent of the time keep spending ten billion dollars a month for the war in iraq while the iraqis sell oil for record prices giving iraq a 79 billion oil surplus and hurting our economy barack obamas plan end the war responsibly better schools no more tax breaks for oil companies barack obama the middle class first
3823442 in the senate barack obama has voted in lockstep with president george w bush nearly half the time including the bush cheney energy bill which gave close to 3 billion dollars in new giveaways to big oil a terrible policy that john mccain opposed the truth is barack obamas plan is a job killing machine that ignores the struggling economy and raises taxes on family savings social security and small businesses

3823457 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from but from diablo i we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in

3823505 as an opportunity to consult with our counterparts about the implications of the russian action in georgia
3823506 the proposal was discussed by ambassadors this morning and there were no objections
3823507 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3823508 we have credible reports of villages being burned shootings and killings
3823509 russian tanks are going through villages inhabited by the georgian population and throwing people out of the houses pushing people into concentration camps that they are setting up in those villages and separating men and women
3823510 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3823511 taking advantage of this lull we are reburying those killed in the georgian aggression

3823519 we are committed to a solution that recognizes that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008 a solution that ensures tangible deliverables are put on the table of zimbabweans a solution must thus put the people first not leadership positions and titles
3823520 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
3823521 the distance that president mbeki and the zimbabwe negotiators have traveled in these talks is quite long and if it is only one sticking issue no matter how critical or strategic it will be overcome
3823522 all parties have invested a lot in these negotiations the talks cant collapse on this last leg both mugabe and tsvangirai are condemned to a political settlement they are sizing each other up as it were but there is little doubt the two will find a compromise
3823523 the strategy seemed to be spray and pray lets go speed speed speed

3823600 what are you doing miss ashley are you not going to ride on hellia
3823601 i think its time that i ride on someones weapon because trent kun rode on hellia for a few times its only fair that since you are his older brother you help him pay his debt and reaper is bigger then coatl so it is easier for me to get on him
3823602 she has a point master why is it that females only use their brain extensivly when they want to get their way with us males
3823603 shes already on you so fly already hellia you might want to attach to miss ashleys back
3823604 like i can tell the difference from west and east you think you can control the flight controls better be my guest
3823605 okay if this was like a horse or cow i would control it with my heels
3823606 that is just what i would expect from you thinking of me as a horse or a cow im not some livestock
3823607 well i think i have the basics of your controls
3823608 yeah im okay just having some fun hellia sorry about the abrupt kick i only did that so you two would be safe even if i couldnt get reapers flying controls down you can guess what would happen if i couldnt
3823609 or reaper would save me and i would owe him but neither happened now lets go find trent and artemis
3823610 you there on the is that a sword what do you make of it smith
3823611 are you talking about that thing they are on or that thing on the other guys back
3823612 i was wrong hiuk that wasnt another guy it was a woman but it was hard to tell from down here short hair big axe small breasts and clothes that would fit a teenage boy anyone in this town would be confused
3823613 that doesnt matter smith they were flying just like those two idiots that came to town yesterday both of them claiming they were looking for two more living weapons that could or couldnt be in this town
3823614 those two idiots you are talking about there names are trent and artemis correct
3823615 well im friends with artemis and trent is my little brother handcuffs snap on bens wrists he raises them and looks at them what are these i never saw anything like them but they look weak
3823616 if you want to hold on to reaper be my guest and try to carry him
3823617 i will introduce myself i am ben akamaru my village akamaru village was destroyed by the magos my brother trent akamaru and comrade artemis akamaru are searching for a way to defeat them i believe you might have seen their weapons coatl and blunt
3823618 you are under arrest for flying in the town and assulting an officer of the law
3823619 i didnt assult you sir i merely handed reaper to you and you were just too weak to even move it
3823620 well i guess since you are new and were able to make a monkey out of officer hiuk ill let you off with a warning and if you come with us to the police station i can help you get your brother and comrade out of jail
3823621 students will return to class this fall with little or no idea about what it means to be a free active and engaged citizen in a democracy
3823622 students have become canaries in the free speech coal mine we can predict the future health of freedom of speech in america by looking at how public schools live up to or fail to live up to the first amendment
3823623 a nation that does not educate in liberty will not long preserve it and will not even know when it is lost
3823624 not all school officials make the false choice between security and freedom
3823625 not a run of the mill low point in the economic cycle
3823626 while i have full confidence that new zealand will start growing again later this year no one should expect that once growth returns the world will keep ticking along as it has for the past two decades
3823627 we note he gave undertakings to the forum last year which were clearly not implemented and forum leaders do need to hold him to account for that
3823628 were looking at structural changes including closing or rationalising sites and reducing the number of shifts in factories
3823629 the last 40m was really really tough you spend the last 10 into the wall feeling like youve got lead arms
3823630 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3823631 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3823632 sometimes people regard pregnancy as a time when you would expect protective and nurturing responses if someone was violent before you got pregnant they are likely to continue that while you are pregnant
3823633 the horrible reality is that pregnancy is one of those times when women are more at risk and family relationships are more at risk
3823634 there is this sort of myth that being pregnant protects you and actually this is showing us that its not
3823635 rcmp conducted a routine vehicle stop on sunday and found a beaten and distraught 18 year old female driver

3823643 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3823644 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3823645 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3823646 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3823647 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3823648 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
3823649 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3823650 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all

3823652 die schere zwischen arm und reich klafft immer weiter auseinander
3823653 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
3823654 coming to cleveland was something i felt was a good fit for me as a player i knew some of the guys and this was a team headed in the right direction
3823655 let me tell you what a difference it is going to be to have shaun rogers and corey williams on that line with me and shaun smith last season was tough we played a lot and things didnt go our way
3823656 with these guys here you have to account for everybody just look we are big guys all of us that can make plays i dont believe we are going to be in the same position we were last year
3823657 mel tucker is a good coach knowing from when he was the defensive backs coach we know what kind of coach he is what kind of man he is and what his expectations are
3823658 anytime you get a new coach there is going to be change with mel he is a players coach he will listen to what we have to say with that you have to respect him as a man and he respects us the same
3823659 weve worked hard in this camp mel tucker has pushed us and hes been around long enough to know how much we can take weve been working and we have had some fun in camp
3823660 dont throw away the old bucket until you know whether the new one holds water

3823662 were making some headway in getting that land from the federal government bernard said

3823667 hell never tell you that he cant play but by saying that its kind of sore and its throbbing all night you kind of get the feeling that its pretty rough
3823668 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3823669 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3823670 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3823671 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3823672 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3823673 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3823674 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well
3823675 weve had a few false starts and ive had to run a couple of laps no big deal
3823676 no one wants to see that you want it to run like it should and i think for the most part weve done that now they havent thrown everything at me but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok

3823678 buy it or dont fucking buy it im not mithered either way
3823679 you know some hyped up things are total let down when you actually get them like you save up for ages to go to an expensive restaurant and the waiters are too snooty and the table is too small and the pudding tastes like mr whippy
3823680 i doubt very seriously if ill be giving a speech in prime time
3823681 despite the best efforts of health professionals the little girl died
3823682 a police inquiry reporting to hm coroner is now under way
3823683 i think sports have to keep up with technology its a great suit for me putting the suit on mentally its time to go fast
3823684 i found out the day after my singles match id lost four and a half kilos since i arrived here
3823685 i didnt prepare as well as i should have done it was unprofessional and something i need to learn from
3823686 ill have to make sure it doesnt happen again because i think im playing really well right now the us open is my favourite tournament and i believe i can do really well there
3823687 ideally id have like to have got here earlier but i didnt because i played very well in cincinnati
3823688 normally at each tournament i weigh myself right at the start and i should have checked that as soon as i got here instead of the day after my match
3823689 we didnt serve particularly well or return well and it was always going to be difficult if you cant put any pressure on them
3823690 after being a part of the olympics for the first time and seeing what it means when the athletes win medals and how big a deal it is you realise how much you want to do well and sometimes you want it a bit too much and dont play so well
3823691 the police department will use both diplomacy with the ring leaders and saturation of the affected area to bring resolve to this matter
3823692 diplomacy with the ring leaders will entail the issuance of a cease and desist order saturation will include additional manpower overtime extra hours long shifts and the issuance of tickets saturation also involves serving warrants and subpoenas
3823693 the curfew shall be applied to minors at all times are required by the city code adults will be observed on a case by case basis and dealt with in accord with established state and federal law
3823694 the department has not made any arrest to date for curfew violations all violators which have been processed were for other breaks with the law however we are proceeding with zero tolerance on crimes and traffic in the relevant zones
3823695 the evidence is going to show that she left when her brother didnt come back with food and that somebody did commit homicide on her and it had nothing to do with david onstott

3823701 i just tried to black out the whole thing it was bad
3823702 for the first time we were able to show that neuregulin 1 which has been genetically implicated in schizophrenia affects a brain activity that appears to be altered in schizophrenia
3823703 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
3823704 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease
3823705 i believed she has been tortured based on my experience with people with post traumatic stress disorder
3823706 numerous documents describing the creation of explosives chemical weapons and other weapons involving biological material and radiological agents
3823707 the tests are to find out what is going on medically and get her some human rights
3823708 weve looked at this the federal partners have been bery good in sharing information
3823709 there is no credible threat to the united states or assets in new york from this individual
3823710 its not surprising it might wind up on a list somewhere thats the same thing i would say of the hoover dam
3823711 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3823712 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3823713 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3823714 europe has to get engaged physically on the ground and europe has to stop that from happening
3823715 the european union cannot be indifferent to this war these massacres on our doorstep
3823716 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3823717 it just doesnt seem to me to be very smart in such a time of crisis to decide whether we should revert to the previous situation
3823718 only option to prevent similar acts of aggression and occupation of georgia in the future is to give it the nato membership action plan
3823719 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods
3823720 europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3823721 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3823722 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3823723 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3823724 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok

3823734 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3823735 i do not see any obtainable objectives in lebanon and the longer we stay there the harder it will be to leave
3823736 if you get involved in a major ground war in the saudi desert i think support will erode significantly
3823737 nor should it be supported we cannot even contemplate in my view trading american blood for iraqi blood
3823738 we have many more hungry people to feed today than even just a few months ago
3823739 including at least 14 million people in the horn of africa where drought and insecurity coupled with high food prices is putting lives at risk
3823740 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3823741 promptly and thoroughly investigated and if proven strict and exemplary action would be taken
3823742 in a whole range of african countries where there are factional fightings there are paramilitaries operating all over and serious violations of human rights by everybody the u n peacekeepers have also been tempted and fallen prey to this utterly unacceptable standard of behavior
3823743 i certainly can speak for the indian army with my just under 40 years in uniform
3823744 when you have such large numbers deployed in such circumstances not that im condoning it but theyre really aberrations one must take note of it and make sure that theyre severely dealt with
3823745 the special committee is confident in the companys strong financial and clinical momentum and its uniquely productive r amp d capabilities which will continue to enhance shareholder value
3823746 we look forward to the company maintaining its successful relationship with roche regardless of ownership structure
3823747 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3823748 we have said that the sanctions should not be lifted without the return of all abductees and our stance will never change
3823749 ill never trust north korea at all i cannot be confident without seeing results
3823750 look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time make the right moves on the nuclear issue
3823751 this is an achievement thanks to fukudas talks oriented policies
3823752 we have to monitor details of their action and consider if it will lead to what people can accept
3823753 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3823754 bill is a non conformist hes a maverick hes a very provocative teacher
3823755 what seems to be the provacateur for all of this
3823756 is the idea that debaters are allowed to strike two judges and in this case there were 5 judges and the fort hays state university team struck two judges who had given them low scores in the past one of them happened to be a black female and that set the thing off
3823757 and were sure that theres probably some facts and information thats just not available
3823758 i mean you see a lot on the video but we need to make sure everything is revealed before we take any action
3823759 i wish everyone would recognize the importance of these issues and stop to think about the consequences theyre having on real people
3823760 the remaining residents of these destroyed ethnic georgian villages are facing desperate conditions with no means of survival no help no protection and nowhere to go
3823761 this 11th hour ruling from the is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3823762 as president will fight to maintain the strong protections of the
3823763 in this case it was determined that we need to move forward in a timely fashion
3823764 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events
3823765 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3823766 the han and the ethnic minorities including the uighurs are equal members of the big family in china and they are all chinese citizens who enjoy the rights and freedoms allowed them by law
3823767 we have no plans to insert money into either of those two institutions
3823768 given that fannie mae and freddie mac are solely involved in housing thats their sole business and given the magnitude of the housing correction weve had its not a surprise to me to see those losses
3823769 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor here in treasury
3823770 i believe its going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all the housing problems
3823771 the period of turmoil that were going through in our capital markets today is different from some of the periods weve had in the past in that the root cause took place right in the united states of america
3823772 long term economic fundamentals of the united states compare very favourably
3823773 guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3823774 bound to be the case that theres a quarter or two of negative growth
3823775 aqu est lo que necesitas saber para comenzar tu propio negocio y ser tu propio jefe
3823776 diabetes is becoming a huge concern among hispanics obesity heart disease all of these chronic diseases that plague most of the rest america are now becoming major issues for hispanics even to the point where their rates are becoming higher than the average population
3823777 and what weve learned from our data is half of the people that we talked to did not have insurance most did not have a regular health care provider but when they found health care they generally felt they were treated fairly
3823778 even people who work in the industry in hotels they work specific hours in one hotel and they dont give them enough hours to be able to receive benefits so they work two part time jobs and they dont have insurance in any of them

3823795 het probleem met de tong had zich ook in rotterdam al voorgedaan jammer want verder had ik van het begin een goed gevoel maar een topklassering wordt nu heel moeilijk
3823796 hoewel ik maar n echte fout maakte had ik niet het goede gevoel dat ik normaal heb ik bleef net onder de 70 punten en dat is te weinig voor mij maar op de n of andere manier dacht ik dat nadine zich niet helemaal gaf het dier had ook wat last van de hitte al is dat volgens mij op de uitslag niet van betekenis geweest

3823802 as nfl guys we dont get star struck much but when you get a tiger woods come in who is the best at what he does its unbelievable if you can pick his brain a little bit which i know ronde did and some of the linebackers did it was awesome he was giving some messages last night the one thing that caught everybodys attention was about never having a mental breakdown you can have a physical breakdown but hell never have a mental breakdown that caught everybodys attention he says he has a certain amount of hours to prepare and that if he has a mental breakdown its his fault because he wasnt prepared physical breakdowns happen everybodys human but mental breakdowns should never happen if you study thats why ronde barber and derrick brooks and those guys are great players
3823803 i was walking around talking about it this morning you dont understand tiger woods was in our meeting room last night it was amazing there are only a couple of athletes in my generation that i would like to meet but hes one of them he is one of the most dominant athletes of my era and probably ever it was surreal it was crazy you look at him and you are just wowed it was a tremendous honor to meet tiger woods
3823804 for me the two global names in my lifetime certainly are muhammad ali and tiger woods for him to walk in the running back room and see all of running backs scramble to get their camera phones and take pictures with him for guys warrick dunn earnest graham michael bennett and b j askew those type of people to want to get their picture taken with him was really something i dont watch golf much i dont know a lot about it but i do watch the golf channel late at night after he does his rounds and the questions they ask him i told him that his articulation about every hole and the practice work he put in on every round it almost brings it to life to hear him talk about it when i didnt see him play he came back at me and said that it was just like coaching and remembering plays he was just exciting to be around he really fit right in with us it was certainly a pleasure and an honor to meet a guy like that tiger woods is tiger woods you know what i mean
3823805 im just a journeyman according to some people why should i have any hard feelings im thankful to have this job i might pay bruce and jon for bringing me out here
3823806 thats what this sport is it has two sides obviously a game for all of those who play on the field and love to play the game but there is a business side too part of teams trying to reach that championship position is trying to strengthen their team whether they thought that was strengthening or not as much as i believe that i can be a strong point for this team that is what they had to look into so be it its all said and done were moving forward
3823807 i always tell people you want to play three safeties at all times
3823808 if you can do that and limit some of the reps off of
3823809 theyre still battling it out and we keep it hot in our room we keep the controversy going so you guys will be buzzing
3823810 it was a matter of leg angle which is no big deal
3823811 its just that the first time it happened it happened in a game thats what makes it tough
3823812 you never really know about a guy until the pads go on so that was good to see
3823813 anytime you can get to the quarterback we like that
3823814 if youre the head coach and youre top receiver hasnt practiced yet yes youre concerned but were also looking at it optimistically because we proved the other night that we have some young guys who are capable of playing and were thrilled with that

3823821 clearly whoever dreamed up that bit of tripe doesnt really know the first thing about money and economics yet the msm kept repeating it verbatum no msm outlet has ever properly explained why if cheap credit no longer existed lol did interest rates drop
3823822 or maybe it isnt fishy and its just that the bbc jouno who wrote that statement didnt seem to think this relevent
3823823 as various service providers have been given licences in different areas at different periods of time the authority feels that keeping the subscriber base as the criteria for deciding the priority of allotment shall be against the level playing field and the principle of equity

3823825 lisa is so knowledgeable i just learned more in this one and a half hour workshop than i learned in four different workshops that i took elsewhere
3823826 ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract and i will play out my days at chelsea
3823827 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3823828 it has taken a while to get it done and there has been a bit of compromise on both sides
3823829 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3823830 the club gave me time and i appreciate that i feel for sure i have made 100 per cent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3823831 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3823832 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3823833 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3823834 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with every day he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game all the time
3823835 there is no evidence that the senator had any knowledge of these actions or condoned them

3823855 this new tactic is likely to be more successful than recent single line spam campaigns because it looks like a legitimate e mail news update
3823856 they are trying to do something to regain their power
3823857 of course we all know that spam exists but we certainly dont like it to invoke the brand name that is so meaningful to us and our readers
3823858 we send out hundreds of thousands of legitimate email newsletters requested by our consumers every week the key is not falling for the trickery of spammers and being able to discern what is real and what is fake

3823861 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3823862 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3823863 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3823864 probably the best candidate we could have on our side
3823865 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3823866 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3823867 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3823868 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3823869 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3823870 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3823871 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3823872 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3823873 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3823875 you should be aware of your rights so as to ensure that you secure your full entitlements as well as being aware of the obligations of your chief officer and police authority under those regulations and determinations
3823876 our members together with chief officers and police authorities are expected to comply with their obligations under the police regulations and determinations
3823877 this is particularly so when police officers are dissatisfied with the way we are being treated by the government
3823878 we are extremely disappointed and understand the deep sense of anger and frustration you must feel finding yourself in this position again wondering what the pay settlement will be and when you will receive it
3823879 all too often we hear the platitudes of the prime minister and other government ministers describing what a difficult job we do how brave we are and how much we are valued
3823880 we have made it clear to the home secretary that actions speak louder than words
3823881 clearly this government still fails to recognise that police officers are not employees but independent officers of the crown with restrictions on both our private and professional lives
3823882 the government has again failed to respect this fundamental difference between police officers and other workers when it comes to determining our pay we will continue to fight for appropriate recognition
3823883 this is what happens when the government refuses to honour pay negotiations for a workforce that cannot strike
3823884 ministers have not only shattered police morale but their crass decision is now compromising public safety
3823885 this is the first government that has failed to honour a police arbitration tribunal decision its breach of faith is foolish short sighted and dangerous
3823886 this has come about because of the completely dishonourable way the government treated the police during last years pay negotiations
3823887 public safety and national security are key priorities for us and should always be put first we know that the police share our determination to do this
3823888 after the 2010 2011 the hold harmless doesnt apply does it
3823889 it hold harmless really only does that for one year doesnt it
3823890 only in that first year is the hold harmless in effect
3823891 hows the voer supposed to know by ballot title and summary
3823892 you take a quarter from over here and you go and take it from a quarter over here to replace it
3823893 do you know any other definition of equivalent other than equal
3823894 you can increase revenues and you can increase expenditures but you cant increase the mill levy
3823895 if you keep the mill levy the same and cut road and bridge but your revenues next year are higher than what were projecting you can project that money into road and bridge
3823896 someone is going to have to pay for maintenance we put on the back burner
3823897 well maybe a better scenario is if you just kept road and bridge the way it is and if your revenue is higher than you think which i think its very probable that will be then wed have the ability to project that onto road and bridge
3823898 you wont see the increase in revenues in the road and bridge fund but you may see those in the general fund and we could transfer that over
3823899 aircraft has still been going pretty well and we havent hit another one of those layoff periods but were generally behind the rest of the country
3823900 when they the rest of the country come out of it the recession well be going into it because thats just the way that aircraft cycles a little bit different from everyone else i dont know what the next two years holds for aircraft but thats what our growth on the west side is based on
3823901 if youre counting on better revenues here i wouldnt be counting on a whole lot of it from them
3823902 youre talking a 150 million and if we cant keep it level
3823903 what are we going to do in the future then were going to have to go up 10 mills next year if something crazy happens
3823904 whats killing us this year is our energy costs and our petroleum costs
3823905 we can point to almost 2 million in this budget thats directly reflective of petroleum costs
3823906 when i do this i start cutting without looking at the mill levy impact
3823907 i typically try to be around four to five percent in the budget and this is the number it came out at 36 294 in the past weve came at 36 we came a little higher but weve always tried to stay about 35 9 thats kind of been our benchmark
3823908 whats really occurring over the last few years is that youre seeing the taxes levy with the value going up but your expenditures arent rising at the same rate
3823909 this year were saddled with the fact that we dont have a lot of other revenue growth as well as far as small assessed growth its the worst of both worlds essentially
3823910 we know fuel costs are up we know liquid asphalt is going to kill us and to me it just doesnt make sense to pass that off and hope that things will get better and do less projects in 2009 and then have to double our effort in 2010 and 2011 because we didnt do what we should have done in 2009
3823911 id like to see it the mill levy stay 35 9 too but i dont see it making sense sooner or later were going to have to breach that
3823912 were trying to create a healthier environment for employees and i think that would help
3823913 where people can make a choice on health decisions is where i draw the line
3823914 i think now is a good time to go to the one day work week for us
3823915 you have justification for that due to the increased workload youve taken on
3823916 when you are trying to tighten the budget up it doesnt make sense to add on more stuff
3823917 on our high school project the contractors have completed all the pier work and theyre now working on grade beams
3823918 theyre primarily working on the auditorium area they are working on that area so they can start setting steel
3823919 weather was a factor in the progress so we did some work inside the building
3823920 they did complete a temporary walkway thats to get the food service up to the level
3823921 they wanted to get all the concrete work done but theyre going to regroup and do something temporary
3823922 we also purchased a 40 second clock for the stadium
3823923 weve done some work in the press box we still have some additional work to do in there
3823924 weve got to get some gravel bases built and talk to the contractor hopefully it will quit raining so we can get those done by the end of the week
3823925 we are working on a contract with the little league football and at skelly the curtains are up
3823926 well try to keep the activity down in that area
3823927 i want to thank you all for being here taking time out from your busy school preparation schedules
3823928 as a former teacher i am a strong supporter of education
3823929 i never worked so hard in my life as i did when i was a teacher
3823930 you dont find many schools that are able to meet the ayp targets for reading and math in 2007 2008
3823931 i know how difficult it is to achieve the criteria
3823932 i want to commend all the students and the teachers and the support staff and the administrators of usd 490 for their hard work
3823933 you done a great job to help answer the evolving educational needs of this community
3823934 id certainly like to be on the other end of it
3823935 the game is dictated by your starting pitcher and the ability or the inability to put zeros on the board after you score
3823936 i think hes in a position now where his due is coming
3823937 it was a good win because it was a total team effort we battled from the start it something that we havent done in a long time
3823938 weve been losing too many games in the seventh inning and later
3823939 were getting him checked out were very suspicious hes not right
3823940 hes not right i know that for a fact i dont know if hes hurt but hes not right
3823941 weve got to try and be patient with him and hope he learns something every time he goes out there
3823942 the main thing to me is how we play wednesday
3823943 the last two series we face kansas city we do the same thing we win the first game and all of a sudden we lose the series i hope these guys remember that the way i do
3823944 i didnt care if i gave up 100 runs that game i was so beat out there i was so exhausted out there
3823945 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3823946 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3823947 i threw the ball a lot better than the linescore said
3823948 if they didnt quit tuesday i dont think theyre ever going to quit
3823949 that was the important thing thats really what were attempting to do is win series and go from there
3823950 to win three out of four against their pitching staff is pretty good
3823951 theyve got an outstanding staff and getting three is big
3823952 i also know im capable of pitching badly and it can change in a heartbeat
3823953 obviously juan vlad and ga driving the ball out of the park was big from the offensive side
3823954 after you go through them two or three times theres a chance theyre going to get you
3823955 youre going to be up and down you just have to stay humble and try to help the team in any way you can
3823956 starter kyle lohse made one mistake and our offense got shut down
3823957 i dont sit there in my office and dream hes going to go 7 0 or 6 0 whatever hes just been almost unhittable or unscorable since hes been here
3823958 the starters success will let you play a long time
3823959 keep playing well now and then get an opportunity to play into the late fall
3823960 the last few weeks this ballclub has really been playing hard
3823961 and then the addition of manny has certainly picked up the personality of this club we feel this is an important week for us
3823962 it seems like its been a long time since ive been out there
3823963 it was good to be able to throw strikes again
3823964 i think a combination of not getting some wins over there in oakland and then coming over here in a trade and trying to justify the trade i think he put too much pressure on himself
3823965 and i think finally he just kicked back and relaxed a bit
3823966 i know what happened with dunns trade but we need to continue to play hard and dont think about anything hopefully this win will wake everybody up we can start a nice winning streak and get confidence
3823967 it paralyzed him for a little bit but hes walking around pretty good now thats good news thats the only good news we got tonight
3823968 i liked going to my grandmas house and my cousins house
3823969 we have a proven track record of operating within our means
3823970 on that note i would entertain a motion to approve
3823971 there were three buis at el dorado that i am aware of
3823972 we expected dunn to solidify the middle of the order and take some pressure off the other guys
3823973 he did that and solidified the four hole in the lineup
3823974 im having a tough time right now but ill battle through it just like anybody else
3823975 im just going to grind out and keep trying to make my pitches you cant really stress about it and try harder because it will just get worse

3823986 in order to prevent an escalation in xdr tb we need to ensure adherence to the cornerstones of tb management which include directly observed therapy isolation of infectious cases and contact investigations we also need to institute routine rapid and standardized methods to assess drug susceptibility of tb isolates

3823993 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me
3823994 his friends would tell me that he liked me and that he thought i was pretty
3823995 you never knew because it changed from day to day
3823996 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and we had sex sometimes we would go to his house or we would fool around in his truck just driving around and then parking
3823997 one morning he called and asked me to meet him in town
3823998 i said youre supposed to be on a flight right now and casey said im not going he called jamie lynn and told her that she would have to go by herself she was irate i think she knew he was staying because of me
3823999 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally

3824022 all i know is there is a problem joel is not himself i can see it in his face i can see it in his demeanor
3824023 right now i dont feel comfortable pitching joel im not talking about because of results im talking about because something is not right
3824024 its going to be next year until he gets back to 100
3824025 were just a competitive football team thats good were not going to get into specifics thats how competitors are its been a long camp todays really the last day and were just ready to start seeing other people on a weekly basis
3824026 guys are just passionate about their job kits taking care of his players and guys are ready to hit somebody else
3824027 he probably would have got knocked out so i would have rather he just stayed back and be the quarterback
3824028 the apollo moon shot and the human genome project rallied support for massive r amp d efforts that created the capabilities to overcome obstacles that were not contemplated at the outset of these initiatives
3824029 similarly todays barriers to improving biofuels are significant but genetics and genomics can catalyze progress towards delivering in the not too distant future economically viable and more socially acceptable biofuels based on lignocellulose
3824030 over the past 10 000 years wild plant species were selected for their desirable traits resulting in todays highly productive food crops we simply dont have thousands of years in the face of the energy and climate challenges so by applying the power of genomics to these problems we are seeking to speed up the domestication of energy crops and the technologies for converting them to suitable biofuels as a more carbon neutral approach to meeting part of our transportation needs
3824031 with the data that we are generating from plant genomes we can home in on relevant agronomic traits such as rapid growth drought resistance and pest tolerance as well as those that define the basic building blocks of the plants cell wall cellulose hemicellulose and lignin biofuels researchers are able to take this information and design strategies to optimize the plants themselves as biofuels feedstocks altering for example branching habit stem thickness and cell wall chemistry resulting in plants that are less rigid and more easily broken down
3824032 using this prospecting technique we can survey the vast microbial biodiversity to gain a better picture of the metabolic potential of genes and how they can be enlisted for the enzymatic deconstruction of biomass and subsequent conversion to high energy value fuels
3824033 given the daunting magnitude of fossil fuel used for transportation we will likely have to draw from several different sources to make an appreciable impact with cellulosic biofuels all of which will in some significant way will be informed by genomics
3824034 toward this end rapid new sequencing methods and the large scale genomics previously applied to sequencing the human genome are being exploited by bioenergy researchers to design next generation biofuels higher chain alcohols and alkanes with higher energy content than petroleum and more adaptable to existing infrastructure
3824035 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3824036 girl did you even wear this i know how it is i have a closet full of impulse buys that i thought were really cute when i bought them too
3824037 relationship youre the hook up girl i know three guys that have hooked up with you youre not the relationship kind look ill come by well get something to eat and then go back to your place what else do you want
3824038 whos gonna pay for it wheres the money coming from the debates go on for months well whos gonna pay for it and wheres the money coming from
3824039 we continue to be very pleased with the reaction from customers we see in the market
3824040 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
3824041 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
3824042 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
3824043 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
3824044 our impression is and the feedback we got from our members is that the opposition is very significant
3824045 the feedback especially from the small to medium businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support
3824046 im looking for a handout because im really a useless piece of white trash who has no marketable skills and i ran up my cell phone bill talking to the guy i screwed last weekend and i thought was going to marry me and rescue from my own misery as it turns out he was screwing a lot of other women and really didnt give a crap about me so i might be able to clean your house for the 400 phone bill but youll need to babysit my 2 brats while i do it
3824047 misrepresent or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin
3824048 aladdins commitment to supporting all major development environments and operating systems is clearly displayed in the newest version of hasp srm
3824049 java applications are frequently used in mobile phones smart card devices and embedded software development for medical machinery parking pay stations web cameras and games the widespread use of java poses an increased risk to these segments making intellectual property protection an absolute necessity wherever java applications are included
3824050 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection
3824051 with disintegrating family support networks sudden changes in a persons cultural environment homelessness and poverty were more apt to see risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with sex workers other men or sharing injection needles among male migrants
3824052 however an alternate explanation could be that deportation from the united states leads to social upheaval loss of social ties and income factors which lead to engaging in high risk behaviors
3824053 i have the simplest tastes i am always satisfied with the best
3824054 would it be wrong to ask people to pray for rain
3824055 abundant rain torrential ran urban and small stream advisory rain

3824071 i woke up at about four this morning and was halfway tempted to leave but i didnt know where the hell i was
3824072 im not used to just going home with complete strangers
3824073 what i said im a slut how can you possibly take offense
3824074 i was just kidding around its just my roomates cat
3824075 for ten minutes you watch its a god damn ritual or something
3824076 i only do this when i have guests or a hangover
3824077 ive only been having to put up with it lately because nicks gone he usually gets up before i do
3824078 nothing i swear it just started doing it one morning and now it always does it
3824079 probably because you fed it and now it thinks it has to do that to get fed
3824080 no even when you give him food he wont stop
3824081 really as soon as he hears that someones awake he starts and then about ten minutes later he stops
3824082 i wish i knew i would fix it i swear i would
3824083 no no my treat stay in bed and sleep some more ill just be ten minutes
3824084 the number looks disturbingly bullish but well probably see some rebound in gasoline supplies next week now that refineries are back online after the storm
3824085 weve got a good sized really going here today but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3824086 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3824087 support george bush 95 percent of the time keep spending 10 billion a month for the war in iraq while the iraqis sell oil for record prices giving iraq a 79 billion oil surplus and hurting our economy
3824088 barack obamas plan end the war responsibly better schools no more tax breaks for oil companies
3824089 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3824090 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3824091 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3824092 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3824093 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3824094 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3824095 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3824096 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3824097 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3824098 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3824099 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3824100 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3824101 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3824103 it is likely darius will not be available for something like 10 weeks he will be in a brace for six weeks and then will need another month to build up his fitness apc management tools
3824104 it would be highly inappropriate to do so in the current circumstances
3824105 this is the real tony im well groomed i smell well and thats who i am im a ladies man and the ladies love the smell
3824106 the bottle is blue and its got a slash of gray like my hair
3824107 i got a bottle from them about fifteen times it took about a year one day they sent something to my home and bada bing that did it magic it has a touch of cognac which i love
3824108 edgar k browning professor of economics at texas a amp m university has a new book aptly titled stealing from each other its subtitle how the welfare state robs americans of money and spirit goes to the heart of what the book is about the rise of equalitarian ideology has driven americans to steal from one another browning explains that certain kinds of equality have been a cherished value in america equality under the law and within reason equality of opportunity is consistent with a free society equality of results is an anathema to a free society and within it lie the seeds of tyranny browning reminds us of the biblical admonition thou shalt not steal government income redistribution programs produce the same result as theft in fact thats what a thief does he redistributes income the difference between government and thievery is mostly a matter of legality brownings solution is captured in the title of his last chapter just say no where he proposes the federal government shall not adopt any policies that transfer income resources from some americans to other americans he agrees with james madison the father of our constitution who said i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
3824109 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
3824110 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
3824111 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
3824112 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated

3824115 memcon is about the memory market in general dram sram although its focusing more and more on the flash memory segment like our summit the other difference is that memcon is more about products that presenting companies are selling more than the technologies the issues etc i tend to think that at the flash memory summit we go more in depth through out tutorials panles etc finally the flash memory summit is an industry event and not just denali s the company organising memcon view of the market

3824147 if an independent software vendor discovers that they have shipped a vulnerable activex control they should e mail us to work with microsoft to issue a kill bit disabling that control
3824148 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
3824149 they said many times that they are working as a coalition to better secure the windows operating system and everything which runs on it
3824150 while microsoft has issued a few kill bits in the past for third party products this is something we are going to continue to see going forward
3824151 theyre great for their intended uses but theyre not for everyone
3824152 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3824153 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3824154 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3824155 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3824156 because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3824157 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3824158 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3824159 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else

3824174 she challenged me in a manner halfway between serious questioning and lighthearted flirting as in do you think the likes of you can handle a big role like that

3824222 i had a meeting with all the players the other day and the contents will remain private
3824223 but basically we needed to make the group aware that i am in charge and will make decisions that will affect players

3824228 my part of the club has not changed to any great extent we are interested in good players at the right price
3824229 ok i have reached the point i am satisfied with and can stop pursuing this

3824238 what matters is not what you start but what we finish
3824239 weve come to this level for the pure love and joy of the sport
3824240 anything above that is a bonus but i think its excellent for the next generation of athletes that we would have this kind of incentive program
3824241 it just seemed that this was a mark that was sustainable
3824242 its not one where we would throw these great numbers out there and then all of a sudden get to the next games and not be able to reward them
3824243 what we first and foremost said is that wed like it to be equal a medal should be a medal
3824244 our number one priority was to make sure we rewarded every individual medal the same way whether it came from an individual or a team
3824245 we want to retain those particular athletes as long as we can
3824246 not only to hopefully win more medals but more importantly to have younger athletes learn from them
3824247 we need to help those who are breaking onto the scene
3824248 i think that money should maybe be allocated somewhere else until we have a bigger pot
3824249 in a lot of cases its several years out that theyre looking at identifying those athletes and making sure theyre being brought through that whole cycle
3824250 i think its an important step just in terms of culture in canada to say that we are going to value medals beyond just a pat on the back
3824251 i think that until we sort of say that we can be winners and we expect to be winners which is what offering those incentives does i think that were not going to be the number one nation in 2010 or beyond
3824252 its maybe not the numbers that people would like it to be
3824253 but i think its a step in the right direction
3824254 wwe is now a publicly traded company it is responsible to its shareholders and therefore must react to market conditions and influences much differently than when it was a privately held company while the chairman can stack the deck with a board of directors and executive management team that looks more like a friends and family reunion than anything else should the irs determine that wwes contracted talent are employees and not independent contractors there is the potential for significant fines expenses and cost of doing business on a go forward basis that could have a serious negative impact on wwe stock
3824255 on one hand every talent that performed with wwe knew exactly what they were getting into when they signed on its not as if there was some master plan that was designed to take advantage of them my guess is that they are in a desperate financial situation and found some equally desperate lawyer to take a run at this issue in the hopes of collecting a payday
3824256 but on the other vince mcmahons mandate for absolute control of everything from finishes the words that he puts in the mouths of his announcers and performers to dress codes for talent flying to and from an event may come back to haunt him
3824257 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3824258 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3824259 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3824260 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3824261 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3824262 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3824263 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3824264 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3824265 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3824266 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3824267 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this

3824344 my mom and i wondered into this restaurant on a whim
3824345 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
3824346 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
3824347 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
3824348 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
3824349 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
3824350 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
3824351 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes

3824356 this is a book that captures the great events and people of our day it starts with tonys beginnings which are fascinatingly drawn and rapidly moves to his political career which is the passion that has animated his life for many years
3824357 they will find that his assessment of them both for good and bad is measured and when you look at the score card at the end of the day his detractors will be irritated by how often he got it right when you stack up zimbabwe hiv the independence of the judiciary and the arms deal you will soon see that on many of the issues that have so engaged us over the last 15 years tony was there animating much of the political debate of the opposition
3824358 it is a measured voice that speaks of a degree of political maturity and judgment there is no politician who can engage the difficult terrain of this countrys politics without making many mistakes tony is frank in his appraisal of the difficult decisions and of the errors made along the way
3824359 among the controversial issues including the alliance with the new national party and the disastrous marriage that came of that all are matters dealt with robustly and frankly people will be interested to read how this collaboration unravelled but i rather doubt it will be the favoured coffee table book in the martinus van schalkwyk household
3824360 contrary to what his detractors have thought about him tony is not an insider to political life he is a man who has fought his way into politics climbing the ladder not as a princeling or an heir apparent but through his extraordinary talents and ambitions in the political process
3824361 tony began extremely modestly by taking a ward in bellville johannesburg and worked his way through municipal politics to parliamentary politics and then on to leadership of the opposition
3824362 weighty as this book is what emerges is a person of extraordinary political talent
3824363 so many who write about their lives apart from the things that they hide and this is not a book about evasions have a very humdrum style at best they cobble together short sentences without adjectives and thats when theyre writing well this is a very different book tony writes with an assured voice and an amazing ability to tell the story get to the point and move on there are no long lingering self congratulatory episodes typical of autobiographies
3824364 im delighted to say that apart from his gift of friendship and eloquence im one of his very few pro deo clients go figure the rest that brilliance does not come cheap
3824365 if all else fails you can use this book to fell an intruder
3824366 in light of that i offer this as my contribution to the das crime fighting campaign it will be cheaper than buying a gun
3824367 the real title of this book should have been all too human because typically politicians dont really reveal themselves or examine themselves my reading of political biographies south african and international is that somehow they never made a single mistake they were never wrong and they had an all knowing eye for that which was correct miraculously when they write their biographies they suddenly distance themselves from events they were party to or from which they benefited ive tried not to do that
3824368 history is written backward but lived forward those that know the end of the story cannot possibly know what it was like at the time
3824369 when i met the aggrieved son of president chaim hertzog of israel who mentioned that his fathers book was called living history first i promised him that i would not steal it a second time
3824370 as david has so elegantly alluded to the weight of this book one could argue that like a dieter theres a thin book struggling to get out of the fat one i have tried to tell the personal history the political story and to deal with some of the real live issues were dealing with currently from the erosion of parliament to the assault on the judiciary to the abrogation of the rule of law then as now and to whats caused corruption especially the corruption of the ideals which helped found our country in its new form in 1994
3824371 that to me is the golden thread what ever your beliefs or impulses sometimes you have to go against the grain unfortunately mr yeltsins title was also not available

3824427 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
3824428 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this

3824436 and we knew that this was not a democrat movie
3824437 we were afraid that he would not want to be involved in something that was so directly taking on the left and that he would not want to play the michael moore character

3824444 the accepted way to speak about america is in the voice that disrespects it and the voice thats unacceptable is the one that loves america

3824446 no one on the left wants to admit that radical islamists want to kill americans the jews everyone in the west
3824447 i try to talk to my friends on the left and they just dont get it most of them have never even heard of how can you have an intellectual discussion about the war were in without knowing who sayyid qutb is

3824453 obama is not qualified to be president and itll be a disaster
3824454 i dont think that obama is an evil guy i just think hes wrong but i do think we face real evil in ahmadinejad and the mullahs and all these crazy guys
3824455 john kerry was and obama is fortunately kerry was a stiff but obama isnt a stiff and hes really adaptable hes like a really clever virus who adapts obamas the farthest left of all of these guys and thats why he associated with all of those crazies terrorists preachers of hate
3824456 when i look at the other side when i look at barack obama i see expediency
3824457 hes like family i could never disown him i didnt know him i didnt hear those words in that church
3824458 its a movie its a satire and its a funny satire i dont want to point to this thing just because there are so few films from conservative sources and make it a target its a movie lets not burden this little horse with additional weights

3824472 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3824473 we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3824474 the presidents of georgia and russia agreed early wednesday morning on a framework that could end the war that flared up here five days ago after russia reasserted its traditional dominance of the region
3824475 whether the agreement holds or not russia has achieved its goals effectively creating a new reality on the ground humiliating the georgian military and increasing the pressure on a longtime antagonist mr saakashvili
3824476 terms that some described as humiliating to his small proud nation

3824478 thompson and mccarthy were certainly ok with favre playing another year
3824479 but theres no question that they didnt beg him to come back thats because of what they witnessed late last season
3824480 his performances against the cowboys in texas and in the bitter cold against chicago and the giants raised a big red flag
3824481 the way things are in the nfc the packers will almost certainly have to win at dallas and or in nasty wintry weather in order to get to the super bowl and i just dont think thompson and mccarthy liked their chances with favre at quarterback
3824482 they didnt see favre getting them to tampa in early february so whats the point
3824483 winning 10 or 11 games and then getting knocked out in the first or second round of the playoffs would accomplish very little thompson and mccarthy only care about winning a championship and in their minds the sooner they get rodgers on to the field the sooner that goal can become a reality

3824511 following conversations between the human rights campaign and senior mars representatives the company has agreed to pull its most recent ad using stereotypes of gay men to sell its snickers product line
3824512 these kinds of acts perpetuate the notion that the gay lesbian bisexual and transgender community is a group of second class citizens and that violence against glbt people is not only acceptable but humorous
3824513 following that hrc began a constructive dialogue with mars on workplace inclusion for glbt employees

3824518 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases
3824519 these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
3824520 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
3824521 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease
3824522 our findings support a role for nmdar dependent modulation of da neurons in cue induced relapse to drug seeking

3824541 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3824542 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations

3824561 tapi dalam masalah bahan bakar kita mempunyai potensi tinggi terutama bahan bakar alternatif baik baru maupun terbarukan yang sesuai dengan kebutuhan kecenderungan perkembangan motor bakar
3824562 dalam penggunaan bahan bakar alternatif bahan bakar nabati berhasil menarik perhatian rasa ingin tahu dan menggairahkan dibanding yang lain
3824563 jadi kendaraan dan infrastruktur distribusi bahan bakar dapat menggunakan yang telah ada
3824564 di lain pihak bahan bakar gas baik liquefied petroleum gas lpg dan compressed natural ga s cng sudah hadir bersamaan dengan bahan bakar tradisional lainnya
3824565 jadi dengan harga yang rendah dan insentif pajak bahan bakar gas merupakan alternatif yang tersedia untuk jangka pendek di masa depan tapi ini memerlukan infrastruktur tambahan
3824566 konsumen diprediksi tak bersedia membayar lebih untuk teknologi ini selain itu sistem hibrida penuh masih mempunyai kelemahan dalam penyimpanan energi
3824567 jadi ini akan mengurangi biaya perubahan dari satu konsep teknologi ke konsep teknologi lain seperti halnya motor bakar torak ke hibrida
3824568 masih dibutuhkan beberapa tahun untuk dapat diterima sepenuhnya oleh konsumen bukan hanya soal harga tapi fungsi juga harus atraktif selain itu juga membutuhkan infrastruktur dan kendaraan yang mempunyai ketahanan baik dan akhirnya masalah biaya dari umur kendaraan
3824569 sama halnya dengan hibrida yang merupakan jembatan teknologi menuju sel bahan bakar
3824570 masalahnya peran indonesia pada teknologi industri otomotif hanya sebagai pengguna dan tidak memiliki potensi mengaplikasi teknologi tinggi
3824571 ini merupakan sumber energi nabati yang dapat diubah menjadi bahan bakar nabati

3824575 heartbreak enterprises is the new force in fip and we need the world heavyweight title to prove it i think stevens will make it past castagnoli and hero this weekend but then what will be left of him on august 23rd when i have to return to that hick loser town known as crystal river nothing will be left of him and hell be easy pickings for shiozaki

3824610 this consultation takes forward gowers review recommendation 36 which recommended matching penalties for online and physical copyright infringement by increasing sanctions for online infringements
3824611 several submissions have called for a change in the law to increase online infringement penalties to the levels of physical infringement
3824612 the intention and impact of physical and online infringement are the same crimes committed in the online and physical world should not be subject to different sentences increasing the penalties for online infringement will therefore make the law more coherent
3824613 our investigations concluded that introducing exceptional summary maxima fines would allow magistrates courts to deal effectively with copyright offences as they would be able to award fines that took account of the illegal profits made from such offences

3824667 the moscow authorities will use this opportunity to remind ukraine of the damages of allying itself with nato
3824668 quanto mais aprendo quanto mais realizo mais compreendo que n o conhe o nada
3824669 estou come ando a pensar que essas placas s o meras lendas
3824670 n o s sei como tenha uma dessas estranhas placas aqui mesmo em meu quintal
3824671 n o levei isso muito a s rio no primeiro momento mas como suas fisionomias continuavam s rias decidi ir ao quintal e acabar com aquela brincadeira
3824672 me lembro daquele dia claramente 21 de julho de 1999 embaixo da varanda da casa do vladimir estava uma das placas que tanto procurava a placa era t o pesada que tr s pessoas juntos n o puderam mov la fui ent o cidade de ufa pedir ajuda
3824673 primeira vista disse chuvyrov compreend amos que aquilo n o era um simples peda o de pedra mas sim um mapa real
3824674 identificamos a altitude de ufa sendo o canyon de ufa o ponto chave de nossas provas porque conduzimos estudos geol gicos e encontramos o seu rastro onde ele estaria de acordo com o mapa antigo o deslocamento do canyon aconteceu por causa das placas tect nicas que moveram se do leste
3824675 vejam este ponto aqui o canyon de ufa a fratura da crosta terrestre estendida de cidade de ufa at a cidade de sterlitimak no momento o rio urshak corre pelo antigo canyon
3824676 a latitude e a longitude que coincidem precisamente com a da cidade de ufa
3824677 que o relevo n o foi feito manualmente por um escultor de pedra antigo
3824678 n o temos a m nima id ia somente suposi es o que sabemos que esse mapa est al m da percep o da humanidade atual precisamos de um longo tempo para se acostumar com isso n s nos acomodamos ao nosso milagre primeiro n s achamos que a pedra tinha 3 000 anos s que a idade foi aumentando gradualmente at que n s identificamos as conchas cravadas na pedra quem desenhou esse mapa provavelmente usou essa padra com as conchas j encrustradas nela

3824680 you know having sex with you is like having sex with a corpse
3824681 he sbano suggested he would apply the cream to his penis and apply it inside her
3824682 when the insertions took place and depending on the instructions of his friend he would thrust slowly or quickly for anything from one to ten minutes
3824683 it began to dawn on her that he had devised this treatment in order to have sex with her on his terms
3824684 putting cream on his penis and either slowly or fastly thrusting it in and out
3824685 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3824686 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008
3824687 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3824688 without further delay we are demanding that ngos be allowed to resume humanitarian assistance distributing food medicines and life saving assistance this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
3824689 interestingly krzyzewski said the americans game plan going in will not include much use of a traditional 2 3 zone unless the man to man defense proves ineffective
3824690 if i tell my guys were going to play a certain amount of zone its almost like saying our man to man is not good defense just psychologically krzyzewski said wednesday in discussing his tactical scheme with espn com
3824691 its almost like our man to man defense is not good enough
3824692 if youre constantly adjusting to who you play you never know who you are
3824693 the financial services authority has today fined the uk operations of credit suisse for breaching fsa principles 2 and 3 by failing to conduct their business with due skill care and diligence and failing to organise and control their business effectively
3824694 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
3824695 the sudden and unexpected announcement of the write down had the potential to undermine market confidence
3824696 i doubt very seriously if ill be giving a speech in prime time
3824697 its really devastating from what it was when we first came in here
3824698 the fire department told us to leave and lucky we did boy oh boy it was something else
3824699 its really not good mentally because its not building up again
3824700 my wife and i were trying to get out ourselves live with my daughter in arizona
3824701 in that class since there are so many different tables available download
3824702 everything considered cdi was the best contractor for this project
3824703 we just had to weigh all the information and make the best choice
3824704 some definite built in advantages that offer the owner more options throughout the construction process
3824705 this is a great location for us to converge our resources
3824706 the timing on this one is good in that were finishing up a lot of work
3824707 we want to give you the most aggressive schedule we can
3824708 all this talk about softening my image just really cracks me up
3824709 will president obama do something similar to a stimulus process
3824710 yes barack is talking about doing something for short term stimulation
3824711 but ive decided to stay away from getting baracks policies wrong because itll be on the front page
3824712 when were all together in chicago we like to play games like charades
3824713 we also love a busy house which means potluck dinners with our close friends and family as often as we can
3824714 some of michelles closest friends are white and her sister in law maya is white
3824715 she says reporters always get these shocks when they call up her white friends
3824716 the black middle class is the most invisible unknown group in the country
3824717 there are millions and millions of people in it and yet we know nothing about them
3824718 this camelot myth has formed around barack and michelle but they come from almost the opposite place in the world from the kennedys
3824719 if you saw barack on a yacht that would be pretty unseemly hes the guy from the basketball court who used to go around in jeans and a leather jacket in law school he was really uncomfortable with the markers of elitism like even dressing in a suit
3824720 whenever obama enters the room theres a sense of calm and satisfaction
3824721 thats a mask shes wearing in public most of the time and we arent sure what is underneath
3824722 the first time in my adult life im really proud of my country
3824723 love my favorite colors blue and youd look fine in it
3824724 see barack is the son of an african immigrant which i like since i adopted me a country years back but hes a harvard grad with a white mom and white grandma
3824725 i dont tolerate the use of that or any other disrespectful or denigrating term
3824726 parents you gotta turn off the television set and put away the video games
3824727 and go to your parent teacher meetings and help your kids with their homework
3824728 and if your kid gets in trouble at school dont blame it on the teacher but at the same time teachers got to behave
3824729 theres a lot of people out there who want obama to be all pro black
3824730 but were living in the united states and this country is mainly white you have to conform you really do i think hes fine the way he is he got both sides of the culture like tiger woods none of us can denounce one or the other we have to have both thats just the society we live in
3824731 barack loves coming back to hawaii because it is a gentle place a place he can be himself
3824732 he had friends from all different backgrounds when he was growing up and a lot of them were local theyd cruise around in their beat up beach buggies going bodysurfing barack didnt surf his sense of balance wasnt all that great
3824733 his mom screwed the darkest nigger she could find in 1969
3824734 every black man was thurgood marshall or sidney poitier every black woman fannie lou hamer or lena horne
3824735 to be black was to be the beneficiary of a great inheritance a special destiny glorious burdens that only we were strong enough to bear
3824736 barrys biggest struggles then were missing his parents his biggest struggles were his feelings of abandonment the idea that his biggest struggle was race is bull
3824737 when we got back to the car she started crying she couldnt be black she said she would if she could but she couldnt she could only be herself
3824738 even though my father depended on the assistance of a cane and eventually a motorized cart even though he was in pain he was never late and never complained
3824739 he did it every single day so he could send me and my brother to some of the best schools in the country his priority was to provide for his family and give his children the tools to succeed in life and he did
3824740 i sometimes feel like a visitor on campus as if i dont really belong
3824741 regardless of the circumstances under which i interact with whites at princeton it often seems as if to them i will always be a black first and a student second
3824742 she didnt tell michelle why she was leaving she just left
3824743 what i cant believe is that princeton actually agreed to move the girls room and they gave her a single
3824744 i could work in the black community as an organizer or a lawyer and still live in a high rise downtown
3824745 or the other way around i could work in a blue chip law firm but live in the south side and buy a big house drive a nice car make my donations to the naacp
3824746 everyone was raving about this smart attractive young first year associate they had recruited from harvard
3824747 the fact that as a successful black male barack did not choose a lighter skinned woman as most of them do sends a message to me
3824748 michelle is highly sophisticated yet she comes from the most humble background possible no one can say she grew up in marthas vineyard and shes not really black
3824749 ill tell you my personal philosophy about people if i want to know who you are i look at who you sleep with and who you give your name when i look at michelle barack doesnt have to be any blacker for me
3824750 i think that specific scene represented the characters frustration with the lack of opportunity and feelings of powerlessness that he saw within his own community
3824751 and thats what is so wonderful about the excitement surrounding baracks candidacy his campaign is really about bringing people together to realize their own power in more productive ways
3824752 its such a crock that obama keeps saying hes going to be the first black president
3824753 hes half white first of all plus 44 percent muslim and only 6 percent african
3824754 i think weve changed our attitudes toward african americans in my generation in the south
3824755 but the fact is that if im going to elect someone to the highest office in the land his past needs to be clear
3824756 the spirit of this campaign is about bringing people together and focusing on the things that are similar about us as opposed to the things that make it different
3824757 barack is one of the best political communicators in our history if youre somehow saying that he cant be the same person with all people thats certainly not the case
3824758 i met michelle once and her spirit was so beautiful
3824759 i gave her a big hug and told her that barack has an anointing on him by god
3824760 one day i was going door to door handing out my obama stuff and i came across a house that was flying a confederate flag i thought to myself i dont know if i want to go to this house ive never been to a house with a flag like that before when i knocked on the door i saw that the person there was living in abject poverty now i cant believe that the conservative leaders are gravitating toward a flag when their people are hurting
3824761 the fact is that it is time for racism to die
3824762 but racism is a goat people are lambs and when a lamb is facing demise it will lay down and accept it a goat keeps on squealing bucking and crying at the slaughter
3824763 offered a lifeline to many homeowners facing foreclosure which should help keep more people in their homes and fewer distressed properties from coming on the market

3824772 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media

3824774 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews

3824787 the president is being warned that some issues are a red line that shouldnt be crossed
3824788 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
3824789 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3824790 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3824791 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3824849 in questo modo spiega bart von poll possiamo verificare se gli spotters conoscano veramente la propria citt e se scrivono veramenmte per passione e non interesse sulle bellezze locali
3824850 esco quasi tutte le sere e conosco molti locali e luoghi trendy ed eleganti ristoranti dove si mangia bene e in alcuni casi anche a buon prezzo poi da sempre porto nella borsa una macchina fotografica ho la passione di fare scatti a tutto quello che mi incuriosisce lo trovo divertente poter dividere con pi persone soprattutto provenienti da fuori citt e dallestero i luoghi di roma ai quali sono pi affezionata
3824851 spesso duranti i nostri viaggi spiega sanne von poll abbiamo sentito la necessit di avere maggiori informazioni e soprattutto delle indicazioni migliori di quelle che leggevamo nelle solite guide anche quelle pi famose come lonely planet durante un viaggio a bruxelles nei primi mesi del 2007 abbiamo chiuso la nostra guida e ci siamo affidati ai consigli degli abitanti consultando internet per cera ancora qualcosa che mancava le informazioni nella nostra lingua o in inglese erano davvero poche e per di pi anche datate abbiamo trovato solo un blog di un ragazzo con i nostri stessi gusti che vive a bruxelles e seguendo i suoi consigli abbiamo trascorso una vacanza diversa dalle altre eravamo gi stati a bruxelles un paio di volte ma quella volta labbiamo vissuta come se avessimo abitato l una volta tornati a casa ci venuto in mente che sarebbe stata lora di prendere in mano le redini dei nostri viaggi e creare una guida che offrisse qualcosa di diverso e innovativo
3824852 le guide turistiche cartacee peraltro non si possono aggiornare continuamente come un sito web continua sanne in caso di cambiamenti o novit
3824853 durante uno dei nostri viaggi siamo andati in un ristorante segnalato dallultima edizione di lonely planet aggiunge bart ma il locale non esisteva pi
3824854 le persone ormai con lavvento di internet pretendono che le informazioni siano aggiornate continuamente sottolinea bart i nostri autori frequentano regolarmente e assiduamente i locali che segnalano se qualcosa dovesse cambiare sarebbero i primi a saperlo e poi i nostri lettori vogliono che le informazioni siano genuine girano voci secondo le quali molte guide vengano pagate per pubblicare recensioni positive i nostri scrittori scrivono per passione e non per soldi
3824855 da noi troverete solo i locali che i nostri scrittori apprezzano e potranno anche scrivere di qualche aspetto negativo se ne troveranno afferma bart hanno la massima libert di scrivere quello che vogliono in assoluta indipendenza
3824856 noi viaggiamo tanto dice sorridente sanne von poll i nostri amici ci chiamano

3824980 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3824981 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3824982 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3824983 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3824984 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3824985 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3824986 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3824987 wait until youre at least 10 and well discuss it
3824988 im the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude
3824989 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3824990 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3824991 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3824992 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3824993 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3824994 first we will set up a single goal to represent educational success which will take four years to achieve no matter what is being taught

3825006 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3825007 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3825008 were not saying that children never make things up but the responsible reaction is to listen carefully to allegations of abuse so that abused children will be identified and false allegations recognized
3825009 when sexually abused boys are not treated society must later deal with the resulting problems including crime suicide drug use and more sexual abuse said the studys author dr william c holmes of the university of pennsylvania school of medicine
3825010 the earlier studies found that one third of juvenile delinquents 40 percent of sexual offenders and 76 percent of serial rapists report they were sexually abused as youngsters
3825011 the suicide rate among sexually abused boys was 1 to 14 times higher and reports of multiple substance abuse among sixth grade boys who were molested was 12 to 40 times greater
3825012 holmes said a review of the studies leads him to believe 10 percent to 20 percent of all boys are sexually abused in some way but widely varying definitions of sexual abuse in the studies and differences in who was being studied make it difficult to accurately gauge the prevalence of sexual abuse he said
3825013 these results suggest two things abused kids need adequate counseling around abuse issues a lot of these kids keep re experiencing the anxiety and trauma for years
3825014 strong familial relationships may decrease the risk for disordered eating among youth reporting abuse experiences
3825015 many women and men who have been subjected to severe physical or sexual abuse during childhood suffer from long term disturbances of the psyche they may be invaded by nightmares and flashbacks much like survivors of war or conversely may freeze into benumbed calm in situations of extreme stress two recent studies find that survivors of child abuse may also have a smaller hippocampus relative to control subjects if substantiated the discovery could fill out the profile of an abuse survivor and help define what constitutes abuse

3825035 were not saying that children never make things up but the responsible reaction is to listen carefully to allegations of abuse so that abused children will be identified and false allegations recognized
3825036 when sexually abused boys are not treated society must later deal with the resulting problems including crime suicide drug use and more sexual abuse said the studys author dr william c holmes of the university of pennsylvania school of medicine
3825037 the earlier studies found that one third of juvenile delinquents 40 percent of sexual offenders and 76 percent of serial rapists report they were sexually abused as youngsters
3825038 the suicide rate among sexually abused boys was 1 to 14 times higher and reports of multiple substance abuse among sixth grade boys who were molested was 12 to 40 times greater
3825039 holmes said a review of the studies leads him to believe 10 percent to 20 percent of all boys are sexually abused in some way but widely varying definitions of sexual abuse in the studies and differences in who was being studied make it difficult to accurately gauge the prevalence of sexual abuse he said
3825040 these results suggest two things abused kids need adequate counseling around abuse issues a lot of these kids keep re experiencing the anxiety and trauma for years
3825041 strong familial relationships may decrease the risk for disordered eating among youth reporting abuse experiences
3825042 many women and men who have been subjected to severe physical or sexual abuse during childhood suffer from long term disturbances of the psyche they may be invaded by nightmares and flashbacks much like survivors of war or conversely may freeze into benumbed calm in situations of extreme stress two recent studies find that survivors of child abuse may also have a smaller hippocampus relative to control subjects if substantiated the discovery could fill out the profile of an abuse survivor and help define what constitutes abuse

3825063 this project is near and dear to me because of what it stands for as the co founder of the aranmolate foundation for deformed children and a young man who strives to help the less fortunate when i read linda katzs letter i was touched and empowered by her resilience and it further affirms the reason why the foundation exists to be a resource to families such as the katzs
3825064 when linda exhausted her reasonable options she reached out to me in tears needing help to make her home more functional for her family i was immediately touched i just knew i had to help
3825065 when i worked as a kitchen designer i met an elderly women that needed to buy a toilet she was going into the hospital to have her leg amputated and needed to purchase a new toilet i visited her home to get a better idea of her needs and what a surprise she needed so much more than just a toilet it was then i realized people were in need of healing in their homes thru functional design and thus 24 7 project was born

3825103 iphone 2 0 is ready for the enterprise but caveats apply
3825104 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and browsing
3825105 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3825106 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3825107 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3825108 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3825109 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3825110 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3825111 accept the lowered overall security footprint that adoption will dictate or block the device from use
3825112 which could be an issue if the it organization hasnt verified what apple has delivered
3825113 we strongly suggest that enterprises use existing management tools to modify the itunes registry entries to disable firmware updates file transfers and other activities that could inject unwanted content into the enterprise as well as to lock down the registry
3825114 eliminate itunes as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device as microsoft and rim have done
3825115 although we cannot confirm what is causing the battery life to be so short we believe it to be apples implementation of exchange activesync and or wi fi
3825116 apple has delivered an iphone that is acceptable for business use at the appliance level most prospective iphone users will judge the device based on consumer appeal the app store applications and the iphones excellent browser are supplemented with an e mail client which provides acceptable business capability with excellence in some areas

3825120 even in a field like astronomy its not just looking through an eyepiece but testing theories and software lets you do that
3825121 mobile phones are increasingly becoming software driven platforms although they were just for voice before
3825122 as we get screens that can roll or fold out to be bigger or mobile devices that have small screens but can project larger images on walls that line between whats a pc and a mobile will keep getting grayer
3825123 software innovation will be pervasive it will happen to other things in our lives like our cars and our tvs
3825124 lots of computing capacity and storage and at low cost
3825125 one of the fundamental questions that neuroscientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons to the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms and whole animals
3825126 this project gives us a really useful and unique opportunity to look at something that may exhibit whole behaviours but still remains closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
3825127 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction
3825128 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3825129 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3825130 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3825131 we need to learn from the experience of massachusetts and not repeat a mistake that could devastate public education in new york state
3825132 tax caps can be particularly harmful if adopted during a weak economy if a state were to adopt a property tax cap during an economic slowdown or a period of weak state revenue growth a major sustained infusion of state aid would not be possible and property tax revenue growth would be more restrained as a result schools and other services dependent on the property tax would have to be cut much more severely than in massachusetts
3825133 services may have suffered most in middle income communities as well
3825134 those who choose political expediency over the future of new yorks children and public schools and favor a gimmick that offers only the illusion of tax relief over a real reduction in property taxes for over burdened homeowners will not earn our endorsement
3825135 those candidates who have clearly taken a principled stand rejecting a cap while supporting other solutions such as a circuit breaker or restoration of the millionaires tax that would help lighten the property tax burden on senior citizens and middle class families without hammering children and their schools with an artificial tax cap
3825136 this is perhaps the most critical issue facing public education in a generation those who are taking a stand against a destructive tax cap can rightly call themselves a champion of children and equity in public education
3825137 nysut members are property taxpayers too and they too want relief but not at the expense of their schools and schoolchildren
3825138 this bad bill is not yet bad law there is still time for the senate to do right by children and public education as well as property taxpayers
3825139 nysut members live in every zip code of the state theyre passionate about the issues and volunteer to campaign for those candidates willing to fight for public education health care and the rights of working new yorkers

3825151 how to be happy this advice was given to me many years ago by a man i consider to be a genius at being happy
3825152 im 49 years old and a company director with far too much to worry me i went for a mind clearing walk through a wood the other day and in a clearing i spotted a home made swing slung from the high branches of an old oak tree after a quick check to be sure no one was watching i got on board and had the best 10 minutes of fun ive had all year i left feeling astonishingly happier i hope its still there this weekend

3825160 everybody here is thrilled for mariel not just because she graduated from valley catholic in 2003 but because of the kind of person she was when she was here
3825161 she was always extremely responsible about her assignments despite her world travel and intense fencing career she is very well thought of was friends with almost everyone and really was just one of the gang
3825162 judges brides priests we use things to look at a blank wall it isnt catholicism catholicism uses the world to point to the world beyond we touch things we kiss things it doesnt have to be cluttered but we are incarnational
3825163 the altar was smashed and tossed out on williams avenue
3825164 when you get rid of the old it discards the sacrifice of those in the past we threw the baby out with the bath water
3825165 this time we were informed about the changes that were to occur
3825166 we were given education and the beauty complements worship its not so ornate to take away from worship but its no longer a big white box the parishioners delight in this church now
3825167 because of what happened in the 1960s older parishioners were reticent at first
3825168 if our church is our home if we are going to pray there it is going to be easier in a place where we are comfortable
3825169 it is a much happier pleasant place to be now
3825170 the monastery is a wonderful place and this is a very very good fit
3825171 benedictines have always been supporters of the arts there is the monastic discipline of work and prayer the prayer is work and the work is prayer there is a sense of integration of our group with the sisters and the sisters with the iconographers
3825172 they flow into the rhythm of our community it is wonderful that they join us for prayer and eucharist during the workshop
3825173 it helps our work tremendously to have the sisters involved with us and praying for us
3825174 our goal was to give the students a way to find a prayerful time
3825175 the miniatures draw you in as small as they are there is a lot there as you work on them you are contemplating and praying they said it was a wonderful experience
3825176 we live in a world that is fast paced and out for instant gratification
3825177 this art form is definitely not fast nor is it instant gratification
3825178 what kathy and i have done over the years is to develop a structured curriculum
3825179 it starts with the simplest icon and progresses through the most complex we are trying to let the icon be the teacher our purpose is to empower students to work on their own since we are a dispersed community
3825180 there is a movement of the holy spirit to bring the beautiful back into the church
3825181 iconography is grounded in the incarnation it is not just sacred art but is a sacramental an expression of the word of god held to be on par with the written word in holy scripture
3825182 we teach not only technique but also the theology and spirituality of the icon our emphasis is on training people in the drawing of icons with a grounding in sacred geometry people come to the institute from all over the united states and canada
3825183 one of the foremost scholars in the theology of iconography he insists that a key function of the icon today is that it is ecumenical by nature and transcends our differences
3825184 its been a long two weeks for me but its over now
3825185 im happy to get an opportunity to get back on the field
3825186 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
3825187 he never ends things with a clean slate he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
3825188 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3825189 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3825190 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3825191 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3825192 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3825193 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3825194 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3825195 chris benard scobleizer here are a couple of screenshots i just took for you http is gd 1nul and http is gd 1nuo and scobleizer it s an experts exchange for programmers without all the annoyances
3825196 we can suffer our entire life over a thought that may not be true
3825197 we continue to see strong opportunities in the global military market for our portfolio of products and services as evidenced by these contracts valued at up to c 106 million in addition to our rotorsim announcement last week which is worth more than c 40 million to cae
3825198 it is encouraging to see defence forces looking more and more to modelling simulation and support services to address challenges such as maintaining readiness high operational demand on aircraft and increasing fuel costs with our global footprint and expanding capabilities to serve the entire defence systems lifecycle cae is well placed for success in our military business
3825199 the afiile program helps further establish caes leadership position in military training services in canada
3825200 we will deliver a performance oriented training solution to canadas department of national defence that will reduce the training time required to achieve proficiency while increasing overall training capacity
3825201 the royal navy is a valued customer and we are pleased that our relationship continues to strengthen the award of these contracts confirms their commitment to our command and control technology and our ability to meet their operational requirements
3825202 most of us know little or nothing about computers or how to repair them we just want a good on off switch that can be counted on
3825203 our down time is more important and is of greater potential lost monetary value than hiring a competent professional to repair our computer so that we can keep on being productive in our working and personal lives
3825204 a new breed of reporter sometimes called a one man band has become the new norm though the style of reporting has existed for years it is being adopted more widely as these reporters act as their own producer cameraman and editor and sometimes even transmit live video
3825205 we could not have hoped finding a better candidate than duncan campbell duncans appointment represents continuity in the kind of administration that westmount has typically known
3825206 after having a strong dg for many years who was well known and well connected to the community we were pleased to have mr campbell accept our offer
3825207 he has a very similar approach to municipal management and relations with citizens as his predecessor bruce st louis which will make the transition far easier than originally expected he really enjoys and cares about working in municipalities
3825208 the role of a director general is to be responsive not only to city council but to the citizens that i serve as well
3825209 im excited and feel very fortunate to join the city of westmount and look forward to the many challenges that lie ahead
3825210 the culture as well as the approach to municipal management as far as i can see at this point are somewhat similar
3825211 for the last number of years one thing i did miss from my time in tmr was the day to day operations
3825212 i felt that the culture and the fit was somewhat similar to what tmr was like if westmount was willing to take me on as director general that this was a personal opportunity for me to get back into day to day management of a first class municipality
3825213 if the border patrol doesnt get you the chicken and burgers will go vegan
3825214 we think that mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the u s they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier staple diet of corn tortillas beans rice fruits and vegetables
3825215 if you dont find god in the next person you meet it is a waste of time looking for him further
3825216 it is our duty as men and women to behave as though limits to our ability do not exist we are co creators of the universe
3825217 whatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now
3825218 the only people who get anywhere interesting are the people who get lost
3825219 and the day came when it was more painful to remain tight in a bud than the risk it took to blossom
3825220 education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army
3825221 watch your thoughts they become words watch your words they become actions watch your actions they become habits watch your habits they become character watch your character it becomes your destiny
3825222 we all know that a rocket burns most of its fuel during the first few moments of flight as it overcomes inertia and the gravitational pull of the earth thats what its like for us as we launch our dreams into physical reality
3825223 at the critical juncture in all human relationships there is only one question what would love do now
3825224 success in life is a matter not so much of talent or opportunity as of concentration and perseverance
3825225 the road to success is not to be run upon by seven leagued boots step by step little by little bit by bit that is the way to wealth that is the way to wisdom that is the way to glory pounds are the sons not of pounds but of pence
3825226 in the private sanctuary of ones own conscience lies that spirit that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential
3825227 it is never too late to be what you might have been
3825228 you are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself if you forget that errand
3825229 it had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them they went out and happened to things
3825230 wherever you are is always the right place there is never a need to fix anything to hitch up the bootstraps of the soul and start at some higher place start right where you are
3825231 everything you need you already have you are complete right now you are a whole total person not an apprentice person on the way to someplace else
3825232 who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous
3825233 this report has got nothing to do with the conservative party this is an independent think tank it has charitable status i think this report is complete rubbish it is barmy
3825234 it has produced some good work in the past but this is a very bad report sometimes they come up with good ideas and sometimes they come up with bad ideas this is a bad one
3825235 i think there is a resurgence going on in britains northern cities
3825236 it certainly wont become conservative party policy conservative party policy will continue the good work of regenerating cities right across england including northern cities
3825237 following a detailed and careful review of the file a decision has been reached that there is sufficient evidence to charge the two defendants with the murder of khyra
3825238 at this stage we do not consider funds will be available for distribution to unsecured creditors
3825239 despite the best efforts of health professionals the little girl died
3825240 a police inquiry reporting to hm coroner is now under way
3825241 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3825242 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3825243 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3825244 what we should be talking about is food security not food production
3825245 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3825246 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water
3825247 how come modern sports especially womens sports involve the exposure of private parts it is well known that the olympics both in the past and the upcoming games the worlds worst display of womens clothing is the womens olympics no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier than olympic games that include womens sports
3825248 one of these criminals compared a soccer team that made it to the top in asia and traveled to spain to the conquest of andalusia
3825249 many people nowadays watch sports rather than participate in them
3825250 if only they would run or move their bodies a little
3825251 the sport of yoga was originally a hindu game used for divine worship for them practicing yoga is a means of divine worship whoever practices yoga today is emulating their form of worship
3825252 beijing or not i call it bikini anyway because they are likely to display women in the worst possible way in these bikini olympic games
3825253 what women wear in the olympic games are among the worst clothes possible the inventions of satan with regard to the exposure of the body in gymnastics in swimming in whatever in tennis ooh so satan is a fashion designer how fabulous women have never gotten naked for sports like they do in the olympics it is aired to billions of people worldwide the problem is not just with the spectators who are present the whole thing is aired on tv
3825254 and maybe the mens clothing is more modest than the womens
3825255 there are two great sins in the world the sin of ignorance and the sin of stupidity only the former may be overcome

3825260 thousands of other republicans are going to be picking country over party in this election
3825261 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by party affiliation
3825262 one candidate john mccain who has always put country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3825263 i have a record of reaching across the aisle reaching across the aisle and working with my friends whether it be joe lieberman or ted kennedy
3825264 seeing the two different john mccains is a fracture in his credibility
3825265 this is the first election i ever actually looked at someone else other than the republican candidate
3825266 if theyre upside down on their mortgage theyll be looking for someone to blame
3825267 they ran as pragmatists offering to solve the problems of exurbanites
3825268 if obama runs a similar race or has similar appeal in those exurbs thats the road to the white house
3825269 history tells us that it takes quite a bit of economic pain to cause traditionally conservative voters to shift candidates
3825270 we would make a mistake if we would say these are just republican base areas so lets just turn out the vote
3825271 if anything these are swing areas where if we run the wrong kind of campaign we could lose those counties
3825272 the growing environmental and energy crisis cannot be solved under private ownership of the energy companies we need a mass transportation system administered by public labor community boards throughout the united states this will be financed by the nationalization of the oil gas and other energy companies all of which have thwarted mass transportation to keep profits flowing to their corporate stockholders
3825273 there is at least one na on each machine and an na must be able to start all server instances on the machine independent of the clusters to which the instances belong there can be multiple node agents on a machine for different versions of the product or in cases where the instances on the machine reside in multiple domains

3825276 has zero to do with the movie i performed in
3825277 it sends the wrong message about our movie and i just wanted you to know that i feel the pain i really love the film and i know from past missteps marketing wise that the wrong poster sends the wrong audience into the theater
3825278 det finns uppgifter som visar att ryssland skickat frivilliga fr n nordossetien
3825279 what is problematic is that this is part of a trend happening in other countries where employers drive the immigration system and determine who are let into the country
3825280 choosing newcomers based on knowledge of our labour market and experience within canadian society would make canada a more attractive destination for skilled individuals from around the world
3825281 is very short sighted because the jobs that are available to you today might not be there tomorrow thats the reality of a 21st century economy
3825282 we know those people have the best chance of success in the long term for the lower skilled workers those jobs dont tend to be around as long
3825283 most of us foreign students would love to build our future here so this program will definitely make the prospects of obtaining a permanent resident status easier and faster
3825284 a probationary immigration system is a way of using people for their disposable labour to fill jobs that others with a choice will not work in
3825285 when finley talks about a just in time flexible immigration system shes talking about more flexibility for employers deciding who and what they want
3825286 it is a dangerous move for all workers in canada

3825314 cloud computing is a new it outsourcing model that doesnt yet meet the criteria of enterprise it and isnt supported by most of the key corporate vendors its wildly popular with startups exactly fits the way small businesses like to buy things and has the potential to completely upend it as we know it
3825315 as with the web in the mid 90s every enterprise will have to develop its own cloud like capabilities or work closely with partners that do
3825316 cloud computing has all the earmarks of a disruptive innovation it is enterprise technology packaged to best fit the needs of small businesses and start ups not the enterprise

3825354 liverpool is an excellent example of a city regenerating fast with unemployment halved and increasing inward investment
3825355 in the year we celebrate being european capital of culture we should be talking up our city not doing it down
3825356 this is a counsel of despair and ignorance harking back to the tory days of margaret thatcher when norman lamont told people in the north to pack their bags and leave
3825357 we have made vast improvements since then and policy exchange would do better to recognise success rather than to send people down to the overcrowded south east
3825358 whereas some of the ideas such as greater devolution to local authorities and understanding real economic geography are interesting the proposals put forward by policy exchange relating to growth in cambridge lack any real substance or depth
3825359 the focus of growth and regeneration should be on what is right for each individual location not simply giving up on certain towns in the north and moving everyone down to the south
3825360 an explosion close to a bus in the northern lebanese city of tripoli kills at least 11 people including off duty soldiers

3825370 the presidents of georgia and russia agreed early today on a framework that could end the war that flared up here five days ago after russia reasserted its traditional dominance of the region
3825371 experts agree that russias invasion of georgia has dealt a serious blow to relations between moscow and the united states but the extent of the damage wont be known until moscow makes clear whether it will cooperate in a european led peace initiative
3825372 georgia beat russia in womens beach volleyball wednesday to the delight of the chinese crowd but animosity boiled over after the match when the russian competitors refused to acknowledge that their side actually lost to georgia alexandra shiryaeva one of the two russian players sneered that both georgian players are native born brazilians

3825379 they are our childhood heroes our babysitters our most awesome fantasies and its amazing to see how wildly and diversely artists choose to interpret them because every experience is a personal one
3825380 i was a fan of i am 8 bit because it was the one art show in la that strived to incorporate a wide variety of artists from pop painters to animators to graphic designers
3825381 this year weve tried hard to enlist new to the scene artists i am 8 bit has always been about breath and quality of work not credentials because ultimately its about great visual storytelling not fame
3825382 after undergoing major renovations to the gallery were extremely excited that such a large scale show like i am 8 bit has chosen world of wonder as its home this year
3825383 its bound to be our biggest most extravagant art event to date

3825387 customers understand the value of the expertise we bring in terms of installation and maintenance of their data storage networks
3825388 what youre seeing is those new products starting to reposition the company for growth its their best organic growth rate in the past few years
3825389 storage industry fundamentals have been healthy out of companies like and data domain even with tightening it budgets
3825390 this is a company that just reported 11 6 percent revenue growth
3825391 doubling of information every two years as a reason to drive 11 percent growth is a bit of a stretch its helping but the most important thing here is that they have a new product cycle
3825392 this was a very complementary deal in terms of technology
3825393 this deal allows us to go after both sides of the server in terms of networking
3825394 it gives us a product portfolio spanning the internet all the way into data centers
3825395 we also saw tremendous synergy opportunities in terms of customer segments

3825398 the rocky horror phenomenon has a life of its own that has reincarnated itself in numerous ways since its birth
3825399 our hope has always been that each new endeavour and rebirth will expose the rocky horror experience to new audiences and expand the fan base
3825400 the original has some qualities that cant be reproduced but a remake could have its own very different strengths and qualities
3825401 the idea of a model health certificate is not a bad idea in itself but its just impossible to police and to govern
3825402 thats why it hasnt been implemented at this stage because theres just no way of doing it
3825403 whos to say that a girl who gets this certificate lets say its valid for a year isnt going to be ok in six months time or a years time you just dont know
3825404 the british fashion council have stepped away from one of the fundamental recommendations of the model health inquiry

3825408 i was surprised that 23 per cent do not agree with the measures
3825409 this survey clearly demonstrates a need for industry professionals to educate canadians about the new measures specifically those entering the market for the first time
3825410 the measures are not seriously impacting the ability of consumers to get a mortgage
3825411 it was just enabling them to get a lower monthly payment but at a much greater interest cost

3825417 the embassy of georgia requested the call because of georgian concerns over recent russian actions dealing with south ossetia and abkhazia
3825418 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3825419 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3825420 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3825421 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions
3825422 its these sorts of appearances of a conflict of interest that are a natural consequence of having a campaign run by lobbyists staffed by lobbyists and being ensconced in a lobbyist culture for over a quarter of a century
3825423 publishers continue to snap up memoirs undermining the perception that the genre is embattled in this post frey post seltzer era

3825430 republicans have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3825431 well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3825432 being seen as in the pockets of big oil is not where you want to be as a candidate
3825433 i do believe that its a seismic event in congress
3825434 and everyone in washington has taken notice it certainly could be a harbinger of things to come
3825435 while east tennesseans have been struggling with out of control gas prices
3825436 david davis has pocketed thousands from oil companies why is big oil trying to buy our seat in congress and why is davis accepting their cash
3825437 you would think that in a republican primary attacking your opponent as a fan of big business would not work
3825438 but the proof as they say is in the pudding
3825439 it was a way to cue people into the differences between the candidates over influence and money
3825440 to say the election was a referendum on big oil i would say is a stretch
3825441 the republicans are vulnerable to the charge that this move will enrich the oil companies but have no discernible impact on prices
3825442 but in the end i think the republicans will win this one obama has already softened his stance on the issue and many democrats in congress will go along i think we are in store for more drilling no matter what happens
3825443 those who expected musharraf to seek exile elsewhere after the elections in pakistan some even talked of a plane waiting for him have proven as wrong as their nepalese counterparts who were at one point sure of the former kings flight to india
3825444 we are not apologetic about our policy on musharraf we are trying to secure an honorable and peaceful exit for him
3825445 if we give safe passage to musharraf then we should also open the gates of jails
3825446 they are asking our people for concessions yet giving their bosses a raise
3825447 it leaves a bad taste in your mouth its just not rational

3825548 the first call the cfo makes is to the marketing department
3825549 when an injurious false statement is made about an individual the individual is defamed defamation can occur in two forms libel or slander libel occurs when there is a written statement injuring an individual and slander occurs when there is an oral statement that injures an individual
3825550 since on line is considered to be written material on line defamation is considered to be libel
3825551 the libelous statement must be about an individual and the readers must be aware that the individual is the subject of the false statement
3825552 the websites of news and media organisations are increasingly embracing user generated content text messages comments discussions reviews images and videos submitted by members of their audiences
3825553 despite the benefits websites publishing this content also make themselves open to a number of risks including liability for publishing defamatory material
3825554 with respect to the internet defamation claims are generally filed for comments made in message boards or other posted material this would make them libel so these cases are frequently termed cyber libel
3825555 t he offender knows that the statement is false or acts in reckless disregard to its truth or falsity
3825556 in general facts are statements that can be proven true or false by contrast opinions are matters of belief or ideas that cannot be proven one way or the other
3825557 furthermore the defamatory statement must not be an opinion but rather one of fact
3825558 under u s law truth is an absolute defense that is if you can prove that what you wrote is true you are not at fault
3825559 o nly false statements are actionable and the supreme court has held under the first amendment there is no such thing as a false idea
3825560 a reader may well assume you have unstated facts to base your conclusion on and it would be a defamatory statement if the implied facts turn out to be false
3825561 during the last six months ive seen carol in her backyard five times at around 1 30pm on a weekday seated in a deck chair with a beer in her hand i think carol must be an alcoholic
3825562 libel lawsuits have been leveled against individuals both known and anonymous against the bloggers who let others post comments on their blogs
3825563 public figure must prove that the libeler knew the statement was false or had serious questions regarding the truth of the statement
3825564 when a message is placed on a bulletin board on the internet each location that accesses the message becomes a potential forum as long as the jurisdictional requirements for the forum are met the plaintiff can file suit
3825565 court in germany states that operators of internet forums are liable for all comments posted there even if the operator has no knowledge of their content and parties who had originally pressed charges had a right to demand that the operator cease and desist
3825566 so long as the edits do not materially change the meaning of the statement
3825567 users of the internet who violat e netiquette take the risk of getting flamed
3825568 in addition to flaming internet users often combat abuse by condemning the libelous statement and providing the public with the truth
3825569 take extra care to check your facts which can go a long way toward reducing legal risk
3825570 reply and confidently point out that criticism is not libel ask the complainant to tell you what page theyre complaining about theyll need to be specific and itll help you

3825580 you are never going to let that one go are you
3825581 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3825590 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3825591 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3825592 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3825593 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3825594 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3825595 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3825596 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3825597 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3825598 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3825599 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3825600 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3825601 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3825602 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3825603 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3825604 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3825605 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3825606 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3825607 who are open to doing something on the production side
3825608 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3825609 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3825610 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3825611 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3825612 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3825613 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3825614 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3825615 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3825616 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3825617 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3825618 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3825619 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3825620 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3825621 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3825622 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3825623 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3825624 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3825625 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3825626 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3825627 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3825628 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3825629 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3825630 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3825631 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3825632 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3825633 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3825634 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3825635 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3825636 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3825637 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3825638 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3825639 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3825640 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3825641 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3825642 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3825643 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3825644 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3825645 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3825646 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3825647 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3825648 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3825649 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3825650 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3825651 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3825652 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3825653 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3825654 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3825655 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3825656 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3825657 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3825658 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3825659 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3825660 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3825661 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3825662 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3825663 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3825664 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3825665 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3825666 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3825667 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3825668 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3825669 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3825674 the dog was in an emaciated condition he was brought in as a stray when someone called the council wardens who contacted us
3825675 but i believe the dog has definitely been owned by someone but has ended up on the streets
3825676 we are appealing for information so if anyone knows whose dog it is then they should let us know because we want to trace the owner
3825677 at the centre we will feed it up and make sure it gets healthy again and if we cant find the owner it will be up for rehoming
3825678 unfortunately dogs are abandoned all too often and we have been seeing an increase in these cases recently

3825698 er wei er hat dazu jetzt ein halbes jahr zeit pr sident bush ist offen f r einen beitritt georgiens zur nato was der nachfolger tun wird wei man nicht deshalb muss saakaschwili jetzt s dossetien und abchasien mit georgien vereinen die beiden separatistischen republiken die sich seit 20 jahren losgel st haben ohne die l sung der internen konflikte wird es keinen nato beitritt georgiens geben
3825699 saakaschwili glaubt es noch unter dem amerikanischen pr sidenten george w bush schaffen zu k nnen wenn der demokratische kandidat barack obama an der macht sein sollte wird der georgische beitritt zur nato erstmal auf mehrere jahre verlegt die nato kann nur staaten aufnehmen die keine separatistischen probleme auf ihren territorien haben es klingt wahnsinnig dass jemand einen krieg f hrt um in die nato zu kommen aber bis die frage um die separatistischen republiken s dossetien und abchasien nicht gel st ist kommt georgien nicht hinein
3825700 eamon id put my money on him i think he is in great shape its magic 47 05
3825701 i think they will go in the 46 second range
3825702 its pretty incredible i dont know what actual time they can make today but i was talking to eamon before the semi and he said you will have to go sub 48seconds to make the final so if that is any indication it will be a really hot race
3825703 i dont think so this is a new period of time in swimming a whole new level its unbelievable
3825704 it felt great i came off that turn and just felt like i didnt really expend much energy on the way out
3825705 i just used that extra energy in the second lap and swam my own race completely and could not have done anything better
3825706 i knew this morning you would have to be on your game to get through to the final and there was not going to be any holding back
3825707 i didnt watch the first semi on purpose just to make sure i focused on my own race but obviously when i heard the crowd cheer you realise what it was i heard it was only point oh faster than what i did so i knew i had a shot if i swam a good race but at the same time i was just focusing on the preparations and not on the time
3825708 records dont mean much they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately
3825709 but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure having that world record go before me i knew i had to swim my own race and not get drawn into the games about times i came out on top and am happy with the way i swam

3825713 i was held in a restaurant and physically and forcibly restrained there
3825714 i tried to explain to these people that i was a journalist but they dragged me out and slung me in in the back of a police van and held me there for another few minutes
3825715 nobody punched me but they were very forceful and i have a cut knee and a bruise on my finger
3825716 they basically dragged me into the restaurant and then out and took my shoes off me
3825717 i was able to eventually show them my journalist credentials and they realised i was a british journalist and the next time the door of the van opened i was able to walk out
3825718 they did ask me in english what my views were on tibet and i said i dont have any views im a journalist
3825719 i was there purely to report on a protest and took no part in the protest itself
3825720 we then contacted the british embassy and they are taking it up at consular level
3825721 we are aware of the incident and have spoken directly to john ray
3825722 we have expressed our strong concern to the chinese authorities and we are pleased that he has been released
3825723 john ray is a fully accredited china correspondent who was doing his legitimate job as a journalist
3825724 we intend to protest in the strongest possible terms to the chinese authorities and seek assurances that the treatment meted out to mr ray will not be repeated
3825725 the ioc has learned through media reports that a british journalist was allegedly assaulted today while covering a demonstration near an olympic venue in beijing

3825727 we are endeavouring to discover the full facts of this incident and if necessary will raise our concerns with the appropriate authority

3825765 i think its fair to say i expect capital spending to be up year over year in 2009
3825766 as you know the last time i said that i really felt our third quarter was the bottom of the trough and that we would see a modest recovery i am sticking to that at this time
3825767 the key thing to watch is this if the broad markets pull back will the technology sector emerge as a leader or laggard

3825774 hey maybe you could leave some scraps for the rest of us
3825775 we should have a state in which we could live and breathe as free men and which we could develop according to our own lights and culture and where principles of islamic social justice could find free play
3825776 pakistan not only means freedom and independence but the muslim ideology which has to be preserved which has come to us as a precious gift and treasure and which we hope other will share with us
3825777 you have to stand guard over the development and maintenance of islamic democracy islamic social justice and the equality of manhood in your own native soil
3825778 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on earth is adapted
3825779 cyber criminals are using blended attacks to distribute malware and links to hacked websites via email on an unprecedented scale
3825780 order that anyone who may cure her will be rewarded in whatever fashion they so desire
3825781 there is no one who can cure it but the witch of pythai
3825782 the witch of pythai be damned what does she have to do with me
3825783 that the witch of pythai has cast a spell on our child
3825784 she has hair the color of a rainbow and it seems to be woven of light she is tall or petite and comely in the manner that attracts you most she seems to have the grace civility and bearing of a noblewoman or the austere dignity of a matron she can be a peasant if you choose her tumbling curls in a mass around her face she is everyone and everything and she is impossible to find
3825785 well there is one way to find her like others of her kind she keeps a rare garden there are some of their creed who keep a garden of radishes or rosemary or rapunzel with which to seduce the husbands of women who are with child there are others who have rare statues in their garden and the statues of those of the men whom they have turned to stone but she is different her garden contains something very precious and very valuable she has an extract of the tree of life in her garden on that tree are three golden apples any one of those apples is enough to revive a man and keep him young and healthy until it is his time even the scent of one of them is a fragrance which revives the spirit the leaves of the tree when crushed produce a wonderous balm a tincture without equal if someone were to go to her garden in an attempt to steal her apples it is certain they would be captured but it is equally certain they would gain an audience with her
3825786 why she is named the witch of pythai for a reason
3825787 as it is she who suffers who must speak to the witch and that would mean lydia herself must go
3825788 lydia can barely eat let alone walk how can she set out for pythai and then attempt to outwit such a witch
3825789 if you will allow me to use my enchantments i can cure her
3825790 do it but only when i am out of your sight i cannot watch
3825791 that even should you be starving dying of hunger or thirst while within the witchs chamber you will eat nothing touch nothing not a seed not a fig not even a pomegranate it does not matter what she gives you you must eat nothing but the apple from the tree of life she will try to trick you perhaps in order to ensnare you be on your guard and be watchful for once you do this you shall be in her power
3825792 this is not really a hairnet though you may wear it in your hair and it will appear as such
3825793 it expands and contracts and it is stronger than the strongest rope that you could ever find if you throw it around something you will capture that item and no one will be able to lift the net but you it is also dipped in a truth serum so that when you wear it you may see things as they are and not as the witch desires them to appear take it and hide it and may god be with you my child
3825794 and would you be wanting protection for this room of yours
3825795 trencher of bread stew and blueberry pie theres ale to drink or milk if you prefer that
3825796 you may have the table to yourself if you like
3825797 why you have chosen to travel under the guise of a man i do not know but you are not safe as you are and i would guard you
3825798 as i believe i am to die i swear it
3825799 do you know who gave me that wound the witch of pythai
3825800 at my christening she was not content to cast a curse upon me but she pricked me with her knife and explained that every year on my birthday the wound would fester becoming worse with time upon my nineteenth birthday i would have to come to her whether i would or no for she planned to arrange my destiny by which i am certain she means to kill me
3825801 i will guard the door and sleep on the floor
3825802 let me travel with you to the witch of pythai
3825803 since there are two of us we should figure out a way to tackle it that involves one person being able to secure the others safety
3825804 i wish i knew what was more dangerous climbing over the fence in pursuit of the apples or staying outside to deal with the monsters that would surely come to attack he who dares
3825805 we could simply reach the apple with an object my staff for instance
3825806 the apple will not leave the tree except through human touch through the touch of a human hand a staff will merely alert the witchs guards without even guaranteeing us our success
3825807 there is no gate why i can just walk right through and take the apples no
3825808 too easy what are the chances someone is walking around able to see through this illusion certainly not very high
3825809 but i have no choice ill walk through but promise that you will flee as soon as i touch the apple i will throw it to you and you will run away
3825810 shall i tell you your future that girl whom you love
3825811 or is it in this form that you desire me
3825812 or why not sleep with her form as you desire only with me who knows so many more ways of pleasing you
3825813 only pan can do that she is the only one whom that golden net obeys it tells her the truth and it is only her touch that can undo it so i suggest you let her go
3825814 or you are going to die as will all your enchantments
3825815 if you wish to love death then who am i to deny you
3825816 only kiss her and she will turn from gold to flesh
3825817 or you shall not find your way you only found your way before because you wore the net and you could see the difference between truth and illusion if you do not remove the net you will die here for you will never find your way out
3825818 do you promise to let us out and not to kill us
3825819 only insert it into the wall just there and you shall leave
3825820 it does not matter you are destined to wed a woman with black eyes and dark hair so claimed the oracle at your birth and so you well know
3825821 it isnt gold wasnt gold its food and i have eaten of it the witch can hold me now
3825822 for i will not be so kind in the future you have met your deaths today
3825823 the darklands is a prime target and it is necessary for our enterprise if we wish to expand we must expand to the darklands for they control the black ocean which we need for purposes of shipping and transport i must fight this princess of the darklands the one of whom they speak so highly
3825824 she cannot be a natural woman for no natural woman could fight wearing the armor of men
3825825 but that is all the more reason to wed and sire an heir before heading out to war
3825826 i have heard that she is a sorceress even as her mother was
3825827 i have heard it is really a man who rides in her stead with a wig of gold to suggest that it is she
3825828 and cut her off from her men then we shall capture her at which point we can attempt to make a treaty if that will not work then we can threaten her with death unless she yields
3825829 i need a woman dressed like me to ride out to battle the prince will surely capture her it is at that point that i and my men will ambush him and i shall hold him at knifepoint there is no way that he will be able to parlay then
3825830 they are fine she took only you she has captured you but she will let you go if that will promise not to attack her lands any longer
3825831 of course not i am merely a scout you know that please if you swear you will not make war on her again she will release you and leave you free to return to your men
3825832 please come with me and i will make you my mistress
3825833 no i cannot for i love her and must serve her
3825834 she is kind for you see she has not killed you she merely wished that you would go that you would go and leave her be and leave her in peace
3825835 i promise to leave her and her lands in peace
3825836 asked the prince and a look of horror and then of shame passed over him
3825837 please tell me you are not the princess of the darklands herself
3825838 i swore long ago to make pan my mistress if i could not wed her but you i do not care for prophecies or oracles i shall marry you
3825839 the prince of arabia to marry his sworn enemy the princess of the darklands
3825840 its preposterous its cowardly its ridiculous and it goes against the oracles prophecy
3825841 and you wish to wed our enemy a man who views my kingdom as his birthright
3825842 cannot you see it as something we both want for both our own good and the good of our countries
3825843 if what you tell me is true and who knows that it isnt some concocted story you have created simply to persuade me as i do not believe it
3825844 taran i raised you to be a man not to be a slave to your passions find another blonde wench and forget her she is not your intended nor the one who is destined for you that one is black of hair with dark eyes
3825845 wed a woman any woman with dark eyes and dark hair then you will have fulfilled the prophecy of the oracle and you will be free to wed again and have this princess you desire
3825846 oh and do you think she would like another queen in her house
3825847 wed a whore if you choose pick a woman and tell her you will pay her to wed her and support her all the rest of her life so long as she does not speak of it to anyone least of all the princess and if she does you may deny it as the raving fancies of a lunatic
3825848 how do you know this prince will be true to you
3825849 send your handmaiden to him the beautiful one with her perfect skin and black curls her deep brown eyes and see if he will refrain from taking her if you think you can trust him let her come to him at night when he is weary and see if he will refrain from taking comfort with her
3825850 you will consummate the marriage or it is no marriage
3825851 i did tell you she would be the death of you did i not
3825852 he asked the expression in his eyes bitterly asking her to deny
3825853 if you will not hear me and what i wish to say then kill me but please forgive my people my sin
3825854 i would have fulfilled the prophecy if only you had trusted me
3825855 i would have darkened my hair with soot and my eyes as well would have been dark with tears or with pain but instead you chose to betray me
3825856 it is not your fault it was the witch for i ate

3825885 us company aes announced on august 1 that it had sold its 75 stake in the tbilisi electricity distributor to russian energy monopoly unified energy
3825886 western states see georgia as a key transit country for a planned pipeline to bring caspian oil to the mediterranean and are watching events there closely mindful of a chaotic civil war that gripped the country in the 1990s

3825890 leach chafee and hauser cited the presidential hopefuls approach to foreign policy and to the economy as reasons for supporting him over mccain saying the arizona senator would continue bush administration policies from the war in iraq to an unwillingness to engage enemies in direct diplomacy that have hurt americas standing in the world and its financial stability
3825891 hauser is a new york philanthropist who was a financial backer for bush in 2000 and served as a white house intelligence adviser but then endorsed democrat john kerry in 2004 owing to her opposition to the iraq war its difficult to walk away from your partys nominee but you have to put your country first

3825908 all things are created and made to bear record of me
3825909 all things denote there is a god yea even the earth and all things that are upon the face of ti yea and its motion yea and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a supreme creator

3825913 i heard in my mind not in my own voice these words
3825914 more than gratitude began to grow in my heart testimony grew i became ever more certain that our heavenly father hears and answers prayers i felt more gratitude for the softening and refining that come because of the atonement of the savior jesus christ and i grew more confident that the holy ghost can bring all things to our remembrance even things we did not notice or pay attention to when they happened

3825927 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
3825928 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture

3825934 the service is not a gold mine and any individual who thinks he or she can amass wealth through any dubious means has entered into the wrong profession
3825935 the service is not breeding grounds for indiscipline and bad elements whose primary motives is to use the colour of their uniforms to harass intimidate and extort monies from law abiding citizens
3825936 i tried to explain to these people that i was a journalist

3825941 when we came into this country we made it our commitment to improve living standards in the communities we operate in it is the deepening of our relationships with these communities that really drive the key aspect of our business
3825942 mtn is excited to be associated with the homowo festival because we believe it expresses some of the values that mtn hold dear and which drives our business throughout history and today the leadership values and the can do spirit of the ga people is made evident in a number of events we are told of how the ancestors of the ga state through their can do spirit and leadership overcame hunger incidentally these are values mtn hold dear
3825943 the goal is to walk on all the trail miles in the wilderness
3825944 i really like the idea of the mapping weeds and finding out where they are and getting them treated
3825945 ive definitely gained a knowledge of invasive weeds and their ecology
3825946 theres a direct correlation between the amount of use and the kind of use and the amount of weeds the farther back you go theres fewer weeds
3825947 learning about the weeds was great even though we didnt see that many
3825948 but they must have mixed it with a lot of water they told me it was a right mix
3825949 observers estimate that this year alone people will buy 32million digital televisions the old televisions will then get dumped in countries such as ghana
3825950 my research shows that about 90 of the computers are junk they just dont work they are obsolete not functional and they contain an array of toxic materials including lead mercury and brominated flame retardants and they are destined for disposal in their countries of origin but they are sent here where only about 10 are put to good use the rest go straight to the agbogbloshie dump site and other dump sites around the country where they contaminate ground water surface water the rivers and the streams this is simply dumping and nothing more
3825951 children in particular are highly susceptible to toxic substances which could lead to long term cancers that affect the lungs and all parts of the body
3825952 we have on a number of occasions sacked these children to go to school but they wouldnt listen im sure government is not happy about our presence here weve heard honourable abubaka saddique boniface on several occasions complaining bitterly on television about our presence here but this is our source of income and we have not alternative than to stay
3825953 i am ready to take up the mantle to prepare the ground for the upcoming generations i have no presidential ambition
3825954 dr hilla limman stepped down to be a president and later became the chief of his homeland gwollu my late uncle whom i take inspirations from in the up tradition set aside his kingship and went to parliament to serve and after that reverted
3825955 i am interested in the northern development agenda and also interested in local governance throughout the nation when given the nod i want to get to the people who would make the economy vibrant especially the farmers
3825956 at this time of our political dispensation ghana needs someone who can unite the entire nation just as alhaji has done in unifying people wherever he is chosen to lead these and many more qualities have made alhaji jawula not only a winnable bet but a person who has the ability to add more value to our presidency and help to maintain ghana as the enviable peaceful nation in the sub region
3825957 judging from all available facts sports is a major unifying factor as exhibited during the germany 2006 world cup and the just ended mtn can 2008 africa cup of nations hosted by ghana it is obvious alhaji is best positioned to use sports to unite the nation
3825958 barack obama has a problem he really really doesnt want this campaign to be about race he wants it to be about change president bush the economy gas prices iraq afghanistan almost anything else but it is going to be about race at least in part
3825959 thats the lesson of recent weeks when the mccain campaign brought up race on the pretext that obama had brought it up first the obama campaign tried desperately to change the subject but couldnt once the chum was in the water the media sharks went wild
3825960 obama should take that as a warning race will be central to this campaign because mccain needs it to be he simply doesnt have many other cards to play and it will be central because every time republicans light the match the press will create a forest fire race is just too titillating to ignore
3825961 the history of post vietnam presidential elections is littered with democratic nominees who thought they could run on policy and ignore symbolism this year the symbolism will be largely racial obama cant avoid that he needs to control the race debate instead
3825962 already there is reason to believe that race is weighing obama down
3825963 that may be possible because even racists can be wooed think about it this way many of the voters who right now wont vote for obama because hes black would probably vote for colin powell even though hes black thats because they dont see powell as a racial redistributionist a guy who would favor his community at their expense theres no rational reason to believe obama would either but because unlike powell obama is a liberal democrat who enjoys overwhelming black support thats what many racially hostile white voters assume
3825964 for these voters obama cant make race go away by ignoring it especially because the gop and the media wont he needs to acknowledge their fears and do something dramatic to assuage them paradoxically his best shot at deracializing the campaign is to explicitly make race an issue he can do that with a high profile speech and maybe a tv ad calling for the replacement of race based preferences with class based ones
3825965 that would confront head on white fears that an obama administration would favor minorities at whites expense it would be a sharper more dramatic way of making the point that obama has made ever since he took the national stage but which some whites still refuse to believe that he represents not racial division but national unity
3825966 on the merits theres a lot to say for class based affirmative action over the decades racial preferences have played a vital role in creating a black middle class but that middle class is now large and self perpetuating it is the multi generational poor whether urban and black or appalachian and white who truly need a boost today and thats what obama himself seems to believe
3825967 arguing that his own daughters shouldnt benefit from affirmative action he told the chronicle of higher education last year that
3825968 race isnt going away as a factor in american life of course
3825969 but the defining american problem of the 21st century may not be the

3825971 we have decided in the next six weeks to counter issues affecting members of the sdl party the fijian people
3825972 the strategy we have decided on is to work with christian churches especially the methodist church
3825973 two of us sdl executives are part of the methodist church think tank and the sdls stand on the charter is almost the same as the church
3825974 they receive help from the social welfare but they continue to be on the streets begging she said
3825975 they continue to beg because there are people who continue to give them money
3825976 the only option we have left is to discourage people from giving money to beggars and to those begging with children she said
3825977 how can we pay when my husband cannot find work he was working for ms elizabeth clayton but she fired him now when people see we have a house they dont want to employ us
3825978 we are not saying anything because she helped us but now because of her we are not able to get further help she said
3825979 i was selling vegetables near the settlement but i was stopped and told i had to pay the land arrears before i could do so
3825980 i am concerned at the childrens future because they are being used by the parents
3825981 these people have a racket going it is generational begging they make a huge living out of it and they are advantaged when they have children with them

3825987 work on setting up the high commission office has been progressing well
3825988 this would require an embassy to cater for the needs of solomon islanders living studying and working in fijis capital
3825989 an fcga member was elected to that post and it is only right that another fcga replace him especially because there has been no by election for the post already many of the sector councillors are nfu members
3825990 the board must act in the interests of everyone involved but that doesnt seem to be happening
3825991 it is acting more in the interests of nfu and that is not right
3825992 whichever councillor is appointed to the board must serve the best interests of the farmers and i feel that nfu members are better at it than fcga members
3825993 i really dont know what the fuss is all about
3825994 yes i admit there are more nfu members in the council than fcga but that is because the nfu does a better job
3825995 we invite friends and colleagues of urwin to take the opportunity to send their message of condolence by signing the book which will be open to people during normal working hours for the next couple of days
3825996 following consultations senior management of the secretariat have decided that to organise a memorial service fitting for urwin we have decided not to rush the arrangements
3825997 there was talk about the economy and the figures discussed by mr chaudhry and there was also talk on the infrastructure as well
3825998 a lot of people feel the private sector is the engine of the economy but it was important for us to highlight that the private sector needs the government to facilitate and enhance the growth of businesses
3825999 the operation is for throughout the country and we are equally concerned about rural areas as the urban ones
3826000 however more focus would be for the suva area because of so much happening such as the tadra kahani and hibiscus we expect a lot of people to be moving on the streets of suva and our officers will be out in numbers to patrol
3826001 we have noticed that crowd is building up in the capital and we ensure the citizens that police are there for their safety but we would like to ask people to do their part

3826009 again today the democratic house leadership is proving that they are out of touch with the needs of their constituents by skipping town for more than a month without a vote to lower gas prices to increase the supply of american made energy and to promote energy independence
3826010 before we adjourned republicans blocked several bills that would have done something to address high gas prices in the near term furthermore theyve stood against legislation to crack down on price gouging invest in renewable energy establish the first new vehicle efficiency standards in 32 years and repeal taxpayer subsidies for major oil companies that are making record profits
3826011 initially we were told that consultations would be at provincial level now they have intensified it at village level
3826012 it shows their desperate lobby for much needed support is not happening
3826013 fortunately for us since we had our provincial council meeting in april everyone knows about the charter we have no worries and they are not a threat to us at the end of the day we are not accepting the charter and the new gcc
3826014 the stand by the provincial council naitasiri province and the bose vanua is we oppose the operations of the interim government and any major changes or reforms outside the 1997 constitution

3826140 the record of my love affair with the english language
3826141 a lot of young artists will bend and sway with the wind because theyre not really sure as an artist who they are or what works for them gary always had a clear identity about who he was what he wanted to sing about and he always knew how to make songs his own
3826142 he told me he remembered when playing in the bars it just kind of clicked it all came together for him in his head what worked and what sounded good what he liked
3826143 hes always had a strong identity and thats not everybody in music these days
3826144 he had great voice great show and it kind of dictated what we did with him when we started it was definitely west coast country with that bit of bakersfield sound
3826145 this was just about the time dwight yoakam was going into movies and not focusing as much on his music and i thought there was a little bit of a void
3826146 when you cant find no one to blame you just blame yourself
3826147 i walked around this house pullin pictures off the walls
3826148 i dont know how many times you want to address the subject on an album i think that he can kind of wear it out a little bit though i hate to use that term
3826149 we know what were talking about and we know what a lot of the underlying message and themes of that record was wed already kind of done that previously i didnt know if we needed to come back and readdress it theres a moving on thing that at some point in life you have to get to
3826150 im glad we found each other with no regrets along the way even if its not forever
3826151 it had a lot to do with personal memories of what gary went through
3826152 i was with him through that whole period and it was reflective it was like some of that stuff was just starting to surface

3826197 as far as were concerned we dont think the interview is inciting
3826198 the prisoner had wanted to see a pastor from the christian fellowship mission but there was no one there at the time
3826199 so i kept him company and helped him make arrangements to have a pastor come down and see him
3826200 the previous conviction barrier that prevents ex prisoners from being employed should be erased
3826201 i can totally respect the fact that some people dont dig my music or dont want to hear it thats cool so either pause it or just dont visit
3826202 its very hard for business people to accept this you cant employ a convicted rapist in a garment factory because they have a lot of female workers well have to go out and talk with business communities to employ ex prisoners
3826203 i think it is an excellent idea and it was welcomed by the councillors
3826204 i believe nata is regretting what he did in and if somebody needs forgiveness nobody should say no
3826205 looking into his eyes you can tell he is willing to change my religion says the best gift you can give a person is forgiveness
3826206 we must forgive people like what mother earth is doing
3826207 you can do whatever you like to mother earth burn her spit on her and ploughing amongst other things but mother earth will still forgive you
3826208 ive seen wives of prisoners come with their children just to tell their partners they want to move on with their life

3826212 if he fights back we are with him we will support him and that is the preferred option
3826213 using that power would be undemocratic under the present circumstances even though it is in the constitution the democratic process should continue

3826221 it was raining heavily and we did hear the dogs bark but did not expect a robbery was taking place
3826222 we found out in the morning when my son went to feed them there were 22 chickens now all are gone
3826223 i called them several times and even lodged a full complaint but no one came to attend to my case until thursday i just buried the four dead chickens because i was waiting for the officers to come and see for themselves
3826224 its pathetic that these officers are not bothered about what affects the people and the trauma we are going through because of thieves
3826225 i plead with the commissioner to please rotate the officers at navua police station because we dont think they are doing their job of protecting the people and safeguarding our interests
3826226 last year during the off season i thought of planting some vegetables
3826227 the size and quality of tomatoes i harvested was similar to new zealand tomatoes and i could not believe that we too can achieve that
3826228 with that top quality and extra exorbitant price of new zealand tomatoes finding a market was easy because whenever i took my produce to the market they would be snapped within hours

3826236 if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3826237 the citizens deserve peace believe that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution

3826250 entendemos que essa uma decis o exclusiva e soberana do governo e do congresso nacional mas achamos que para o governo atingir o objetivo n o precisaria de uma mudan a radical na lei do petr leo podem ser feitas mudan as cir rgicas como por exemplo na quest o dos royalties
3826251 essa mudan a alcan aria mais da metade da arrecada o j que a al quota dos royalties varia de 5 a 10 ent o o governo poderia mexer na distribui o dos royalties mexendo na lei 7 990

3826284 warfarin sometimes masquerades as diazepam 10mg for someone who doesnt need warfarin it could be fatal as you could bleed to death
3826285 my plea is to anyone who feels they want these medicines do not buy them from illegal sources its much too dangerous
3826286 as many people on these tablets now as there were during the troubles
3826287 were buying blue tablets on the street with no identification or markings on them they assumed it was diazepam 10mg but they could have been given anything
3826288 no one knows for sure whats in the tablets unless theyre clinically tested
3826289 this can be a difficult group of patients what we dont want are those patients disappearing and buying them on the black market
3826290 we want an environment where they can be referred on to more specialised practitioners

3826295 the launch today of this pilot means that young scots will soon be able to take part in sport with a greater degree of safety than in the past and help avoid the tragedy of further preventable deaths
3826296 its a big step forward to get a pilot scheme

3826507 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3826508 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3826530 hes a very nice guy they were very happy and relaxed and having fun
3826531 we are great actually we have been friends for three years now
3826532 we are very good friends people always want to know what it is and what it isnt people think they know they try to guess sometimes you just need your privacy but it comes with the territory theres no privacy when you are out in the public
3826533 we blamed it on my daughter who had the control thinking she had pushed the wrong button
3826534 the whole room went silent we were dumbfounded i couldnt believe it could happen right at that time

3826539 john mccain also believes that tax cuts work best when tied to spending restraint
3826540 he has a 26 year pro life voting record and has pledged to appoint conservative judges who will interpret the law not legislate from the bench
3826541 reeds hypocrisy is legion now matched only by john mccains attending a fundraiser hes helping host
3826542 reed was involved in money laundering and mccains investigation uncovered it
3826543 this is a mistake by the mccain campaign i would be very surprised if he doesnt cancel this event
3826544 i find it laughable watchdog groups would go this route considering sen mccain chaired the senate indian affairs committee that investigated jack abramoff i suggest they take a closer look at barack obamas friends like convicted felon tony rezko or his national co chairman harry reid who took nearly 68 000 from abramoff
3826545 calling yourself a maverick and claiming credit for fighting corruption while raising money with one of the central figures in the jack abramoff corruption scandal is not what most voters have in mind when they think of straight talk
3826546 it is however one more example of why john mccain is offering more of the same failed republican leadership
3826547 i am just strongly supporting sen mccain im contributing to him and encouraging others to do so
3826548 how many people have been charged or indicted or accused of wrongdoing in that matter
3826549 i fully cooperated with the investigation and i was never accused of wrongdoing
3826550 i stated at the outset of the work that i would not be paid with any gambling revenues and none of the funds paid by me through the law firm or anyone else were from gambling
3826551 draft language that was pre approved and provided for people raising funds for the campaign
3826552 i really dont even know i couldnt give you a number look they were just friends people ive worked with over many years
3826553 he is connected with christian conservatives and hes a pretty savvy political operator
3826554 this is the time when youve got to get all the forces in the party together

3826565 humiliated by airport workers who unpacked his bags in front of dozens of other passengers
3826566 i was treated like a common criminal for absolutely no reason at all
3826567 there were nearly 40 people in the airport queue that day and the only difference between us was that i was black and everyone else was white
3826568 that is clearly wrong nobody should be have to face prejudice of any kind regardless of their country of origin or the colour of their skin
3826569 hopefully the company will now make changes and they will make sure they dont have to pay out another 4 000 to someone else out there
3826570 at 6 45 in the evening theres got to be more witnesses
3826571 and were not concerned that they did not come forward immediately some may think what they witnessed is insignificant but that may not be the case
3826572 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3826573 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3826574 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3826575 ahora m s que nunca los usuarios europeos tendr n m s libertad para poder satisfacer sus necesidades en el mbito del entretenimiento digital esta libertad viene adem s sin costes adicionales

3826577 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such treatments would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
3826578 this is a new approach to the treatment of drug addiction that has great potential additionally this might also be used to treat other neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by maladaptive memories including post traumatic stress and phobic anxiety disorders
3826579 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3826580 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3826581 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3826582 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3826583 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
3826584 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
3826585 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
3826586 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
3826587 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
3826588 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
3826589 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes

3826607 without om shanti bath salts i simply refuse to bathe
3826608 we know the process now we know what we are looking for
3826609 the standards have been set we work so well together so i couldnt be happier as a head coach to have chris alex and christina back
3826610 this year will be their third running the system and we will really look to them to guide the group
3826611 they are our coaches on the field and really help us instruct and control play its a very young team but i think that is going to play to be a strength for us our first years have a lot of international experience its a fairly large group and with youth you always have enthusiasm so it will be a second straight year of a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of laughing
3826612 if you want to be the best you have to play the best
3826613 we are trying to get there and thats how you do it by playing the best we will take our lumps no doubt but we will only get there lumps and all if we play the best
3826614 the forward line has a good ability to finish and they all have different scoring styles
3826615 we hope we have added some speed with the incoming class so hopefully that will be one of our strengths
3826616 we will be a little faster in the off ball runs and to get into position and on the counter attack
3826617 we have a nice balance of youngsters and veterans in the middle
3826618 the new kids will have a chance to learn our style of play from the upperclassmen we are counting on the first years to add more speed to the midfield
3826619 most of the backfield players have one or two solid years behind them
3826620 and we are hoping our first years can help us right away as well
3826621 desj and devon played together last year and really stepped it up in the middle of the season
3826622 they came together to make a great team and together they will mentor adrienne
3826623 penn state is going to be strong and will again challenge for the national championship
3826624 iowa is very strong also as they won the big ten tournament last year that is going to be a really tell tale weekend in terms of where we stand in the middle of october
3826625 we play william amp mary odu and james madison within first two weeks of the season
3826626 those games are never easy because everyone fights for in state bragging rights all those games will be a battle because of that
3826627 carolina will be strong returning a significant amount of players coming off an undefeated season
3826628 i would imagine they will have a lot of confidence going in to start the year

3826643 many years ago when i was a college student i took a course from john kenneth galbraith on the first day of class professor galbraith gave a brilliant opening lecture after which the students gave him a standing ovation galbraith kept on giving brilliant opening lectures the whole semester but instead of standing ovations there were now dwindling numbers of students and some of them got up and walked out in the middle of his lectures galbraith never got beyond the glittering generalities that marked his first lecture after a while the students got tired of not getting any real substance senator barack obamas campaign this year reminds me very much of that course from professor galbraith

3826648 alternative fuels are crucial to the future of formula 1 and formula student is leading the way with the future of engineering and highlighting the importance of developing greener technologies such as hybrid and hydrogen for transport and the environment
3826649 formula student is europes biggest student motorsport event and it inspires the next generation of engineers develops their skills and provides invaluable practical experience
3826650 it is important that the next generation of engineers appreciate the importance of applying sustainable technology within the automotive sector
3826651 they will be responsible for developing the designing the green cars that many of us will be using in the future in the drive to combat carbon emissions
3826652 the design of highly complex alternative powered vehicles is one the greatest challenges that the international automotive industry is currently facing and in many regards formula student is at the forefront of this challenge
3826653 historically oems who wanted a high degree of precision and throughput from their servo drives were required to specify systems with higher power capabilities

3826661 because he wants to control all the area and say to the international community no sla no jem no anything now we have got a peace by force
3826662 let us not put too much searchlight on one party we have over 30 groups on the ground command and control is lost completely by the movements i am not in any way saying that the government is clean but what i am saying is that also the other side cannot be said to be saints

3826676 the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws many democrats believe bans on most guns are common sense and they still support the handgun ban in barack obamas hometown of chicago boiled down all it really means is that the democrats are still the party of gun control no matter how they try to re package the rhetoric and they know it
3826677 the partys gun control platform plank puts the lie to everything they say
3826678 as democrats descend on denver to nominate a candidate who is on record in opposition to sensible concealed carry laws we encourage gun owners across the country and especially in colorado to remind the party that the supreme court in june held that gun bans are unconstitutional
3826679 even after a study done for the justice department found that gun shows are rarely the source of firearms used by criminals
3826680 democrats have an opportunity to reject and repudiate this platform
3826681 if they do not that tells american gun owners everything they need to know about democrats as november approaches

3826686 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3826687 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3826688 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3826689 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3826690 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems

3826715 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats

3826750 the difficulty in understanding the russian is that we do not take cognizance of the fact that he is not a european but an asiatic and therefore thinks deviously we can no more understand a russian than a chinese or a japanese from what i have seen of them i have no particular desire to understand them except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them in addition to his other amiable characteristics the russians have no regard for human life and they are all out sons of bitches barbarians and chronic drunks
3826751 russia knows what it wants world domination and she is laying her plans accordingly we on the other hand and england and france to a lesser extent dont know what we want and get less than nothing as the result

3826758 as a longtime vegetarian i dont really love wearing leather but with cindy i am probably going to have to put my morals aside and buy some cow at some point
3826759 shes got a lot of leather coats but thats ok there is room in my closet right next to my blue pantsuit and matching beads
3826760 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3826761 oh you guys have an inside joke how absolutely wonderful for you both
3826762 i might be a fag but i dont like nuts in my tea
3826763 oh you guys have an inside joke how absolutely wonderful for you both
3826764 many of the people in that newsroom deserve this honor just as much as i do to see those people stand up for those ethical guidelines was really neat

3826808 i think weve overplayed it but wolverines am i right
3826809 it has enough assholishness but unfortunately its still pretty funny no we need something that will not only appeal to our base but actively piss off liberals a movie that only a conservative ideologue could love
3826810 hm ive got something is kelsey grammar doing anything these days
3826811 this is where the real musical talent plays and i suppose we do go the extra mile for them but this stage is respected by the performers engineers and audience because of the consistency of the sound jazz world uses the same pa every year and we bring good experienced crew

3826815 located in p tion ville haiti sopudep school is a comprehensive public school serving the poorest residents of the city founded in 2002 the school has grown to over 400 students many of who receive their only regular meal through the schools hot lunch program
3826816 the economic reality of haiti is such that a large proportion of children are inadequately nourished and unable to concentrate while in school i have seen the glazed look of hungry children in haitis schools sopudep has responded to this reality by instituting a feeding program guaranteeing hundreds of children one square meal every day of the week so they can focus on their studies
3826817 to post signs for her new project in the building and hold a press conference
3826818 sopudep school and the staff are a shining light for the children of haiti with nothing more than their own determination they have built a school that provides an unbelievable service to children that would otherwise have no means of obtaining any kind of education
3826819 it greatly disturbs me that such a success story in haiti should be under attack i have never met people more committed to doing what is right for the children of the community than the staff at sopudep school
3826820 the economic reality of haiti is such that a large proportion of children are inadequately nourished and unable to concentrate while in school i have seen the glazed look of hungry children in haitis schools sopudep has responded to this reality by instituting a feeding program guaranteeing hundreds of children one square meal every day of the week so they can focus on their studies
3826821 by closing sopudep school the mayor of p tion ville is clearly showing a complete lack of concern for the health and future of her communitys most vulnerable members

3826836 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3826837 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3826838 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3826839 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3826840 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3826841 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well

3826849 was primarily the result of advertising revenue growth in the classified category
3826850 overall revenue growth for the quarter was lower than we were expecting largely the result of lower spending levels by some of our national advertisers

3826853 i want to finish my career at chelsea it is something ive said many times and after signing this contract i am very happy and positive i will finish as a player here
3826854 it has taken a while to get the deal done and there has been a bit of compromise on both sides lampard said
3826855 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes scolari said
3826856 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with every day he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3826857 were in that eighth through 13th class thats going to fight right down to richmond unless one of us breaks out gets a win a couple of top fives and locks ourselves in the next two races he said
3826858 weve had a legacy of having really fast cars i think of having generally pretty good engines and better than average luck there team owner jack roush said
3826859 the thing i love about michigan is you can race as hard as you want biffle said
3826860 you can go two and three wide on that downforce racetrack for the win and be able to do that in a cautious manner where youre going to get a good finish
3826861 to run two feet off the wall at michigan is id like to say a dangerous line because one little mistake and it wipes the right side of the car off he said
3826862 greg should certainly be ok given the mix of races weve got left roush said
3826863 but man weve got to miss the wreck and we cant have a part that breaks who gets in will be more determined by things gone wrong than it will by blinding speed
3826864 we won six races in 2005 and it just kind of slips away from your fingers and you dont ever really know what you did wrong or what happened just enjoy it while you can
3826865 i want to be the best i can be and be prepared to give a run at the title biffle said
3826866 formula atlantic was fun grand am was great to drive but nascar is the most fun ive ever had racing

3826868 i think gillett evernham is pretty happy most of the sponsors that were at our sponsor summit in montreal were happy valvoline lifelock auto value i hope gillett evernham is happy as well because i like being here and i like driving this car
3826869 were just so elated i dont know what word to choose
3826870 we had one last night and cleared 700 that can help the cost with renting a car
3826871 i think common sense would have to tell you it would have some impact on peoples ability to travel and follow their kids
3826872 but on the other side of coin kids participation in sports and especially on the little league trail is something that many parents make sacrifices to do
3826873 its one of those things take that part of life out and go through and enjoy it
3826874 its going to be hectic but once i leave im just going to be thinking about baseball
3826875 one of the first questions from the coaches in south williamsport is how do i get on the wireless
3826876 i love baseball ive been coaching for 22 years my heart is with the kids
3826877 theres no one who can improve on mourinhos record really it would have to go beyond mourinhos performance to really worry us and that will be a challenge with the players theyve got and the players theyve added
3826878 i believe we were very unlucky last season we lost the premier league by four points
3826879 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
3826880 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
3826881 we started really well and finished really well last season if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season

3826892 this statue brings back so many memories of peace love and happiness
3826893 there is so much romance in the statue it gives such a feeling of hope to all who look at it
3826894 during the moment of the kiss i dont remember much it happened so fast and it happened at the perfect time i didnt even look at the sailor who was kissing me
3826895 i closed my eyes and enjoyed the moment like any woman would have done
3826896 its a classic symbol of a sailor i cant put into words the honor it is to meet the woman that was in the photograph and to be a part of the official ceremony for such an amazing piece of work
3826897 this photo and statue still moves me to this day
3826898 its nice to know that people havent forgotten about that moment in history this moment is so precious and can never be duplicated

3826945 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3826946 he is not from another planet he is from the future

3827032 they want to come in where theres an opportunity to invest some capital and take an ownership position but leave the operations in the hands of management
3827033 the economics on the expansions could look pretty attractive in terms of the payback and rate of returns
3827034 the problem is usually those big internationals want to operate as well in this case i would be very surprised if harvest gave up operatorship of the refinery

3827060 to effectively couple the sale with environmental benefit clients need to understand that mortgagegreen outperforms most other lenders pricing at no additional burden to the borrower financial or otherwise
3827061 it is possible to provide these benefits easily with minimal impact to the lenders bottom line to greatly enhance sustainability and provide a huge windfall in customer loyalty
3827062 greening up is about more than just saving energy mortgagegreen feels it has an obligation to the public to educate to boost awareness and provide solutions for minimizing our impact on the environment

3827075 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3827076 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that

3827087 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3827088 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3827089 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3827090 my time was pretty average i have had a lot of experience at 200 of going out too fast and struggling at the end at the worlds i went off ridiculously fast and got smashed on the last 50 but i have learned from my mistakes

3827193 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
3827194 if someone forces you to go one mile go with him two miles
3827195 i say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will take their places at the feast with abraham isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
3827196 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3827197 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3827198 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3827199 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3827200 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3827201 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3827202 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3827203 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3827204 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3827205 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3827206 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3827207 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3827208 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3827209 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else

3827224 at that age i thought he was a saint and a square and he took himself too seriously
3827225 i would ask him why he was so serious he was genuinely concerned with the plight of the poor hed give me lectures which i found very boring he must have found me very irritating
3827226 we were both very lost we were both alienated although he might not put it that way he arrived disheveled and without a place to stay

3827233 trustees by law can only approve balanced budgets and sierras board has always done so
3827234 to meet short term deficits trustees may choose to use either reserve balances or make transfers from other funds to achieve balance with equal integrity
3827235 sierra college is presently using a definition of balanced budget not evidently used by another california community college
3827236 sierra colleges finances have been well managed at least since 1995 the financial condition of the school has in fact worsened since 2004
3827237 placer county is virtually the only populous county in the state which has not supported its college with the passage of a prop 39 bond issue
3827238 this game we had more balance in the number of players scoring

3827240 bill martins actions today sadden me because he has issued yet another report riddled with inaccuracies and falsehoods this new report contradicts his own record of voting without objection for the budgets and policies he now so vehemently criticizes
3827241 at our july 19 meeting bill tried to convince the board to abolish our balanced budget policy and in a 6 1 vote failed to convince even one trustee to join his ridiculous idea that you can balance a budget by borrowing money from reserves or other funds
3827242 this reminds me of years ago prior to our current management team when the college was reprimanded for borrowing funds from a retiree trust fund to balance the budget and was forced to repay those funds back to the retiree trust with interest
3827243 despite bills desperate attempts to paint the college in a negative light respected community leaders agree sierra college is better off than it was four years ago bill needs to issue a retraction and apology to all six of his board colleagues
3827244 im a firm believer in looking at the results and aaron has achieved results at sierra college he has worked to balance the budget build up strong surpluses and make it possible for the college to make it through this economic downturn without massive cuts im proud to support him for re election
3827245 before aaron was elected our budget suffered tremendous cuts he has worked diligently to make sure the budget is balanced and he has protected our academic freedom all our community has to do is to look at our financial standing and take a look at the curriculum which has been approved in recent years as proof of aarons performance as a board member i strongly support his re election

3827252 im sure what happened in georgia will change the level of relations between the eu and russia
3827253 i would say it is impossible that everything continues as if nothing had happened
3827254 some states which were maybe too idealist towards russia in the past have also realized that the eu should be clearer and stronger
3827255 with due skill care and diligence and failing to organize and control their business effectively
3827256 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence

3827295 when you look at the labour market in order to make that shift youre going to need a workforce of people who are resident in the community part of the tourist experience is an experience from a local delivered by a local whos been here more than two weeks

3827307 my daughter looked so good in that car with her 7 year old son alongside her and to go out there and see it with a big boot mark in the side its just senseless
3827308 this has been a real setback for me but people should know the effect of what they do on people
3827309 this is just senseless vandalism it is the last thing we need

3827312 it will be significant but not equivalent to the total number of available units
3827313 previous falls in the exchange rate have not been sustained because interest rates have not been cut by the reserve bank but this time they have this one will stick
3827314 while there is a positive flow on from the lower nz dollar this is really just helping counterbalance the softening were seeing in commodity prices
3827315 its good to see the currency moving in the right direction but at this stage from a payout perspective ones largely cancelling the other out
3827316 yes it is a good thing even though the price of imported products is likely to rise

3827321 saakaschwili glaubt es noch unter dem amerikanischen pr sidenten george w bush schaffen zu k nnen wenn der demokratische kandidat barack obama an der macht sein sollte wird der georgische beitritt zur nato erstmal auf mehrere jahre verlegt die nato kann nur staaten aufnehmen die keine separatistischen probleme auf ihren territorien haben es klingt wahnsinnig dass jemand einen krieg f hrt um in die nato zu kommen aber bis die frage um die separatistischen republiken s dossetien und abchasien nicht gel st ist kommt georgien nicht hinein

3827335 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
3827336 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
3827337 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
3827338 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
3827339 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
3827340 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
3827341 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system

3827354 touch sight is a revolutionary digital camera designed for visually impaired people simple features make it easy to use including a unique feature which records sound for three seconds after pressing the shutter button the user can then use the sound as reference when reviewing and managing the photos touch sight does not have an lcd but instead has a lightweight flexible braille display sheet which displays a 3d image by embossing the surface allowing the user to touch their photo the sound file and picture document combine to become a touchable photo that is saved in the device and can be uploaded to share with others and downloaded to other touch sight cameras
3827355 at the beit haiver center for the blind in herzliya israel the instructor who teaches a photography course for the visually impaired discovered that holding the camera to the forehead like a third eye is the best way for them to stabilize and aim the camera the instructor also found the visually impaired have no problems estimating distances since their sense of hearing is especially sharp every rustle of wind in the trees catches their attention and can be used to judge distances other senses come into play as well the heat of the sun or a lamp in a living room for example signals a direct source of light they regularly use their non visual senses to feel the world and manifest it into a mental photograph

3827360 i believe we were very unlucky last season we lost the premier league by four points
3827361 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year
3827362 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
3827363 we started really well and finished really well last season if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season
3827364 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
3827365 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
3827366 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
3827367 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
3827368 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
3827369 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
3827370 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
3827371 were not ever really with people cause were always traveling

3827374 we are secret agents and our cover is that were a band
3827375 everyone knew it was going to be about spies and thats changed a little bit i guess cause in the course of the last two years the band has changed a little bit were going to be the jonas brothers going through life like going to school but still being the jonas brothers

3827382 thank you for replying after that long as far as i know my blog was never down but thank you for informing me about this issue funny thing is that is hosted on blogger a google service so you say that google adsense could not accept my application becouse google blogger is difficult to navigate on maybe if i will change to wordpress everything will be ok and the blog will never be down i think this will go straight to my blog the site you reviewed all the best

3827394 bring the world into focus sic represent it in proper perspective
3827395 to move a few feet away from the frontal contemplation of the painting is to efface everything within to bring death into the world
3827396 they want to come in where there s an opportunity to invest some capital and take an ownership position but leave the operations in the hands of management
3827397 the economics on the expansions could look pretty attractive in terms of the payback and rate of returns
3827398 the problem is usually those big internationals want to operate as well in this case i would be very surprised if harvest gave up operatorship of the refinery
3827399 it s actually cheaper to ship it than it is to pipeline it from the refining area down in the gulf of mexico
3827400 there actually is a geographic advantage to where they re at right now
3827401 having that flexibility helps them when gasoline margins are so weak in north america they can actually ship that away
3827402 in our view financing such a significant expansion could prove to be a major challenge harvest already boasts the most levered balance sheet in the sector and is not likely to retire any debt going forward as the entirety of its cash flow will be required for capital spending and distributions

3827408 attending to first movements and deciding whether to act on them or to let them go of them was for john of the cross an essential spiritual practice in disposing oneself for contemplation the mental discipline of attending to first movements thus requires 1 awareness that these movements are occurring 2 peaceful acknowledgement of these movements as present in our consciousness no matter how disturbing they may be and 3 deciding whether to act on these movements or to let them pass out of consciousness as we develop the habit of acting only on those movements which procure the honor and glory of god a 3 20 3 and letting go of those which do not we gradually create the interior emptiness that best disposes us to receive the inflow of gods loving knowledge in contemplation that increasing fills our consciousness and directs our lives

3827487 provided recreation and socialization space for adults and special play environments for children small symmetrically planned and offered little illusion of countryside or nature their principal architectural innovation was the fieldhouse which was meant to provide a clubhouse of sorts for the working class
3827488 parks were a recognized government service needing no justification like socializing immigrants or halting disease the emphasis instead turned to establishing government norms and extending service to the suburbs and urban areas that hadnt yet received a standard of treatment
3827489 recreation came to be seen as something that could take place anywhere in the street on a rooftop at a waterfront along an abandoned rail line or in a more traditional plaza or park a more artistic participatory sensibility emerged prompting a closer tie between park programming and popular culture parks came to be conceived as a network of disparate public serving participatory facilities

3827503 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3827504 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3827505 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3827506 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3827507 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3827508 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3827509 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3827514 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3827515 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3827516 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3827517 this military is telling president pervez musharraf please step down and avoid further humiliation for yourself and also for the army
3827518 the military has probably concluded that president musharraf staying on as the president will only cause more divisions in pakistan
3827519 in public we say the military must remain neutral but in private we all know the military is a powerful player and they have to be on board
3827520 even if by some luck president musharraf survives and carries on the military wants to make clear that it would have no responsibility for that outcome
3827521 the illegitimate gangster government exerts influence everywhere but it no longer rules because the king has returned
3827522 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3827523 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3827524 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3827525 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3827526 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far

3827531 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3827532 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well
3827533 weve had a few false starts and ive had to run a couple of laps no big deal
3827534 no one wants to see that you want it to run like it should and i think for the most part weve done that now they havent thrown everything at me but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3827535 a number of factors inimical to growth have intensified in 2008
3827536 no country except the large commodity exporting nations can perhaps expect to emerge unscathed from such adverse worldwide conditions
3827537 inflation growth and other macro economic outcomes are all likely to be severely impacted
3827538 theres a slowdown in agriculture industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth this will affect the indian economy
3827539 be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets
3827540 the risk is that an abrupt slowing in asia could occur sometime in late 2008 to early 2009

3827545 committed to reaching an agreement that upholds the will of the people
3827546 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3827547 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008
3827548 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3827549 without further delay we are demanding that ngos be allowed to resume humanitarian assistance distributing food medicines and life saving assistance this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter

3827556 as governor of virginia warner used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia
3827557 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3827558 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how to renew americas promise
3827559 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that shape him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
3827560 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3827561 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3827562 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3827563 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3827564 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3827565 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3827566 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3827567 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3827568 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3827569 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3827570 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3827571 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3827572 wir kennen sie und wir m gen nicht was sie tun
3827573 theres a whole world of music that you dont hear anymore and its on 78 rpm records
3827574 i really didnt know there were so many people in the world interested in this music
3827575 a lot of younger people go to the site and its amazing that they hear songs today that originally were recorded 75 years ago its pretty cool that people get to listen to this stuff as far as copyrights apparently im okay because nobodys come to shut me down or anything
3827576 please note that what was considered humor early in the 20th century might today be deemed offensive and politically incorrect some of these old songs reflect that
3827577 my wife told me that i shouldnt put those songs on there because theyre racially offensive or sexually offensive so i asked around and people said you know first amendment do anything you want
3827578 i have an old 1950s gerard turntable that i bought at an estate sale for two and a half bucks and its got a ge general electric vr cartridge in it which is just excellent for playing 78s
3827579 i get dozens of emails every day from people telling me how wonderful it is to hear this music and people post links to my webpage on websites all over the world
3827580 i think theres only like 150 more songs on the list to go but ive got about 2500 more records to record
3827581 and itll probably take me another 10 or 15 years to

3827607 considering it takes 300 people to make an episode of lost im just in awe of the accomplishment of dr horrible
3827608 maybe thats how well do the zombie season of lost
3827609 how does the tv show exist with the movie franchise are they two separate worlds do you take inspiration from it
3827610 weve always felt that the tv show is its own expression of a version of the terminator universe
3827611 and the movies are an expression of the terminator universe and i think the fans understand that theres different expressions within a mythology
3827612 he sent a box of cookies i believe that said if you give away any more of our secrets well kill you because lost is a tv show and chuck is real
3827613 what was it like launching two tv shows at once

3827787 i really didnt know there were so many people in the world interested in this music
3827788 a lot of younger people go to the site and its amazing that they hear songs today that originally were recorded 75 years ago its pretty cool that people get to listen to this stuff as far as copyrights apparently im okay because nobodys come to shut me down or anything
3827789 please note that what was considered humor early in the 20th century might today be deemed offensive and politically incorrect some of these old songs reflect that

3827834 this is another key patent in our broad patent portfolio that furthers our commitment at spectrascience to develop better more reliable cancer screening technologies the patent is important to the companys optical biopsy technology because in screening for some forms of cancer the optical response of the tissue is captured in a sequence of images that are characterized by analyzing the time dependent response of the tissue as recorded in the sequence during this type of screening the tissue may move while images are being taken resulting in a spatial shift within the image frame field being able to correct for this shift increases the effectiveness of the optical biopsy procedure tissue movement can be caused by the natural movement of the patient during the procedure which can occur despite a patients attempts to remain completely still this patent provides for an accurate analysis of the sequence of images which would otherwise be misaligned due to movement of the tissue hitchin added accurate imaging is critical to earlier and more effective identification of abnormal pre cancerous and or cancerous tissue and this invention provides methods of determining a correction for a misalignment in the imaging process that will make our screening devices more powerful to the physician and more important to the patient

3827838 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

3827932 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3827933 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

3827945 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3827946 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3827947 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3827948 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3827949 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3827950 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3827951 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3827952 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3827953 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3827954 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3827955 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3827956 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3827957 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3827958 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3827959 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3827960 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3827961 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3827962 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3827963 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3827964 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3827965 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3827966 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3827967 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3827968 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3827969 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3827970 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3827974 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3827975 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3827976 either obvious ties to the republican party or are regularly touted by gop politicians as democratic defectors
3827977 from my perspective this is simply not a time for politics as usual
3827978 the case for inspiring new political leadership and a social ethic has seldom been more self evident
3827979 barack obamas platform is a call for change but the change that he is so gracefully articulating is more renewal than departure while a break from the ideological policies of the moment it is rooted in very old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition theres an emphasis on individual rights fairness and balance at home and progressive internationalism
3827980 it is not traditional republicanism to make war on everybody who disagree with you
3827981 seeing the two different john mccains is a fracture in his credibility
3827982 a couple of hundred thousand names we hope it will grow exponentially as we go through the campaign

3827986 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3827987 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3827988 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3827989 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3827990 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3827991 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3827992 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3827993 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3827994 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3827995 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3827996 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3827997 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3827998 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3827999 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3828000 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3828001 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3828002 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3828003 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3828004 the pain of consummation theres that somehow ambiguous word again soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
3828005 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3828006 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3828007 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3828008 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3828009 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3828010 the americans are not ready to allow us to attack iran
3828011 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
3828012 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
3828013 saakashvili was mad enough to go in the middle of the night and bomb a city
3828014 the georgians fell into a vulgar trap they thought that russian prime minister vladimir putin would not retaliate in the middle of the olympic games
3828015 they sent in the russian army and liquidated the opposing army
3828016 if georgian president mikheil saakashvilis absurd demand that the peacekeeping operation be halted in abkhazia is implemented the region will risk being plunged deeper into crisis by the unhealthy ambitions of the incumbent georgian authorities
3828017 considering this we think it impossible to resolve the fate of the peacekeeping operation without taking into account the opinion of the abkhazian side
3828018 man muss eigentlich darauf gefasst sein dass irgendwann einmal ein reifenschaden auftritt
3828019 bislang hatte ich in meiner karriere gl cklicherweise keinen einzigen platten aber dass es ausgerechnet passieren musste wo ich nur noch f nf kilometer vom sieg entfernt war
3828020 ich h tte losweinen k nnen denn da wusste ich dass mein wochenende vorbei war
3828021 ich w rde in brands hatch weder siegen noch punkte holen das hat mich schon etwas fertig gemacht
3828022 um diesem wochenende zumindest etwas positives abzugewinnen wir werden in oschersleben zehn kilogramm weniger ballast an bord haben ich werde also einer der leichtesten fronttriebler sein
3828023 ich muss brands hatch einfach abhaken und als charakterbildend verstehen und in deutschland wieder versuchen den sieg zu holen
3828024 what happened on the night of august 7 is beyond comprehension
3828025 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas
3828026 russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
3828027 nevertheless it was still possible to find a political solution clearly the only way to solve the south ossetian problem on that basis is through peaceful means the georgian leadership flouted this key principle
3828028 the georgian government and its supporters should rethink their position
3828029 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbash as outlined in mr suskinds book

3828036 my accreditation was in my pocket but they wouldnt let me get it out to show them
3828037 i could see that they threw in behind me a yellow tibetan flag or banner i couldnt see exactly what it was
3828038 they are claiming i tried to unfurl a tibet banner i did not at any time try to unfurl a banner and i have never possessed any banner or protest material i was there simply to report on a demonstration not to take part in it in any way

3828055 i am surprised but not that surprised given the turmoil in the air force
3828056 it makes sense for new leadership to want to pause and evaluate major projects like cyber command before moving forward the air force is facing severe challenges right now so leadership may want to consolidate its resources before expanding the af cybermission

3828065 hey we dont know anything about this we dont understand this can you get together with us
3828066 ok i make ten bucks an hour i should be making twelve bucks an hour and i could be doing that with a union

3828068 this is a young couple who met after cynthias marriage had collapsed
3828069 i dont think shed had any contact with her ex husband for some time they fell in love and theyve had a baby together

3828071 he called and told me we can come home and i burst into tears its brilliant
3828072 this is a young couple who met after cynthias marriage had collapsed

3828076 this transaction will not affect our employees or the service we provide to more than seven million texas consumers
3828077 the draws are bullish across the board lower refinery output and lower imports led to the draws in the products for the past week
3828078 i think concerns over the georgian situation raised by president george w bush technical buy stops and the stock draws on oil and products are combining to push crude futures higher
3828079 we can produce fantastic dreams by hashish hallucinations of colour by anhalonium lewinii peyote we can even make him see stars by the use of a sandbag why then should we not be able to devise some pharmaceutical electrical or surgical method of inducing samadhi create genius as simply as we do other kinds of specific excitement
3828080 it should now be objected by the thoughtful that such criticism is purely destructive that all things are reduced thereby to a common unreality
3828081 agree conventionally that the relative and unreal ego has yet definite relations with the equally relative and unreal non ego and let us seek in terms of common sense a reason for rejecting the comparative reality value of the centaur for that of the cow
3828082 in fact it would be true to go much further and say few really simple things are appreciable directly even by a single sense he gives the examples of
3828083 when a man comes to us and speaks of being pursued by hypnotic suggestions by what right do we certify his as insane
3828084 it matters nothing to us whether what he sees or hears is in the philosophical sense real or imaginary
3828085 it is so wide so vague it obeys no law
3828086 it is true that the phenomena of nature are more varied and at first sight more unexpected

3828093 special awareness training for any pilot who flies under visual flight rules vfr within a 60 nautical mile nm radius of the washington dc dca vor dme
3828094 eaa and other general aviation organizations have voiced opposition to this mandatory training requirement
3828095 while we wish that this new requirement had not come along this final rule is the governments measured response to more than 3 000 adiz incursions that have occurred
3828096 like it or not the mandatory awareness training is the least onerous intervention the government can take on incursions
3828097 and if incursions continue after this training requirement has been in place for a while well have an even more difficult time opposing those who want to greatly increase restricted areas so its really up to us to become more vigilant about this
3828098 each time a serious adiz frz incursion prompts an evacuation in washington much of the hard work eaa and other organizations do to improve the perception of general aviation at the highest levels of government is obviated in a few minutes
3828099 general aviation makes more enemies in minutes than all the good contacts its representative organizations can build in years if we do not get adiz incursions under control ga will be irreparably harmed much more than it already has been
3828100 this is the safest period in aviation history due in large part to the cooperative effort between eaa and faa to protect innovation without sacrificing safety
3828101 we were pleased to pass an faa reauthorization bill with historic levels of funding that will support general aviation and that contains no user fees if we can just get the senate bill done and both versions into conference committee we can keep fighting for you on capitol hill
3828102 when it comes to airport upgrades we need more than just new equipment we need a new mandate and an improved framework to create a workable system for the future
3828103 some pilots and engineers are still making aircraft from scratch some of the most creative ideas and best technological advances in aviation come from the garages of these visionaries we need to find a way to protect the freedom to dream while keeping amateur built aircraft in the skies in the decades to come
3828104 i met a young woman today who went from flying with young eagles to working for a manufacturer building light sport aircraft and is working on her a amp p she is the future of aviation and eaa gave us that
3828105 while were not there yet alternative fuels and electric engines are out there on the horizon for us all we need is to find the right fuels in the right mix with the right aircraft at the right time
3828106 the small airfield where i keep my airplanes is having a harder and harder time getting fuel that we can use i find that im planning my trips around the places i know i can get gas we need to make sure ethanol blended fuel is clearly marked and that we keep the low lead and ethanol free fuel we need as widely available as possible
3828107 some manufacturers are treating the kit building process like a full service car wash they take the equipment from the owners and do the work while the amateur stands by the window at that point the owner shouldnt be able to say they built an airplane to protect the spirit behind the homebuilding rules we need to make sure its a hands on process for the amateur and that professional support and advising is limited to just that
3828108 unbalanced energy policy has skewed the entire big picture when it comes to fuel and aviation is certainly no exception there are innovative options out there whether its domestic oil production and refining or alternative fuel sources the only way to get back on track is to demand accountability from your leaders and make your voice heard

3828142 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3828143 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3828144 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3828145 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade

3828168 explicit biblical sic evidence for all the essential notions behind indulgences
3828169 these passages form the biblical sic basis for priestly absolution forgiveness and broadly speaking for both papal and church jurisdiction by extension for the power to impose penance binding retaining and to grant indulgences loosing forgiving
3828170 there is no discussion of priests performing the various binding loosing remitting retaining mentioned in the three passages
3828171 in entire agreement with the catholic tenets of penance and indulgences
3828172 acting as a type of papal figure in 2 corinthians 2 10
3828173 paul is to the corinthians as peter is to the other apostles
3828174 he forgives and bids the corinthian elders to forgive also even though the offense was not committed against them personally
3828175 clearly both parties are acting as gods representatives in the matter of the forgiveness of sins and the remission of sins temporal penalties an indulgence
3828176 in this as in all other doctrinal matters the catholic church is grounded in the bible takes seriously all that it teaches and grapples with all the implications and deepest wellsprings of truth to be found within the pages of gods holy scriptures

3828189 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
3828190 what we know is that if you see a very frail person next to somebody not so frail the very frail person is more likely to have alzheimers pathology in their brain when they die
3828191 this is important as we try to wrap our heads around the biology of aging
3828192 because it turns out that as you get older alzheimers pathology signs of its development are really ubiquitous even if that doesnt mean that you actually have dementia so this finding could alter the way most medical and non medical people conceptualize alzheimers as a disease simply of impaired memory and cognition while expanding our view of what it actually means to become frail
3828193 so now we put all this together and it raises the possibility that public health issue than previously thought if it turns out that being weak is a sign of its onset
3828194 but if so we also now have a clue as to how we can possibly intervene perhaps by treating motor dysfunction years before people develop dementia so that they wont develop dementia as early
3828195 this study really ties together two very common syndromes in aging cognitive processes and motor skills in ways i have not seen them connected before
3828196 so i think this is very important and relevant because it raises the question of whether frailty could be an early manifestation of

3828320 persons aged 15 44 years accounted for an estimated 41 2 percent of ed visits infants accounted for only an estimated 6 3 percent of ed visits
3828321 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events

3828346 although other factors such as type of food available and suitable shelter also play a role burmese pythons and other giant constrictor snakes have shown themselves to be highly adaptable to new environments
3828347 by using more complete climate data in this case 19 variables measuring climatic extremes averages and seasonal variation we can make more accurate predictions of species distributions
3828348 combining this climatic data with localities for the burmese python allows us to create powerful models for predicting suitable habitat for the snakes
3828349 the burmese python is strongly limited to the small area of suitable environmental conditions in the united states it currently inhabits due to the ecological niche preferences of the snake
3828350 global warming is predicted to significantly reduce the area of suitable habitat worldwide underscoring the potential negative effects of climate change for many species

3828656 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3828657 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3828658 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3828659 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3828661 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it

3828665 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption

3828671 hi beth i already linked some of those very blogs to my next installment
3828672 all the agents were happy about the issue because it gives us hope that other people will catch on and decide that its ok to use more black girls its ok to have more than just one and she doesnt have to always be naomi
3828673 i hate to sound cynical but by january i feel like it will be back to business as usual i want to be hopeful and positive but a part of me does not want to get my hopes up

3828680 cada vez que abrimos en la fiscal a una investigaci n imputamos dentro de nuestro deber y para darle una respuesta a la sociedad pues somos sujetos de contrademandas eso hace parte pues ya de la rutina
3828681 quienes son investigados judicializados lo primero que se les ocurre o mejor lo nico que se les ocurre es denunciarnos a la fiscales incluido el fiscal general

3828684 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan

3828689 foreclosures in a neighborhood affect the value of all homes in that neighborhood
3828690 therefore while the consumers facing foreclosure are directly affected by countrywides practices all homeowners are indirectly affected
3828691 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward
3828692 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
3828693 military and avionics systems such as mission computers navigation and guidance systems and stores management systems often have limited or no forced cooling requiring electronics with minimal heat dissipation and very low power consumption
3828694 our high density military temperature proasic3 and proasic3el devices give designers the increased logic they need for their sophisticated military and aerospace applications the combination of industry leading low power and high reliability provides an extremely desirable solution for these systems
3828695 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me
3828696 pardon him theodotus he is a barbarian and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature
3828697 and those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music
3828698 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
3828699 isnt he a lovely big boy im not sure who those people are but they send us the nicest pictures
3828700 isnt he a lovely big boy im not sure who those people are but they send us the nicest pictures
3828701 there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
3828702 the margins on cellphones are normally pretty healthy for retailers
3828703 but apple controls the iphone and it is a phone that people want to buy
3828704 i dont think they are going to try to do the bait and switch
3828705 and even if they were the customer that comes in asking for an iphone doesnt want the treo or the instinct they want the iphone so its an incremental sale for them
3828706 the entire angel flight world is saddened and surprised and shocked that this is happening all at once
3828707 is there any commonality its just so strange to have this happen after such a long history
3828708 the plane just did a nosedive straight down to the pavement
3828709 joe was a big volunteer in town he was somebody that understood the process of town government any time any of us had a question about how government worked he certainly had the answer most times
3828710 changes in consumer behavior have essentially erased five years of growth in gasoline demand
3828711 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3828712 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3828713 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3828714 while some are speculating about cyber warfare and state sponsorship we have no data to indicate anything of the sort at this time we are seeing some botnets some well known and some not so well known take aim at georgia websites these attacks were mostly tcp syn floods with one tcp rst flood in the mix no icmp or udp floods detected here these attacks were all globally sourced suggesting a botnet or multiple botnets were behind them
3828715 all of these are http floods ie rapid fire get requests
3828716 why have these new attacks been classified as incidents of cyberwarfare when so many attacks that came before them were not
3828717 refiners are cutting runs and imports plunged because demand is so weak
3828718 refiners werent making money so it made sense to shut units
3828719 so ericks like no way spacey your posts suck and shes like nuh uh
3828720 wait it gets better so then spacey posts something about national politics instead of local politics and ericks like dude that is so messed up and spaceys like no way and then erick totally
3828721 and then spaceys all mad and calls erick names and says he cant parent his children or something and then she says he totally mixes his metaphors and i think she took him off her top 8 friends at myspace and hes soooo totally not getting any more text messages from her
3828722 so then ericks like i had to do it cause youre screwing things up and then spacey goes all blah blah blah and then peach pundit goes down for scheduled maintenance or something for like a zillion hours last night
3828723 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3828724 frankly speaking once again i was surprised by the skills of the speechwriters who prepared the statement of the u s president
3828725 bushs speech said nothing of how georgia was armed all these years including by the united states
3828726 we have more than once warned our partners that this is a dangerous game
3828727 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3828728 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3828729 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional cease fire
3828730 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3828731 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3828732 i can tell you with all responsibility that there are no and cannot be any russian tanks in gori
3828733 the world seems to talk about cease fires while the worst kind of atrocities are being commited in my country
3828734 let the world finally wake up and take action and provide real security for the region
3828735 members have now had an opportunity to hear from their constituents and if they listen carefully i think theyll hear what i heard today a lot of americans from all walks of life wonder why we cant come together and get legislation necessary to end the ban on offshore drilling
3828736 the way ahead is this the moratorium on offshore drilling is included in the provisions of the us department of the interior appropriations bill when congress returns they should immediately bring this bill to the house floor and schedule an up or down vote on whether to lift the moratorium on offshore drilling
3828737 the democratic leadership should bring up a clean bill give the members a chance to vote up or down and not insert any legislative poison pills our goal should be to enact a law that reflects the will of the overwhelming majority of americans who want to open up oil resources on the outer continental shelf
3828738 but a part of solving the dilemma that hard working americans face the high price of gasoline is more exploration here in america and we can do it in a way that protects the environment
3828739 there is no way to separate the issue of energy from the issue of economy these issues are absolutely linked together so if were going to talk about a strong economy long term then we need to get a fix on reliable energy supplies
3828740 while manufacturers can raise productivity and manage costs for the inputs that go into products they cannot address structural costs of which energy is the biggest without strong leadership from elected officials
3828741 one of the things that came out in this discussion was theres a lot of folks in our country who understand we could be doing something about the high price of gasoline and were not obviously we need to be wise about conservation but weve got to be wise about increasing the supply of oil here in america if youre concerned about the price of gasoline one way to affect that is to increase oil supplies
3828742 i think it wasnt our day but the kids gave it 100 percent we just had two big falls we had to handle the chinese had an excellent day and they deserved to win
3828743 i think it wasnt our day but the kids gave it 100 percent we just had two big falls we had to handle the chinese had an excellent day and they deserved to win
3828744 the government has 100 control in wardak and the taleban are in a very poor condition in this province they do not have the support of the people
3828745 some of the incidents that took place on the highways are because we did not have enough afghan national police and there is misinformation against us
3828746 now the karzai government is building roads and bringing development unfortunately they cannot bring security
3828747 in my view this government is better than the taleban as there was no education economy or development
3828748 now the economy is good and children and going to school even girls the taleban were brutal and took power by force not democracy
3828749 security in itself is a challenge there are places where our de miners cannot go because of the security risk
3828750 its as close to kabul as logar and thats of a concern to us
3828751 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3828752 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3828753 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3828754 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3828755 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3828756 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3828757 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3828758 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3828759 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3828760 i was more or less sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take for 50 and i was hoping that i would be dead on
3828761 it was a best time but i was just disappointed
3828762 i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows the iraq war is largely about oil
3828763 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3828764 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3828765 part of the burden for elizabeth had been the lie
3828766 and thats why its so painful for her to see the father of her children become a pariah
3828767 increased alcohol outcomes among reserve guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance on these forces
3828768 active duty marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems
3828769 women were significantly more likely to start drinking heavily but less likely to start binge drinking or have alcohol related problems compared with men which may be due to women turning to drinking as a coping mechanism whereas men may have a higher propensity for risk taking behaviors
3828770 we are begging that president suleiman comes back from damascus with toufiq with him because hes an innocent man and his family is suffering
3828771 hes spent nearly a quarter century in prison and thats enough for any crime
3828772 we really want a positive relationship with syria and this is best achieved through the establishment of diplomatic relations the proper demarcation of our shared border and the resolution of all pressing issues including the question of lebanese persons still detained in syria
3828773 we are not saying all 17 000 are in syria but we know that there are a few hundred from the testimonies of family members and witnesses
3828774 i say to the families of those missing and those detained that he who has been patient for 30 years can wait a bit longer
3828775 the fans are crazy they know you everywhere you go
3828776 theres nowhere you can go in this city without being recognized
3828777 i couldnt believe that i felt like the pope for a minute i just play basketball
3828778 i do not see there is anything wrong with it
3828779 you have to be sure that the performers and the song it is at the highest level
3828780 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect
3828781 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3828782 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3828783 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3828784 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3828785 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3828786 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3828787 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3828788 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed
3828789 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3828790 il ny a gori ni maire ni structures de lordre seuls restent ses habitants qui manquent de vivres
3828791 jai eu un entretien t l phonique avec condoleezza rice la partie am ricaine a re u des informations selon lesquelles des formations arm es ill gales pilleraient la ville de gori et ses environs et que les forces arm es russes ne sy opposeraient pas

3828798 when interaction gets more natural computers can be everywhere to listen to you
3828799 even in a field like astronomy its not just looking through an eyepiece but testing theories and software lets you do that
3828800 mobile phones are increasingly becoming software driven platforms although they were just for voice before
3828801 as we get screens that can roll or fold out to be bigger or mobile devices that have small screens but can project larger images on walls that line between whats a pc and a mobile will keep getting grayer
3828802 software innovation will be pervasive it will happen to other things in our lives like our cars and our tvs
3828803 digital access is almost becoming like literacy children in poor countries need to get it too
3828804 iphone 2 0 is ready for the enterprise but caveats apply
3828805 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and browsing
3828806 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3828807 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3828808 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3828809 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3828810 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3828811 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3828812 accept the lowered overall security footprint that adoption will dictate or block the device from use
3828813 which could be an issue if the it organization hasnt verified what apple has delivered
3828814 we strongly suggest that enterprises use existing management tools to modify the itunes registry entries to disable firmware updates file transfers and other activities that could inject unwanted content into the enterprise as well as to lock down the registry
3828815 eliminate itunes as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device as microsoft and rim have done
3828816 although we cannot confirm what is causing the battery life to be so short we believe it to be apples implementation of exchange activesync and or wi fi
3828817 apple has delivered an iphone that is acceptable for business use at the appliance level most prospective iphone users will judge the device based on consumer appeal the app store applications and the iphones excellent browser are supplemented with an e mail client which provides acceptable business capability with excellence in some areas
3828818 those who previously used a blackberry windows mobile or nokia smart phone device should note that the iphone will require an assessment of trade offs in hardware design and onboard functionality however each enterprise will view iphone through its own lens which will be heavily tinted by the organizations security and management needs enterprises should approach expanded use of the iphone slowly and with close examination
3828819 suddenly find myself almost able to forgive blizzard for the fail murloc
3828820 how would you like an extra 500 1000 a week with 15 minutes of your time
3828821 where you innovate how you innovate and what you innovate are design problems
3828822 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3828823 oh dif cil demais eles nunca v o chegar ao topo
3828824 eles n o tem nenhuma chance de subirem a torre muito alta
3828825 we got a container and chased it around the bottom of a crate for a while
3828826 were going to comply with this order and this business will eventually go away
3828827 there is no other story behind this that will be reported next week this is the full story
3828828 i want whats good for everybody not just whats good for me whos the best for the nation right now

3828832 lets pollute the air for humans too while we kill off all the animals
3828833 if approved the changes would represent the biggest overhaul of the endangered species act since 1988 they would accomplish through regulations what conservative republicans have been unable to achieve in congress ending some environmental reviews that developers and other federal agencies blame for delays and cost increases on many projects
3828834 the administration also tried to jettison the entire rule outright a gambit that was struck down in court though legal action continues more recently bush appointees have worked on rescinding the rule one state at a time it has launched rollback processes in idaho and colorado two states with more than 13 million roadless areas between them in each state they are pursuing phony replacement rules shot full of loopholes that would jeopardize millions and millions of wildland acres vigorous public support across the country for the original strong rule will be essential in beating back these state specific rollbacks
3828835 although scd is very rare it robs us of seemingly healthy young people with their whole lives ahead of them the loss of each of these lives is a tragedy
3828836 many professional athletes can be screened by their sporting bodies indeed professional footballers in the spl already have checks every year
3828837 but until now there has been no opportunity for young scots who participate in organised amateur sports to have access to appropriate testing
3828838 the launch today of this pilot means that young scots will soon be able to take part in sport with a greater degree of safety than in the past and help avoid the tragedy of further preventable deaths
3828839 warfarin sometimes masquerades as diazepam 10mg for someone who doesnt need warfarin it could be fatal as you could bleed to death
3828840 my plea is to anyone who feels they want these medicines do not buy them from illegal sources its much too dangerous
3828841 as many people on these tablets now as there were during the troubles
3828842 were buying blue tablets on the street with no identification or markings on them they assumed it was diazepam 10mg but they could have been given anything
3828843 no one knows for sure whats in the tablets unless theyre clinically tested
3828844 this can be a difficult group of patients what we dont want are those patients disappearing and buying them on the black market
3828845 the new software which significantly upgrades performance of our embedded memory solutions is expected to make onenand and other high performance high density memory solutions such as the 16gb movinand even more desirable for advanced handsets speeding the adoption rate of samsungs embedded memory solutions
3828846 approval of verizons video franchise is great news for the residents of woodinville who will soon have more choice for their video entertainment
3828847 we commend the mayor city council and city staff for their dedication and hard work throughout this process
3828848 we look forward to reaching similar agreements with other washington communities
3828849 the 4870 x2 is more than a match for a single nvidia gtx 280 and depending on the title sometimes a match for two gtx 280s
3828850 drivers are now atis only weak area so the 4870 x2s performance and scaling with two 4870 x2s quadfire often varies widely from title to title
3828851 joe has great material and its going to be spectacular be we just couldnt find a time when we could both work
3828852 thread here is my dual test and its very close i think you have the same file but if not here it is
3828853 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3828854 i was cold cocked on the left side of my face by at least one if not three hells angels
3828855 i tried to wriggle free but didnt have any leverage
3828856 i then pulled the handgun from my hip and opened fire
3828857 estoy muy cabreada con lo del sueldo de tori yo estoy enfadada porque yo adoro a tori y estaba encantada con el hecho de estar con ella en la serie

3828871 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3828872 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3828873 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
3828874 this is much bigger than any other place where there is america influence and this is the most natural allies of america
3828875 who else can stand up for liberty in the world
3828876 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
3828877 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
3828878 la invasi n rusa de georgia pone en peligro el acceso a la iss

3828882 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3828883 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3828884 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3828885 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3828886 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3828887 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3828888 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3828889 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3828890 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3828891 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3828892 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3828893 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3828894 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3828895 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3828896 great i need to learn how to use another tool

3828902 health care providers including ambulance companies have a vital obligation to their customers taking advantage of vulnerable new yorkers by extracting excessive and undue payments is a massive insult to injury my health care bureau works to ensure that hard working consumers are not subjected to erroneous and illegal overbilling by companies like greenport

3828904 dia sedar bahawa dia manusia biasa dia masih punya allah yang mengatur hidupnya yang aku tahu dia akan selalu berusaha tapi dia tidak menjanjikan apa apa soalnya dia tidak tahu apa yang akan terjadi pada kami kemudian hari entah kenapa justru itu memberikan kesenangan tersendiri buat aku

3828907 they have continued to do what i believe to be harassing and discriminatory behavior retaliatory behavior the administration is appointed by the mayor and they are very arrogant they do what they want and what theyre doing is illegal

3828909 vi prego qualcuno mi dica che solo una panzana giornalistica
3828910 what pleases me even more than the money is that this is effectively a public apology
3828911 a lot of wild figures have been bandied about but what i wanted more than money was for people in the street to realise they got it wrong about me
3828912 i would like to buy my council flat where ive lived for over 30 years and i want to put in a new bathroom and kitchen and make a few changes in the garden and of course make sure ive got food on my table and my bills paid
3828913 the best thing is being able to get off the dole im a proud man who has never been afraid of work but nobody in the countless interviews ive attended has wanted to take me on
3828914 im now slowly realising that i have a future after all and thats a great feeling
3828915 our members in johnston press want to produce high quality local papers but they are finding they have to work incredibly long hours sometimes dangerously long hours in order to do so
3828916 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3828917 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3828918 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3828919 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3828920 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3828921 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3828922 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3828923 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3828924 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3828925 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers
3828926 believes that uk historical ad spending rises cannot be sustained as advertisers pull away from decaying circulation which has fallen by 33 in the past 20 years compared with a 19 fall in the us
3828927 cautioned that uk newspaper stocks which have fallen by 40 since the start of the year compared with us papers down by 48 could fall farther
3828928 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3828929 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3828930 the send off was harsh even some world governing body fifa officials said it was a yellow card at best
3828931 some of the reds have been mighty harsh at least theyre consistent but it doesnt make it easier to take
3828932 the refereeing last night was a bit inconsistent he let some things go and pulled us up on others whether they think because were a lesser nation were not au fait with the rules
3828933 but thats the game and youve got to deal with it and get on and play
3828934 putting everything in the pot weve done pretty well especially playing 1 1 2 games with 10 men
3828935 actually making the final this time arounds going to be a lot tougher than any other olympics i think the automatic qualifying standard is going to be around 63 metres id be surprised if its anything less
3828936 the thing thats exciting for me is that now i have a lifting coach and a biomechanics coach everythings covered whereas before it was a different situation with one person trying to look after everything
3828937 its a different situation to be in because when things dont go well you dont have a back up plan you dont have other people you can seek advice from
3828938 we set up a couple of competitions but i was left with only myself and one other competitor its hard to set up a situation like the olympics where you have 20 25 in your pool
3828939 im here at the olympics its my fourth one and theres the potential of attending my fifth especially with the team ive got now
3828940 its an emotional moment because swimming has been my life
3828941 setting up business strategy and cascading it thats epm understanding risk thats grc governance risk and compliance and analysis of what works that is bi
3828942 there are use cases we are looking at supporting some are working today dashboard builder for example lets you lasso crystal reports content and drag and drop it into a dashboard you can add xcelsius components and even web intelligence docs
3828943 going forward we are looking at things like moving a web intelligence query into voyager for slicing and dicing work sets from polestar into web intelligence for someone else other then the casual information user to then create scheduled reports for publishing et cetera
3828944 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3828945 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3828946 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3828947 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3828948 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3828949 we believe that standard chartered needs to strengthen its equity tier 1 ratio from the current level of 6 1 per cent which puts it close to the bottom versus 70 asian banks under coverage
3828950 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage
3828951 will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3828952 worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3828953 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3828954 weakening consumer spending will likely hurt all ad categories in 2008 we think 2009 may be just as bad if not worse
3828955 relative upside at the other end of this tunnel with regional newspapers retaining local higher priced advertising
3828956 our view is that micro focus is very well attuned to the current economic climate anticipating that the market and operational commentary should remain positive we retain our buy
3828957 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website
3828958 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3828959 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3828960 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3828961 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3828962 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3828963 the ferag finishing lines we have acquired recently give us the opportunity to relocate finishing from greaves to our other print sites thereby improving efficiency and reducing transportation
3828964 this closure represented another hammer blow to the print and packaging industry which is already reeling from the closures of curtis and beith and the announced job cuts at sappi and johnston press
3828965 which would you prefer a reduction to previous levels of power supplies or some form of manpower system based on employing more full time staff but flexed on some form of average hours basis which would you choose
3828966 if the business mix shift towards wholesale banking continues we believe the underlying profitability of the group will be undermined particularly if the benign credit conditions deteriorate as asian economic growth slows
3828967 one of the least likely to need a rights issue or face financial distress
3828968 it is clear that the adverse market conditions affecting the residential sector will continue for some time to come
3828969 in light of the current market conditions we intend to reduce the running rate of our overhead costs by 10pc by the end of this financial year
3828970 despite the challenging trading market our unique portfolio is showing relatively good liquidity
3828971 it needs to continue to reduce debt levels to protect it against a more dramatic downturn in the uk residential market than we predict and afford it the headroom to expand through acquisitions once market conditions are right to do so
3828972 well heres why poppy spam seems to be the only page used on my entire site and id like the other pages to be used for once
3828973 the more logs a child has the more things can be built
3828974 it is the intent of the legislature to develop and implement interagency strategies in service training programs and activities that will improve school attendance and reduce school crime and violence including vandalism hate crimes bullying including acts bullying committed personally or by means of an electronic act
3828975 authorize school officials to suspend or recommend for expulsion pupils who engage in bullying including but not limited to bullying by means of an electronic act as defined
3828976 the transmission of a communication including but not limited to a message text sound or image by means of an electronic device including but not limited to a telephone wireless telephone or other wireless communication device computer or pager
3828977 there are probably enough lonmin shareholders who want to sell out and invest in other mining plays the rejection does not mean that we wont see a takeover
3828978 we see the bid as opportunistic synergy driven and likely to succeed
3828979 we see very little chance of a counter bid and it is a case of who blinks first between xstrata and the lonmin shareholders
3828980 lonmin shareholders are rightly fed up with incumbent management and we feel they will definitely not back a go it alone strategy and will want to lose this offer
3828981 when managements are this unloved platinum group metals prices are weak and interloper risk is low xstrata have a fair chance of taking this home at the offer price
3828982 we believe there is a good chance that johnston press will announce a specific costs target or signal a significant exercise is under way to improve efficiency
3828983 though there was no particular evidence that the tire gauge attack was having an effect the mccain campaigns glee was evident
3828984 yes i know i am not supposed to mention his middle name but i am going to anyway
3828985 loser taker all election fraud and the subversion of democracy 2000 2008

3828991 this is a wonderful fun filled fund raising event for the miss new hampshire scholarship fund the mount washington cruise lines have remained a valued sponsor for us
3828992 finally ive been waiting to take lessons for years lets get going
3828993 hemos visto que entre la inversi n reciente alguna de ella ya confirmada hablamos de un monto superior a los 3 mil millones de d lares calculados en ese momento diciembre 2007 pero es una cifra similar a la que se maneja hoy por el tipo de cambio lo cual nos alegra mucho
3828994 tradicionalmente piura tambi n ha tenido y tiene nuevas inversiones en los campos minero no met lico y petrolero as como gas fero
3828995 por las caracter sticas de la inversi n se focaliza a n m s en localidades agroindustriales energ ticas y no met licos y tambi n hay una inversi n en los valles por razones de requerimiento de infraestructura como en sechura y sullana
3828996 las nacionales se focalizan en medianas o peque as empresas del sector agroindustrial mientras que en energ a o minas est n los grandes empresarios
3828997 das ist meine art des jakobsweg zu gehen bzw zu segeln

3829000 let me offer you the worlds most comfortable electric chair or gas chamber
3829001 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
3829002 your father my son i love him more than anything in the world but hes a god damn republican
3829003 behold the wholly sanitized childhood without skinned knees or the occasional c in history kids need to learn that you need to feel bad sometimes we learn through experience and we learn especially through bad experiences through disappointment and failure we learn how to cope
3829004 ive figured out that if it ever looks like theres going to be trouble on the subway i act like im a little bit crazy and no one goes near me okay
3829005 fans of crysis are going to enjoy more of the open ended gameplay cutting edge visuals and huge epic battles from the first game
3829006 while also finally finding out what kind of havoc psycho was wreaking on the other side of the island
3829007 when interaction gets more natural computers can be everywhere to listen to you
3829008 even in a field like astronomy its not just looking through an eyepiece but testing theories and software lets you do that
3829009 mobile phones are increasingly becoming software driven platforms although they were just for voice before
3829010 as we get screens that can roll or fold out to be bigger or mobile devices that have small screens but can project larger images on walls that line between whats a pc and a mobile will keep getting grayer
3829011 software innovation will be pervasive it will happen to other things in our lives like our cars and our tvs
3829012 lots of computing capacity and storage and at low cost
3829013 these poll results demonstrate that parents are as apprehensive about their childrens media diets as they are about traditional social issues such as alcohol drugs violence and sex
3829014 iphone 2 0 is ready for the enterprise but caveats apply
3829015 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and browsing
3829016 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3829017 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3829018 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3829019 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3829020 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3829021 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3829022 accept the lowered overall security footprint that adoption will dictate or block the device from use
3829023 which could be an issue if the it organization hasnt verified what apple has delivered
3829024 we strongly suggest that enterprises use existing management tools to modify the itunes registry entries to disable firmware updates file transfers and other activities that could inject unwanted content into the enterprise as well as to lock down the registry
3829025 eliminate itunes as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device as microsoft and rim have done
3829026 although we cannot confirm what is causing the battery life to be so short we believe it to be apples implementation of exchange activesync and or wi fi
3829027 apple has delivered an iphone that is acceptable for business use at the appliance level most prospective iphone users will judge the device based on consumer appeal the app store applications and the iphones excellent browser are supplemented with an e mail client which provides acceptable business capability with excellence in some areas
3829028 um fil sofo um homem que experimenta v ouve suspeita espera e sonha constantemente coisas extraordin rias que atingido pelos pr prios pensamentos como se eles viessem de fora de cima e de baixo como por uma esp cie de acontecimentos e de fa scas de que s ele pode ser alvo que talvez ele pr prio uma trovoada prenhe de rel mpagos novos um homem fatal em torno do qual sempre ribomba e rola e rebenta e se passam coisas inquietantes
3829029 the green element seems to be more important in the lower to mid priced homes as that is what i am getting the most requests for and there is very little inventory in the lower price ranges i believe the upper range people either add their own green elements to existing homes or are not as concerned
3829030 you know its a bottom when they stop calling a bottom
3829031 to get more insight into the difficulties in these various
3829032 theyre great for their intended uses but theyre not for everyone
3829033 if an independent software vendor discovers that they have shipped a vulnerable activex control they should e mail us to work with microsoft to issue a kill bit disabling that control
3829034 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
3829035 they said many times that they are working as a coalition to better secure the windows operating system and everything which runs on it
3829036 while microsoft has issued a few kill bits in the past for third party products this is something we are going to continue to see going forward
3829037 so any reduction in outlook might be viewed as disappointing
3829038 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3829039 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3829040 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3829041 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3829042 because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3829043 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3829044 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3829045 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else
3829046 whats your opinion on all the recent superhero sex changes going on like kraven loki and ms sinister
3829047 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
3829048 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
3829049 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
3829050 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
3829051 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
3829052 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
3829053 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
3829054 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
3829055 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration
3829056 distilling subject concepts from opencyc vol b1 overview and methodology
3829057 under our expanded charter announced last year we are branching out in new directions such as power consumption while continuing to move ahead with our graphics and workstation application benchmarks
3829058 this keeps building on the nets evolution processing peoples usage and behavior but to do that at a massive scale you have an intelligence system this is an area evolving in many different ways with a number of different companies and verticals
3829059 everyone talks about all the data thats being created and how valuable it is but the way you make it available is by doing something actionable with it
3829060 we are really fascinated with data and the ability to use it to increase effective cost per thousand for ads theres this explosion of inventory but people havent figured out how to monetize it yet data will be the difference
3829061 on the verge of exploding in the next two years
3829062 the iphone introduction has begun to cause a shakeup that is long overdue in mobileland
3829063 theres opportunity in the space between web apis and raw cloud computing
3829064 soon all youre going to need is a terminal and net connection but until then there are opportunities to build up file systems system admin services and other things we can do with web apis
3829065 this is a big deal its a real honor for the whole country theres an amazing energy in china for this event
3829066 i think what was really nice was that the mayor placed my segment on top of the ancient wall and then i came down the stairs
3829067 having the chance to be on the wall and identify with the heritage and everything else was really nice
3829068 it couldnt be better than to have your kids screaming and taking pictures
3829069 i didnt find out until they sent me a letter asking for my shoe size and shirt size
3829070 and then the list was published on the internet by each olympic committee and thats when i saw my name and it was the only foreign name on there
3829071 these sites are being destroyed left and right especially in asia where theres been a lot of growth so they just wipe them out
3829072 a lot of them just dont realize that their grandkids could be making thousands of dollars on this type of thing
3829073 if you take advantage of one of these sites and develop it responsibly youre going to be bringing thousands of people out of poverty
3829074 we try to set up a financial trust thats sustainable and more money keeps going into it to keep things going
3829075 its a coal mining region in china it had a wall around it and it was a poor place in the middle of nowhere
3829076 they come in on a bus and they leave they maybe eat and throw away their garbage and go to the restroom that costs money for the town this region is getting destroyed
3829077 were trying to get the local business people to be the owners of the site we fund capacity building training and planning and help them on initial conservation work
3829078 local people really give us the fuel to accomplish the mission and do 12 projects at the same time
3829079 i think heritage conservation is fairly new on an international level some smaller people have been doing it for a while but in terms of peoples minds its pretty new
3829080 we really want to i think emphasize the importance of these sites in the world and in the big picture
3829081 also the sites are nonrenewable a forest can grow back but sites cant once theyre gone theyre gone forever and were losing them on our watch right now

3829092 the concept of chivalry brings a bit of romance even if youve seen it a hundred times in a knights tale until you can actually hear the horses smell the sweaty leather and see the speed at which it breaks that turns it into a 3 d event
3829093 many of us in the technology community have done a poor job of communicating to the general public why they should care about these issues with geekpac we hope to change that by driving thought leadership in this area and building a critical mass of concerned citizens who will be able to get the attention of their local politicians

3829099 this is because of the commonly recognized importance of semantic metadata in effectively supporting various media related activities such as intelligent search and retrieval of media assets web
3829100 the impact of technology upon metadata collection costs courvoisier or cold duck
3829101 this paper focuses on the impact of technology on the cost of metadata
3829102 we compare these costs within representative media and entertainment workflows when using either traditional or modern file based technologies projections regarding the ongoing impact of technology upon metadata costs will also be examined
3829103 until best practices emerge this area will be subject to significant upheaval and innovation
3829104 is there room for standardization here will these technologies be applicable to other areas this papers purpose is to provide clarity to this important and evolving issue

3829108 the us patent and trademark office may have a major problem on its hands the possibly unconstitutional appointment of nearly two thirds of its patent appeals judges such a constitutional flaw if legitimate could call into question the hundreds of decisions worth billions of dollars in the past eight years the flaw discovered by highly regarded intellectual property scholar john duffy of george washington university law school could also afflict the appointment of nearly half of the agencys trademark appeals judges

3829110 normally i dont bother to get multi platform games on the mobile instead of the console unless i dont have the console that the better version is out on for instance i bought the psp version of
3829111 there are rare exceptions to the rule however star wars unleashed is an instant purchase for me on the wii but considering how much time i spend on my new iphone 3g and how much dust my psp and ds have collected since the iphone 3gs launch im going to be buying two versions of the same game for the first time in my life iphone and wii at least both versions have drastically different types of control so it probably wont feel like a waste to buy two versions of the same title
3829112 yes for my psp i dont actually buy any multi platform games for my ps2 pc since i have my psp mostly because i like games on the go often the quality is lower thats true but i forgive a lot if the portable version is at least playable
3829113 to be honest i dont really think about whether a game is multi platform or not when i am considering buying a game i ask some friends about it read some reviews and then search youtube for videos of the gameplay if that all checks out ill buy it
3829114 to be honest when it comes to the psp at least i stick to exclusive titles though im sure id enjoy lots of the third party multi platform games out there i just cant bring myself to play a pared down version of something once ive experienced the showroom build
3829115 when it comes to that necessary gaming junk food i e mostly all of eas multi platform output i want a gallon of coke and a skip full of fries with that burger a happy meal just wont cut it if you get my meaning
3829116 i often buy the ds version of multi platform games mostly because the line isnt so clear with that console the hardware necessitates a completely different approach and games ultimately bear little relevance to the showroom builds as you put it accelorata for example with the forthcoming
3829117 i get your point on psp though often the titles come across like pale imitations as opposed to a thoughtful sidestep to the under the console tv version i think
3829118 hey maybe this is a star wars thing i should probably make a poor joke now about the force being strong weak with this one or something but i just cant be arsed
3829119 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
3829120 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
3829121 beating a dead horse through overuse of a tired old joke

3829126 the report showed the child had fallen from a tykes picnic table
3829127 i know that children services is looking into that im not sure whether there is a history there or not
3829128 you know kids holler and play but i never saw anything like that the children looked fine i mean they didnt have any injuries or anything like that
3829129 anytime you have a child involved its heartbreaking its sickening to see that a 2 year old has these kinds of injuries

3829131 take back our highways is clearly working to save lives it has gotten real results there are people alive today because of this intensive highway safety effort we want the people of alabama to understand that when they travel their safety is our number one concern
3829132 we have saved more than 150 lives in the last 18 months because of the work of our state troopers with innovative programs like take back our highways we are making a difference for alabama
3829133 too many alabamians die or are seriously injured on our roadways in preventable crashes
3829134 too many motorists are the victims of drunken drivers and fully two thirds of the fatality victims troopers have responded to this year were not using seat belts
3829135 we will have troopers from every rank and every division including driver license and abi in uniform and on the road aug 18 25

3829137 adolescence is when we can develop a stronger sense of who we are and of who we want to be but that only happens when a teen feels confident enough to explore and try new things in a healthy way
3829138 too often tv the movies and commercials give girls the idea that anything less than the perfect standard of being a 10 is falling short
3829139 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3829140 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3829141 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3829142 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3829143 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3829144 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3829145 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3829146 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on
3829147 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on
3829148 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3829149 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3829150 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3829151 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose
3829152 what participation i have had no participation in boldrin and levines book whatsoever

3829170 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias taxpayers and this years budget process but the states leaders have failed to act

3829477 one component of the drag comes from the fact that if the body is moving on the surface it creates waves
3829478 those waves actually create an extra component of drag so if you can move underwater instead of on the surface of the water you can actually eliminate this component of drag
3829479 our simulations and animations have shown that almost 90 percent of all the thrust the propulsion for the swimmers is coming from the part of the foot beyond the ankle
3829480 whatever youre thinking about is literally like planning a future event when youre worrying you are planning when you are appreciating you are planning what are you planning
3829481 he was in town to meet with north island mp catherine bell and discuss issues affecting her constituency
3829482 i see him all the time at least once a week
3829483 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3829484 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3829485 the reason we went from 6 to uh wait i cant seem to find us in the rankings anywhere is because we uh just wait till next year
3829486 during the cincinnati concert corabi didnt look all that happy to be there and didnt seem to share in the energy that the rest of the band had but he was still there
3829487 the price they are paying is probably a pretty full one but people would be able to extract quite a few synergies
3829488 this is a highly accretive transaction though there are some execution issues
3829489 the rationale for the deal is that csls operating margins are much better and they can take that business and drive up towards their margin
3829490 in a revenue sense certainly 10 percent is not an unreasonable assumption with our current information
3829491 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3829492 they breached the agreement they occupied territory that belongs to zugdidi district
3829493 the people of gamukhuri are in a panic and they are leaving under very heavy psychological pressure from the other side
3829494 a few very important buildings were occupied by the russians
3829495 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3829496 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3829497 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
3829498 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3829499 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3829500 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3829501 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3829502 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3829503 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama
3829504 they have a bit of a weathermans track record when it comes to forecasting
3829505 it would protect the u s from supply shocks elsewhere and its probably the best stimulus we could come up with
3829506 youre talking about a million barrels day coming online the additional supply is a big deal
3829507 no one knows what impact its going to have 10 years down the road but were still going to need more oil and gas
3829508 were not talking about alternatives because we both support alternatives
3829509 the republicans think theyve identified an issue they can win on
3829510 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3829511 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3829512 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3829513 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3829514 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3829515 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3829516 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3829517 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3829518 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3829519 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3829520 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3829521 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well

3829548 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini and shamala revisited
3829549 really cause such confusion amongst our ministers amongst the umno pas and pkr leaders and amongst the self proclaimed muslim student leaders
3829550 we recognise and respect article 121 1a however there is a strong viewpoint that it is unjust to compel anyone to be subjected to laws and courts that are based on a religion that they do not profess and this viewpoint must be addressed although open to everyone ragunath said they were taking the necessary precautions to ensure that the dialogue took place in a controlled and constructive manner by holding it in a closed setting and by requiring participants to register for the event per se as the bar council endorses the absolute right of individuals to embrace islam instead the forum will address the ancillary issues that arise from such situations and will emphasise the need for laws and a judicial system that protects everyone equally
3829551 i represent umno stop this forum dont insult islam you chinese indians go to hell
3829552 you are wakil umno saya wakil orang islam sebagai orang islam kita mesti bertindak dengan cara yang baik
3829553 the world aint all sunshine and rainbows it is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it aint bout how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take and keep moving forward thats how winning is done now if you know what youre worth then go out and get what youre worth but you gotta be willing to take the hit and not pointing fingers saying you aint where you are because of him or her or anybody cowards do that and that aint you youre better than that
3829554 as usurpation is the exercise of power which another hath a right to so tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right which nobody can have a right to
3829555 us presidential runoff john mccain said that russia should not interfere in the conflict in south ossetia the pro georgian propaganda in the us media testifies to the same opinion it brings up the idea that the georgian aggression against the unrecognized republic of south ossetia has been coordinated with the us administration
3829556 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
3829557 youve then got somebody coming around to a commander handing him a bag of 25 000 cash and saying to go rebuild iraq
3829558 a rifle only gets you so far cerp allows you to develop our answer to al qaida
3829559 would use of funds embarrass the defense department if shown on 60 minutes
3829560 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
3829561 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
3829562 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
3829563 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
3829564 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
3829565 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3829566 responsible financial institutions and businesses worldwide are taking steps to avoid doing business with iranian nuclear and missile entities as well as with the front companies and cut outs the iranian regime uses to disguise its activities
3829567 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
3829568 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3829569 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
3829570 the issue with iran is not about uranium enrichment it wants to control the region
3829571 the reason for this is that they do not want people to panic
3829572 if there is a nuclear leak from one of irans nuclear reactors we need to have stockpiled iodine
3829573 kuwait must have emergency medical teams ready to deal with such situations who are equipped with supplies ready in all areas of kuwait who are ready to deal with every contingency
3829574 stockpile food and have alternative routes to import food into kuwait
3829575 kuwait would need to procure more trucks for this purpose
3829576 this would require oil tankers equipped to travel in shallow water during the tanker war this was done and proved to be very expensive
3829577 it was successful to maintain the flow of kuwaiti oil but expensive
3829578 powerful forces have historically attempted to control trade via this point
3829579 so they could control traffic through the gulf iran has had this intention since 1971
3829580 the maneuvers that have been carried out recently are held one after another to keep our armed forces prepared and strong fortunately these exercises have shown our great defensive capabilities to the world
3829581 security is a national issue the people expect our courageous armed forces to take even the slightest threats seriously
3829582 what we are talking about here are threats from outside the region
3829583 to all my arab brothers and sisters in neighboring countries i must say that our security is your security and your security is ours
3829584 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3829585 reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary
3829586 would give iran international legitimacy for its programme which it currently lacks
3829587 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3829588 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the
3829589 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3829590 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3829591 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3829592 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3829593 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3829594 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3829595 we have a contract with them that says they will pay anything over 135 million the costs in the condemnation case are over that amount
3829596 its not our debt thats the position we have taken and thats consistent with what the master agreement says
3829597 i think when it is all said and done i will have made more money than i ever dreamed i would make
3829598 when all those people in austin say he aint never done anything well this is it
3829599 in this particular situation our first offer should be our final offer if this fails we will probably have to initiate condemnation proceedings after the bond election passes
3829600 i understand full well the value of private property and its importance not only in our state but in capitalism in general and i will do everything i can to defend the power of private property and private property rights when i am the governor of this state
3829601 the best way to allocate resources in our society is through the marketplace not through a governing elite

3829604 any time there is a fat person onstage as anything besides the butt of a joke its political
3829605 today we are going to get as mad as hell and express it
3829606 did everyone do their home work of crying over a loss and what was it and what happened and how did you feel that is the kind of world i want to live in an open feelings are real and accepted and honored and celebrated world
3829607 here we go i hope to god we make it through this f amp king day

3829610 im not getting on him im just talking about what he can improve no 2 blocking balls no 3 continue working on his throwing no 4 understanding catching is most important all of it together is a process it takes time its called experience
3829611 because you cant be caught red handed if youre not red handed darling i would never say those words to you i was pulling out my heart so i could pin it to my sleeve on display for you to see im on display

3829617 n o obstante as quest es morais e legais eu combinei extracontratualmente com a dione que ela tentar ressarcir todos os professores das suas d vidas come ando pelos brasileiros nossos convidados neste processo
3829618 verdade que se eu pudesse assumiria o pagamento a toda a gente da totalidade das d vidas que o unib deixou embora se o fizesse a minha prioridade seria certamente a universidade da madeira que se viu obrigada a romper com essa empresa por incumprimento

3829644 and please dont even let me go into how dropping by my favorite blogs spots and websites while procrastinating could probably force out those tears that i have been successfully forcing back all morning out of creative inspiration and lust that will only get locked up with the rest of the magic or out of sheer frustration and jealousy about all of the domestic flow charisma and acceptance that some of these ladies seem to embody it is enough to just make me want to lump up and cry after all i would prefer that to the cleaning

3829654 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not between one candidate whos a talker and the other candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president

3829662 what would you be doing today if you only had 37 days to live
3829663 four months ago a stabbing pain in my pelvis had me down on the floor of the bathroom as if someone tried to pull all my insides out of me and the body was resisting my mind asked is this the end then i fainted several hours later my gynecologist was telling me about a strange ovarian formation that he would have to follow closely i whispered what does that mean he saw three possibilities ectopic pregnancy ovarian cancer or strangely structured but rather frequent cyst for my perimenopausal age that would if i am lucky disappear on its own or if it grows require surgery but dont worry nowadays we use laparoscopy much more comfortable for you blah blah if the pain comes back do not hesitate to call ovarian cancer is quickly spreading so to avoid any risk i will see you in two weeks in the meantime i would like to have these tumor markers levels and to check your pregnancy hormones and strange how a life promise and a life ending were on equal foot in his sentence two weeks my chewing gum legs somehow managed to get me out of his office was this the beginning of the count down i stood at the bus stop waiting for death to be sitting on that very bus and called my boss to tell her my translation would be a little late take your time she said the bus was crowded taking me back home a road i know by heart i squeezed myself next to the small square window and watched belgrade move by the people the cars the buildings the trees the tired sunshine over the river all looked hazy and distant where am i where is home where do i belong where is this bus taking me it took me to a place i had always been avoiding the sea of no control the first time i visited it during the 1999 bombing i felt like a helpless peg in a game knowing from the beginning that i belonged to the loser team i spent the first two nights in our cave sitting on my sleeping bag holding my daughters head in my lap hearing crushing and rumbling in the distance waiting for our turn and listening to the neighbourhood women recount all the terrifying memories they could remember i decided id rather die playing cards with my kid under the kitchen table than listen to them again we were no longer going down there instead i called my colleagues and i continued to work i was working for a french humanitarian organisation and there were lives we could save the french were evacuated the office was closed down for security reasons but we the local staff were here when going to humanitarian aid coordination meetings downtown i took my daughter with me so if they bombed the bridge we would be on the same river bank she stayed in the office next door learning computer games all adversities have a positive side you just have to find it so what was my lesson now waiting always felt like a punishment a void impossible to fill you cannot start anything since what you are waiting for is taking up all your brain i was waiting for a verdict my grand mother died of cancer my cousin is fighting breast cancer my aunt in croatia has melanoma my mother and my sister had hysterectomies when they were my age every night a cloud of nothingness descended into my bed and spread over my tired body i hopelessly turned and tossed trying to shake it off clinging to all the wisdom tips and survival tricks i had collected on my road my resilience values my psycho social training the non violent communication recipes my disability how to list the verses i liked the meditation instructions the let go of stress points only to toss around more and to see morning light on my crumpled sheets while i once again had to admit defeat i spent my days like a zombie all i could do was prepare an often insipid meal fill and empty the laundry machine then i gave up next night i imagined a different life all my possessions given away including the hammock from my waking life i took only what matters the night giggles with my daughter the fuming morning tea bowls with my husband our rare but precious family laughters the walks by the danube with my father my clay wednesdays my qi gong class pals my delight at connecting people my oh so rare early morning swims and then it happened i could be swimming every morning i could have no more translation deadlines no more stuff i could freely spend my savings i could move to my friends house at the sea and organize retreats with nada the freelancer yes ive had my share of how to live with challenge seminars perhaps its time i start sharing the next echography showed it had shrunk a bit the lab results were not saying much in the meantime i had read all there is on the net on ovarian cancer and packed everything for my trip to the coast so when the doctor said the next check up would be in a month i only found it normal i went to the sea and swam every morning and scribbled down all my ideas for a recall your creativity workshop the next check up totally disappointed my gynecologist no trace of it nothing to operate
3829664 things that are better here than there category and vice versa
3829665 ive attached a poem i wrote this morning in which i try to grapple a little with the idea of what im trying to achieve in my life as a person as a daughter as a lawyer working to protect and uphold the rights of all who live in south africa found in our awe inspiring constitution in winter in johannesburg the air is dry and the sunsets are my reason for making sure i leave work to catch the moment when an otherwise ugly city suddenly turns into a seething mass of pink pink light everywhere it is fast and fleeting and i love it yesterday driving home i tried to savour every moment of it even though i was stuck in traffic and it gave me the start of my poem thanks for helping to make me more aware

3829667 a few months after a very frightening experience with guillain barre syndrome i found myself sitting in a freshman honors english course at the university i had planned on attending one semester earlier the professor was a passionate and intelligent woman determined to lead our young minds toward the bigger picture your challenge reminded me very much of an assignment from her which required each of us to live one day as if it was the last day of our lives it was a wonderful and powerful twist of fate that i found myself contemplating the meaning of life just six months after i had almost lost mine six years ago i left that class with a deeper understanding of myself and a strong foundation upon which i could build my life today i am enjoying the construction i would spend my last 37 days in much the same way i spend most of my days i would be happy for each new day i would try to live more in the moment and to maintain perspective sure some things might be a sharp contrast to the usual i would quit my job even if day one was a sunday and i had to call my boss at home i would make all the necessary arrangements lest my family might select unsavory pallbearers and i would probably freak out a little in my own special way that involves the making of many lists but most of my days would be divided between doing the things i most enjoy and the things i most want to do i would visit the grand canyon and the smithsonian and the national holocaust museum i would host backyard barbeques and game nights i would rise before the sun and watch it emerge above the fields i would sleep late and make chocolate chip pancakes i would eat lunch with the guys at the counter i would have dessert before dinner i would play racquetball and go kayaking i would meet a real cowboy i would take hundreds of photographs i would be happy because where there is happiness there is meaning and where there is meaning there is happiness
3829668 i especially loved your keeping your family from picking out unsavory pallbearers smile and i recognized myself in the making of lists

3829671 what an overwhelming sense of urgency incompleteness and enormity of unfinished business crashes about one at the mere inkling of 37 days but then after the panic passes the sense of peace at knowing mortality and of having the excuse the reason the imperative to commence immediately right now the living of a life worthy of its contemplation brings an abating and a focus a few years ago shortly after both my parents died over a two and a half year period i penned the following imagine my delight when i ran across your work and found an understanding of the feelings i knew when i wrote mortality suddenly as if in a gust of cold icy breath stealing wind mortality entered my universe oddly it came not as a threat but as a fact a simple real undeniable fact it made me feel an urgency like a need to urinate physical undeniable elemental and eclipsing any conscious thoughts or silly concepts of self control or any illusion of any control for that matter it felt like god had tapped me on the shoulder not angry or spiteful just a loving reminder a word to the wise and a clue for the clueless i dont know what the acknowledgment of mortality requires of you but i will tell my wife how much i love her and how much i appreciate all that she has done for me and with me and how much i appreciate her forbearance her enormous love that i have squandered and taken for granted i have three sons a daughter four grandsons and four granddaughters who know nothing about me and i will tell them things ways to avoid breaking the hearts of those they love that money is nothing but a tool that family is the most important thing on the planet and that love is more valuable than anything they will ever own i will tell them that when the friend or family member is gone that the emptiness left behind can never be filled i will also tell them they will not for a while yet know what it is that i am talking about
3829672 patti i occasionally wonder if you have any idea how many lives you touch i wonder if you realize that in addition to all those who write to let you know there are countless others like myself who simply read and ponder and learn and fail to let you know how important what you do is i apologize for waiting so long to say thank you your work changes lives it is important it is worthy

3829675 this monday driving to work i realized that i had not sung in over a week really sung not humming along to a tune but a closed eyed body sing i havent put myself first and have let all the worries and troubles of life overshadow what makes me happy my whole life i have wanted to sing but something always came up its not realistic you need to get an education first come on you couldnt make it you couldnt make it you couldnt make it i have said that to myself over and over and over again how silly what is making it what is making it if you have 37 days left if i had 37 days left i would sing as much as i could with no thoughts of success or failure i would write as many songs as i could and sing for as many people as i could i would make sure to sing a special song for my mamaw i would wake up every morning grab my guitar and sing whatever i was feeling at that moment and at night i would lie in bed humming a tune to sleep i would hold a concert in a park and invite everyone that i love i would smile when i sing laugh and cry i would let it all out to the melody of sweetness and on my last day i would look into the eyes of the ones i love and smile hoping that they heard my song my life my gift to them

3829732 we ended up not too bad but itd be nicer to be faster on race tyres to be honest its been a frustrating couple of days here we got into the 31s about the fourth exit from the pits on the first day and really we havent been able to go any faster since then except with the qualifiers which were good weve chased our tail a bit and i havent really found a batch of race tyres i like
3829733 i struggled a lot when i was here for last years race but i did find something i liked i didnt have that option this week so i cant say im completely happy with the combination of bike rider and tyres we tried the pneumatic valve engine and the conventional spec engine in the new chassis at this test we did a lot of tyre testing with michelin using the conventional engine the chassis did some good stuff but not enough through this fast stuff here we left sepang last week in a positive way and its still early days theres a lot of work still to be done now we go back to sepang for two days weve got a few days off and then keep trying to chip away at it
3829734 i struggled a lot with the switch from 990cc to 800cc with the 990cc there was so much torque and power it was easy to make it slide and use the rear to turn on corners
3829735 with the 800cc theres virtually no slide and throughout the year i couldnt find a way to corner as efficiently as i wanted i was often running wide and it was easy for my rivals to overtake me
3829736 i was finding things difficult while my team mate casey stoner was on top form winning race after race so it was logical that the team focussed their efforts on him or to put it another way tried to adapt the bike more to his style than to mine
3829737 but more than ever im looking forward to all the testing and the start of a new season
3829738 why did i choose suzuki i had a lot of offers including riding on a ducati with a satellite team but with the suzuki technicians i had a good feeling ive already tried an updated bike compared to the machine they raced this season and feel that it really suits my riding style in january ill try the brand new bike and im very confident about it
3829739 leaving ducati was difficult but not sad i needed a new motivation and i found it in suzuki we have to work on various points to be ready soon we may have a small advantage from the tyres suzuki and bridgestone have had a great relationship for a while so thats only a bonus for us

3829782 anak anak begitulah ummat islam dan musuh musuhnya musuh musuh islam tidak akan menginjak injak kalian dengan terang terangan karena tentu kalian akan menolaknya mentah mentah premanpun tak akan rela kalau islam dihina di hadapan mereka tapi mereka akan menggulung kalian perlahan lahan dari pinggir sehingga kalian tidak sadar
3829783 jika seseorang ingin membangun rumah yang kuat maka dibangunnyalah pondasi yang kuat
3829784 begitulah musuh musuh islam menghancurkan kita ia tidak akan menghantam terang terangan tapi ia akan perlahan lahan mencopot kalian mulai dari perangai kalian cara hidup kalian model pakaian kalian dan lain lain sehingga meskipun kalian muslim tapi kalian telah meninggalkan ajaran islam dan mengikuti cara yang mereka dan itulah yang mereka inginkan

3829790 jika kalian membaca tasyahud maka berlindunglah dari empat hal yaitu berkata ya allah aku berlindung kepada mu dari adzab jahannam dari adzab kubur dari fitnah kehidupan dan kematian dan dari buruknya fitnah al masih ad dajjaal
3829791 selain dajjaal lebih aku takuti atasmu dari dajjaal jika dajjaal keluar dan aku berada di hadapan kalian maka aku melawannya membela kalian tetapi jika ia keluar dan aku tidak di antara kalian maka setiap orang membela diri sendiri allah akan melindungi setiap muslim dajjaal adalah pemuda berambut keriting mata kirinya menonjol seperti saya umpamakan dengan abdul uzza bin qathan siapa yang menjumpainya maka bacalah awal surat al kahfi dajjaal akan keluar di antara jalan syam dan irak berjalan membuat kerusakan di kanan dan di kiri wahai hamba hamba allah tetap teguhlah pada ajaran islam

3829794 maukah aku ceritakan berita tentang dajjaal sesuatu yang pernah diceritakan setiap nabi pada kaumnya dajjaal adalah buta dia datang dengan sesuatu seperti surga dan neraka apa yang dikatakan surga adalah neraka
3829795 dajjaal akan muncul pada umatku maka ia hidup selama 40 saya tidak tahu apakah 40 hari atau bulan atau tahun kemudian allah mengutus isa bin maryam ia seperti urwah bin masud maka isa as mencari dajjaal dan menghancurkannya kemudian isa tinggal bersama manusia 7 tahun tidak akan terjadi permusuhan di antara dua kelompok
3829796 perang besar pembukaan kota konstantinopel dan keluarnya dajjaal terjadi dalam 7 bulan
3829797 tidak akan terjadi hari kiamat sampai munculnya dajjaal dajjaal pendusta sekitar 30 orang semuanya mengaku utusan allah
3829798 selain dajjaal ada yang lebih aku takuti atas umatku dari dajjaal yaitu para pemimpin yang sesat
3829799 jika benar yang engkau lihat adalah dajjaal maka engkau tidak akan bisa membunuhnya
3829800 sebaik baiknya jihad adalah perkataan yang benar pada penguasa yang sesat
3829801 dan perangilah mereka supaya jangan ada fitnah dan supaya agama itu semata mata untuk allah jika mereka berhenti dari kekafiran maka sesungguhnya allah maha melihat apa yang mereka kerjakan

3829866 it was a lot more organized than previous years and truthfully the problems we had at the start of the awards were caused by the houston police dept and we are considering legal action but the overwhelming majority of attendees were pleased at the networking they accomplished the fun they had at the parties and the performances at the award show im actually really surprised at how so many websites are trying to spin this into something negative
3829867 we want to make noise when it comes playoff time

3829898 the reason for the escalation of the conflict was ceaseless shooting into the georgian villages by ossetian forces the georgian side requested from russian peacekeepers several times during the last two weeks to stop shooting but they did nothing and it was not possible to stop ossetians without attacking them thats why the georgian army went into the conflict zone in order to stop the aggression and re establish constitutional order in the region
3829899 as for the u s they want to have access to georgian territory for different reasons one is oil and gas transit and secondly establishing a military base for the u s army in the event of an attack on iran and for placing radars or anti rockets systems
3829900 we are punished for our aspiration to become part of a democratic world today our choice towards the west is threatened russian aggression is a challenge to the international community and every minute is critical for the lives of innocent civilians

3829908 is there a more forbidding more sinister side than the glittering facade held up by the powerful arms of the studio system
3829909 despite the absence of a real non serbian threat the main objective of the concentration camps especially omarska but also keraterm seems to have been to eliminate the non serb leadership
3829910 from the time when the serbs took power in the district of prijedor non serbs in reality became outlaws at times non serbs were instructed to wear white arm bands to identify themselves according to serbianregulations those leaving the district had to sign over their property rights and accept never to return being told their names would simultaneously be deleted from the census
3829911 omarska was a monstrosity an inferno of murder torture and rape it was a stain upon our century
3829912 instead of receiving information concerning the whereabouts of their family members they were in some cases offered the alternative of paying for an
3829913 all the muslims from the city prijedor were expelled we went to the local red cross gave them seventy dm for each family member and got on the buses there were thirteen buses in the convoy leaving from prijedor for teslic men were taken off my bus my husband was taken off the bus in blatnica a serbian village in the woods

3829915 to my knowledge he did not have personal enmity with anybody
3829916 hes one of the finest professionals that ive had the privilege to work with
3829917 when you talk about a raven hes a guy who is physical competitive and wants to win after being here a while one of the first guys i thought of was lorenzo neal
3829918 he gives us a fullback whos a heck of a player but he also gives us some flexibility with leron
3829919 thats not something were going to do in an emergency with willis situation it helps us it gives us some depth that we didnt have
3829920 the thing about him is that the players all know him
3829921 they all respect him all of our linebackers have been hit by him
3829922 kelly gregg has been hit by him as a matter of fact he threw off kelly greggs facemask a few years ago kelly still has the facemask in his den hes the kind of guy we want on our football team
3829923 im telling you that ball was moving left outside the uprights
3829924 i was going to get what i wanted practice this afternoon but somebody bumped it back in
3829925 the magic of matt stover i guess hes proven over a long period of time that hes one of the premier kickers in the history of the game
3829926 youve got to be able to put yourself in those situations as a kicker
3829927 theres nothing that can replicate that other than a game and thats as close as you can get in fact i think that was worse than kicking a game winner because you dont want to let your guys down
3829928 stover is the man but if he had missed it he would have been the most vilified guy on the team
3829929 it was less than what we thought it was and its getting healthy
3829930 i just want to make sure i get it right before i get back into action
3829931 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3829932 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3829933 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3829934 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3829935 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3829936 theres this thing they have in french lesprit descalier the spirit of the stairway i dont think we have a word for it in english
3829937 it means well the clever things to say that you only think to yourself when youre on your way out
3829938 all the cool stuff you wish youd said at the time
3829939 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3829940 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3829941 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3829942 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3829943 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3829944 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3829945 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3829946 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3829947 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3829959 i led in the abramoff hearings in the in the obscure indian affairs committee for which people are still testifying and going to jail
3829960 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption

3829966 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3829967 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
3829968 in this case it was determined that we need to move forward in a timely fashion

3829972 so was making serenity given the cancellation of firefly and so is half my career which is why i never write it off
3829973 those rumors are just rumors and i dont think theyre going to stop no matter how many times i say no its not happening because somebody will say he said yes his eyes said yes his nose said yes there was a yes iness about him because people want it
3829974 he didnt go to tibet and meet cool people but it was very similar in vibe
