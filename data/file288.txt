2880000 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2880001 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2880002 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2880003 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2880004 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2880005 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2880006 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2880007 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2880008 bright moon clear moon bright and fair lift up your right foot therell be a hair
2880009 there is a lot of foreign buying inlondon but so far india has been relatively untapped
2880010 conditions in july and early august prevented the deal frompushing over the line
2880011 more normal post summer conditions should be more favourableand the global investor base will be fully focused
2880012 the deal is likely to come back to market after theaugust break

2880017 love is something you choose love is when you put that person first in your life
2880018 the water was over his shoulders and actually was right up to the back of his neck
2880019 the only thing that kept him up was that he had his arms up and over the downed tree
2880020 they set up some pulley systems and were able to pull it out
2880021 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2880022 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2880023 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2880024 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2880025 theyve got a monopoly theyve got the whole state of new hampshire
2880026 its not one company its three companies concord coach boston express c amp j
2880027 perhaps we should have let them know as a courtesy
2880028 with 4 8 million we certainly could have expanded our structure
2880029 without any consultation with first transit the service plan was changed in such a way to restrict the competition for this work
2880030 people boston express were coming to us and asking to meet with us to talk about the program
2880031 we need to show our community support for the teachers and we need to show our community support for public education
2880032 lets try to get this thing passed and move on
2880033 you need to do research on these people who are organized year after year to fight the contracts
2880034 much of this organization is people who share an ideology that is not friendly towards public schools period
2880035 during a power failure were usually up and running again quickly
2880036 because we didnt know how long it was going to take to restore power this time the park decided to shut down
2880037 he really connected with them i think and that really showed jacob kind of who he could be
2880038 halfway through the movie he told me the other day
2880039 he was shocked he pointed out that im a big spider man fan but thats different
2880040 spidey is a superhero with super powers this is just a guy in a bat suit
2880041 a grown man reading a book that he wrote and being unable to read it aloud because of tears
2880042 the last thing i wanted to do was walk that guy
2880043 it was the perfect time for us because of our situation where were at
2880044 we really need to win thank god everything came through my way
2880045 guy throwing hard threw me a good pitch it sunk
2880046 tough to swallow whenever you go out there and you have a game plan and execute it and it still doesnt work out
2880047 its so fresh youre not going to get that from the grocery store they grow it right here and you know where it comes from
2880048 everyone tells us our sweet corn is the best thats because its less than 12 hours old when you go to the grocery store its three or four days before they even see it
2880049 its not shipped from out of state it just tastes better
2880050 were very proud to hire all local help a lot of farms will bring in workers from other countries for the season
2880051 the local teenagers are a little more expensive and you have to keep your eye on them a little bit more but it gets them off the couch and it keeps the money in the country
2880052 we were married a year when we bought the farm the hardest thing is probably the time commitment
2880053 but its definitely rewarding work you look out there and see how beautiful the produce looks and you can be proud of it and its definitely nice to have that time off in the winter
2880054 we got together two or three weeks ago and started throwing
2880055 the strategy is in the way you hold the pan
2880056 youve got to release it just so so you can get an arch and some distance
2880057 of course theres a certain national chain i wont mention that uses that phrase but our customers know that blakes really is the neighborhood place
2880058 the wait staff theyre our ambassadors theyre the face of the place
2880059 the first time we saw blakes we saw it from the customers view point we came in for lunch and no one knew we were potential buyers but right away you could sense the family feel of the place thats something we wanted to preserve
2880060 she was carmel tremblay back then and our three boys chris marc and paul worked here too
2880061 when i see the people whove worked here come back with their kids and grandkids
2880062 im convinced that weve trained half the work force in manchester
2880063 from today through friday were selling ice cream cones for 63 cents
2880064 on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays we have several specials priced at 19 63
2880065 wimax will offer three times the speed of a 3g mobile service the capex per subscriber can be put at one third the cost and the devices will cost half of that of a 3g phone with similar features the devices will also have better battery life
2880066 these loans are part of priority sector lending and borrowers in this segment need to be supported a higher loan growth in this segment will spur consumption which is good for the economy
2880067 it is time to transform the work culture be cost effective and get more low cost resources
2880068 a couple of days ago we had a guys only meeting where we shared some stories going back and forth about the hopes we have for this meet
2880069 thats all i have to say about that it shows you have to play the full 60 minutes
2880070 at the same time we had momentum why not push the envelope and go for the win
2880071 we wanted to show them we were a different team we took what they gave us and played smart
2880072 the only power he had in this life was to take

2880075 with the closure of this new financing we can complete development of the processes needed to produce lithium from brines and effluent streams in an environmentally conscious manner
2880076 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2880077 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2880078 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2880079 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2880080 you told me more about the process than i know
2880081 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2880082 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in
2880083 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2880084 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2880085 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2880086 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2880087 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2880088 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2880089 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2880090 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2880091 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2880092 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2880093 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2880094 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2880095 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2880096 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2880097 the culture the custom of the cajun people its gone
2880098 its another one of the rights that big government has taken away from the people
2880099 theyre still going to fight theyre still going to fight for years to come
2880100 theyve still got cockfighting in every state they just hide it from the law
2880101 cockfighting may still be going on with much smaller venues in the back woods but my understanding is there hasnt been any big activity since the gambling ban
2880102 a lot of people are going to quit theyre just going to shut down
2880103 were losing out on an opportunity to keep our heritage and our culture
2880104 that one might argue that they constitute little more than outdoor zoo populations
2880105 cannot be expected to expend funds indefinitely to maintain condors in nature
2880106 progress toward recovery is not sustainable under current conditions because reintroduction of more condors simply increases the costs required to keep wild birds alive
2880107 an extensive outreach effort to rally support for replacement of lead ammunition
2880108 poisoning from ingestion of spent ammunition in carcasses is so severe and chronic
2880109 that condor recovery cannot be achieved so long as such lead exposure continues
2880110 removing lead ammunition is not only right for condors it is right for other scavengers and it is right for hunters and their families
2880111 may be highly problematic california fish and game has done little to educate hunters and nonlead ammunition is not readily available or identifiable in many retail outlets
2880112 unlikely to comply as long as lead bullets are easily purchased
2880113 some tunnels want 100 a box some just 70 you have to compare prices
2880114 a tunnel can bring in a mobile phone but it cant bring in raw materials
2880115 its just a matter of time until they make a tunnel an elephant can walk through
2880116 i had five dunks in one game kobe bryant said
2880117 thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2880118 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours
2880119 this is the kind of support weve been getting lebron james said
2880120 it was great for the whole olympics for china to be the host team and for us to get to play them in the first game
2880121 i think basketball has become so global that they watch us day in and day out on tv carmelo anthony said
2880122 four years ago we wasnt getting no cheers from nobody except the little bit of people we had from the u s now were getting cheers from everybody different countries out there cheering for us
2880123 with the heat i have to go for 44 minutes and if i played d like this for that long my body would be broken down by january my job on this team is to really get into guys defensively
2880124 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
2880125 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
2880126 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story

2880135 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2880136 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2880137 all with no high i do it so fly banksy attack helicopter with the bow tie
2880138 you know what ill be honest with you im tired of making people money
2880139 seriously im the pi ata in this stuff all of a sudden they are punishing me
2880140 its pretty frustrating sometimes when they take that kind of money im not going to put up with that ill protect my players and do what i have to do but thats a lot of money and i dont know if people appreciate that
2880141 the whole seasons been great and the opportunity to play in both those places without ever being called up was pretty surreal
2880142 its a shame because ive never seen anybody more proud and want to be part of this
2880143 he was telling me when he was down oh man im disappointed i dont know what to do
2880144 everything he said was about how he disappointed the team it hurt to hear that come from somebodys mouth hes not worried that his career might be over hes worried about if he can help us this year thats a class man
2880145 this kid has a chance to be here for a few years
2880146 i like the way he plays i like the way he does stuff and so do the minor league people the coaches out there really like him and hopefully he can help with what we need
2880147 going into the year i mainly just played second base
2880148 and once we got down there and our season started they started inching me into playing short and then later some outfield and lately third base
2880149 so im happy its kind of gotten my foot in the door thats all you can really ask for
2880150 its real bad because jose is an unbelievable guy and unbelievable pro and his injury is not an easy one
2880151 its a big miss for us losing contreras but we have to keep going step up and do what we have to do with what we have here
2880152 if we start thinking about jose and what is going to happen then probably we dont come through
2880153 its a business so we have to think about what we have to do for this team our fans and this city

2880197 i have really focused hard on the majors the last two years
2880198 i have turned up to other events and unless i get into contention it feels like a race or a sprint
2880199 where as a major feels like a marathon i feel like i can be patient and take my time i love the feeling of knowing that it is going to come down to the back nine and who can do it under pressure on the last nine holes
2880200 i am a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win i knew i was playing catch up and those are the moments that change tournaments when you take shots on and they come off and you have to do it on the back nine you are not going to win any other way
2880201 i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
2880202 so that gave me something to focus on i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tiredness
2880203 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back
2880204 i have probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years

2880207 i love the idea of a back nine of a major on sunday so much that i am actually disappointed i am seven months away from the next major

2880311 i was walking past this rack with a new item and i thought of you
2880312 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2880313 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2880314 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2880315 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2880316 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2880317 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2880318 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2880319 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2880346 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2880347 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2880348 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2880349 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
2880350 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
2880351 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados

2880354 sie wirkt auch sehr souver n aber im gegensatz zu oliver kahn kann sie fu ball spielen
2880355 es stimmt nadine angerer spielt mutig aber die aussage von frau neid ist weit daneben man kann angerer genau so wenig mit kahn vergleichen wie frauen mit m nnerfu ball
2880356 er ist nat rlich ein super guter torwart gewesen vom spiel her w rde ich mich aber jetzt nicht mit ihm identifizieren da gibt es diverse andere torh ter die eher zu mir passen die mit der offensiveren spielweise der neuen generation
2880357 wie war denn das chancenverh ltnis 20 2 19 2 spielerisch und k mpferisch kann ich der mannschaft jedenfalls keinen vorwurf machen
2880358 unser spiel unsere bewegungen waren schon ganz gut ich w rde aber l gen wenn ich sagen w rde das spiel h tte nicht anders ausgehen k nnen
2880359 in der chancenauswertung sieht man den kleinen aber feinen unterschied zwischen kreisliga und bezirksliga
2880360 aber das sagt sich so leicht dass wir nicht wieder um den abstieg mitspielen m chten ich bin aber felsenfest davon berzeugt dass wir eine st rkere mannschaft haben als im vorjahr auch wenn die beiden aufsteiger hauenhorst und brochterbeck m chtig aufger stet haben sollen

2880363 we think people take political information from all sorts of sources in their daily life
2880364 and for some people oprah is clearly one of them
2880365 i needed to handle large databases and have tools to make proper decisions on which patients were to be selected for specialized and very expensive care
2880366 certainly this accomplishment would be possible without technology but that would take a lot of work from several people working continuously that costs a lot and it is very difficult to keep performance 24 hours a day on the highest level there will be mistakes misunderstandings etc resulting in repeated failures
2880367 by automatic alerts provided by qlikview this will simply not happen
2880368 if we allow ourselves to live the stress that were constantly under its going to get transmitted its counterproductive and its unpleasant
2880369 my business partner and i worked in the most god awful place for many many years and swore when we left there that we would never have that kind of environment in any place that we worked
2880370 its like household bills but on a much bigger scale

2880373 r amp d is basically seeking out new knowledge and the question is where are the good ideas
2880374 after world war ii the good ideas were loaded up in a small number of large companies
2880375 product markets got more competitive and those big companies couldnt sustain the long term investments in research that they could in the earlier period
2880376 so today no one has locked up the really good ideas
2880377 these are the big research challenges that we think are most important to our customers in the next decade
2880378 i decided to switch to one of these last november because it has a free bios program and no other laptop in the world that i knew of was available without a proprietary bios program
2880379 it took several months to arrange for us to get a machine and then for me to switch to it as i was switching in april the head of that project announced his betrayal of our community
2880380 the machines supposed to lead millions of children to freedom
2880381 but instead i fear it will lead millions of children under the dominion of microsoft
2880382 its completely misguided to try to make something a big success if its doing a bad thing
2880383 proprietary software subjugates the user its an injustice and the idea that its good to get people using computers regardless of everything else is shallow and misguided its better not to use computers than to use proprietary software

2880414 i was conceived in the u s but born in mexico my parents moved back to the u s three weeks later my mother took me to mexico to be born saying she didnt want me to be confused about my background
2880415 the genius of this is that its completely reusable they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
2880416 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
2880417 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
2880418 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable

2880443 but people need to be fully prepared for whats truly involved in caring for that animal realistically speaking they are bringing a child into their home if you dont have the temperament the schedule or the space requirements to meet those needs you should consider a pet that does fit your lifestyle
2880444 the reality is pets can be expensive and time intensive when you love your pet obviously you want to provide the best care possible so it is important to understand the costs and responsibilities ahead of time when choosing your pet

2880527 im a great believer in making it your own responsibility to win or lose in a major
2880528 you know the good thing about it is i i felt like i played good i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen so thats pretty much all i can ask myself to do
2880529 they deserted me then those guys were having such a good battle every hole it seemed like those guys were making something it was fun to hear and a lot of fun to play out there in a championship like this

2880533 it is very well known that during the past regimes temples were destroyed and attacked but vivekananda kendra international would like to revive our old historical bonds with the neighboring nation afghanistan and we must take initiative to have a dialogue with them in the context of our common heritage and civilization to strengthen our relationship with afghanistan and its people

2880588 that is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another the walls between old allies on either side of the atlantic cannot stand the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
2880589 yes there have been differences between america and europe no doubt there will be differences in the future but the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together a change of leadership in washington will not lift this burden in this new century americans and europeans alike will be required to do more not less partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity

2880591 some governments are prepared to give up elements of sovereignty to address the threat of global climate change

2880595 providing input into the spp through the north american energy working group and their intentions are clear in the case of energy what they want is a fast tracked continental integration policy
2880596 the first is to increase u s energy security by guaranteeing access to extensive deepwater reserves in the gulf of mexico including mexicos portion of it
2880597 the second objective is to open up oil and gas production and market to foreign companies
2880598 education in a scientific society may i think be best conceived after the analogy of the education provided by the jesuits the jesuits provided one sort of education for the boys who were to become ordinary men of the world and another for those who were to become members of the society of jesus in like manner the scientific rulers will provide one kind of education for ordinary men and women and another for those who are to become holders of scientific power ordinary men and women will be expected to be docile industrious punctual thoughtless and contented of these qualities probably contentment will be considered the most important in order to produce it all the researches of psycho analysis behaviourism and biochemistry will be brought into play
2880599 as a technique for acquiring power behaviourism is i think superior to psycho analysis it embodies the methods which have always been adopted by those who train animals or drill soldiers it utilizes the force of habit the strength of which has always been recognized and as we saw when we were considering pavlov it makes it possible both to cause and to cure neurasthenia and hysteria the conflicts which appear in psycho analysis as emotional re appear in behaviourism as conflicts between habits or between a habit and a reflex if a child were severely beaten every time it sneezed it is probable that a phantasy world would in time build itself up in his mind around the conception of sneezing he would dream of heaven as a place where the spirits of the blest sneeze unceasingly or on the contrary he might think of hell as a place of punishment for those who live in open sternutation in this sort of way the problems brought to the fore by psycho analysis can i think be dealt with on behaviourist lines at the same time it should be admitted that these problems whose importance is very great would probably not have come to the fore but for the psycho analytic approach for the practical purposes of educational technique i think it will be found that the educator should behave as a psycho analyst when he is concerned with matters touching powerful instincts but as a behaviourist in matters which a child views as emotionally unimportant for example affection for parents should be viewed in the psycho analytic manner but brushing teeth in the behaviourist manner
2880600 the most important applications of psycho analytic theory are to education these applications are as yet in an experimental stage and owing to the hostility of the authorities they can only be made on a very small scale it is however already evident that moral and emotional education has hitherto been conducted on wrong lines and has produced maladjustments which have been sources of cruelty timidity stupidity and other unfortunate mental characteristics i think it possible that psycho analytic theory may be absorbed into something more scientific but i do not doubt that something of what psycho analysis has to suggest in regard to education will be found permanently valid and of immense importance
2880601 so far no experiments have been made to test the effect of x rays on the human embryo
2880602 so far we have been considering those ways of influencing the mental life which proceed by mental means as in psycho analysis or by means of the conditioned reflex as in behaviourism there are however other methods which may in time prove of immense importance these are the methods which operate through physiological means such as the administering of drugs the curing of cretinism by means of iodine is so far the most remarkable of these methods in switzerland all salt for human consumption is obliged by law to be iodized and this measure has been found adequate as a preventive of cretinism the work of cannon and others concerning the influence of the ductless glands upon the emotions has become widely known and it is clear that by administering artificially the substances which the ductless glands provide a profound effect can be produced upon temperament and character the effects of alcohol opium and various other drugs have long been familiar but these effects are on the balance harmful unless the drug is taken with unusual moderation there is however no a priori reason why drugs should not be discovered which have a wholly beneficial effect i have never myself observed any but good effects to flow from the drinking of tea at any rate if it is china tea it is possible also that psychological marvels may become possible through pre natal treatment one of the most eminent philosophers of our day regards his superiority to his brothers perhaps humorously as due to the fact that shortly before his birth his mother was in a carriage which rolled down the simplon in an accident i do not suggest that this method should be adopted in the hope of turning us all into philosophers but perhaps in time we shall discover some more peaceable means of endowing the foetus with intelligence education used to begin at eight years old with the learning of the latin declensions now under the influence of psycho analysis it begins at birth it is to be expected that with the advance of experimental embryology the important part of education will be found to be pre natal this is already the case with fishes and newts but in regard to them the scientist is not hampered by education authorities the power of psychological technique to mould the mentality of the individual is still in its infancy and is not yet fully realized there can i think be little doubt that it will increase enormously in the near future science has given us in succession power over inanimate nature power over plants and animals and finally power over human beings each power involves its own kinds of dangers and perhaps the dangers involved in power over human beings are the greatest but that is a matter that we will consider at a later stage
2880603 whether men will be happy in the paradise i do not know perhaps biochemistry will show us how to make any man happy provided he has the necessaries of life perhaps dangerous sports will be organized for those whom boredom would otherwise turn into anarchists perhaps sport will take over the cruelty which will have been banished from politics perhaps football will be replaced by play battles in the air in which death will be the penalty of defeat they will not mind having to seek it in a trivial cause to fall through the air before a million spectators may come to be thought a glorious death even if it may be that in some such way a safety valve can be provided for the anarchic and violent forces in human nature or again it may be that by wise education and suitable diet men may be cured of all their unruly impulses and all life may become as quiet as a sunday school
2880604 it is to be expected that advances in physiology and psychology will give governments much more control over individual mentality than they now have even in totalitarian countries fichte laid it down that education should aim at destroying free will so that after pupils have left school they shall be incapable throughout the rest of their lives of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished but in his day this was an unattainable ideal what he regarded as the best system in existence produced karl marx in future such failures are not likely to occur where there is dictatorship diet injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible even if all are miserable all will believe themselves happy because the government will tell them that they are so
2880605 a crisis is an event which can force democratic governments to make difficult decisions like those that would be required to create a north american community
2880606 it may ultimately be necessary to redesign and relaunch a new process to take up the work of the spp under a new acronym
2880607 when there is fighting between politicians in parliament there are many explosions in the street
2880608 the iraqi side would like to say that forces should withdraw in the middle of 2010 while the american side says the forces should not leave until december 2011
2880609 the other disagreement is over the immunity of american soldiers
2880610 education has two purposes on the one hand to form the mind on the other hand to train the citizen
2880611 as for the manual workers they will be discouraged from serious thought they will be made as comfortable as possible and their hours of work will be much shorter than they are at present they will have no fear of destitution or of misfortune to their children as soon as working hours are over amusements will be provided or a sort calculated to cause wholesome mirth and to prevent any thoughts of discontent which otherwise might cloud their happiness on those rare occasions when a boy or girl who has passed the age at which it is usual to determine social status shows such marked ability as to seem the intellectual equal of the rulers a difficult situation will arise requiring serious consideration if the youth is content to abandon his previous associates and to throw in his lot whole heartedly with the rulers he may after suitable tests be promoted but if he shows any regrettable solidarity with his previous associates the rulers will reluctantly conclude that there is nothing to be done with him except to send him to the lethal chamber before his ill disciplined intelligence has had time to spread revolt this will be a painful duty to the rulers but i think they will not shrink from performing it
2880612 those children on the other hand who are destined to become members of the governing class will have a very different education they will be selected some before birth some during the first three years of life and a few between the ages of three and six all the best known science will be applied to the simultaneous development of intelligence and will power eugenics chemical and thermal treatment of the embryo and diet in early years will be used with a view to the production of the highest possible ultimate ability the scientific outlook will be instilled from the moment that a child can talk and throughout the early impressionable years the child will be carefully guarded from contact with the ignorant and unscientific from infancy up to twenty one scientific knowledge will be poured into him and at any rate from the age of twelve upwards he will specialize in those sciences for which he shows the most aptitude at the same time he will be taught physical toughness he will be encouraged to roll naked in the snow to fast occasionally for twenty four to run many miles on hot days to be bold in all physical adventures and uncomplaining when he suffers physical pain from the age of twelve upwards he will be taught to organize children slightly younger than himself and will suffer severe censure if groups of such children fail to follow his lead a sense of his high destiny will be constantly set before him and loyalty towards his order will be so axiomatic that it will never occur to him to question it every youth will thus be subjected to a threefold training in intelligence in self command and in command over others if he should fail in any one of these three he will suffer the terrible penalty of degradation to the ranks of common workers and will be condemned for the rest of his life to associate with men and women vastly inferior to himself in education and probably in intelligence the spur of this fear will suffice to produce industry in all but a very small minority of boys and girls of the governing class except for the one matter of loyalty to the world state and to their own order members of the governing class will be encouraged to be adventurous and full of initiative it will be recognized that it is their business to improve scientific technique and to keep the manual workers contented by means of continual new amusements as those upon whom all progress depends they must not be unduly tame nor so drilled as to be incapable of new ideas unlike the children destined to be manual workers they will have personal contact with their teacher and will be encouraged to argue with him it will be his business to prove himself in the right if he can and if not to acknowledge his error gracefully there will however be limits to intellectual freedom even among the children of the governing class they will not be allowed to question the value of science or the division of the population into manual workers and experts they will not be allowed to coquette with the idea that perhaps poetry is as valuable as machinery or love as good a thing as scientific research if such ideas do occur to any venturesome spirit they will be received in a pained silence and there will be a pretence that they have not been heard a profound sense of public duty will be instilled into boys and girls of the governing class as soon as they are able to understand such an idea they will be taught to feel that mankind depends upon them and that they owe benevolent service especially to the less fortunate classes beneath them but let it not be supposed that they will be prigs far from it they will turn off with a deprecating laugh any too portentous remark that puts into explicit words what they will all believe in their hearts their manners will be easy and pleasant and their sense of humour unfailing
2880613 education used to begin at eight years old with the learning of the latin declensions now under the influence of psycho analysis it begins at birth it is to be expected that with the advance of experimental embryology the important part of education will be found to be pre natal this is already the case with fishes and newts but in regard to them the scientist is not hampered by education authorities
2880614 in normal cases children of sufficiently excellent heredity will be admitted to the governing class from the moment of conception
2880615 the latest stage in the education of the most intellectual of the governing class will consist of training for research research will be highly organized and young people will not be allowed to choose what particular piece of research they shall do they will of course be directed to research in those subjects for which they have shown special ability a great deal of scientific knowledge will be concealed from all but a few there will be arcane reserved for a priestly class of researchers who will be carefully selected for their combination of brains with loyalty one may i think expect that research will be much more technical than fundamental the men at the head of any department of research will be elderly and content to think that the fundamentals of their subject are sufficiently known discoveries which upset the official view of fundamentals if they are made by young men will incur disfavour and if rashly published will lead to degradation young men to whom any fundamental innovation occurs will make cautious attempts to persuade their professors to view the new ideas with favour but if these attempts fail they will conceal their new ideas until they themselves have acquired positions of authority by which time they will probably have forgotten them the atmosphere of authority and organization will be extremely favourable to technical research but somewhat inimical to such subversive innovations as have been seen for example in physics during the present century there will be of course an official metaphysic which will be regarded as intellectually unimportant but politically sacrosanct in the long run the rate of scientific progress will diminish and discovery will be killed by respect for authority
2880616 i think the subject which will be of most importance politically is mass psychology mass psychology is scientifically speaking not a very advanced study this study is immensely useful to practical men whether they wish to become rich or to acquire the government it is of course as a science founded upon individual psychology but hitherto it has employed rule of thumb methods which were based upon a kind of intuitive common sense its importance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda of these the most influential is what is called education religion plays a part though a diminishing one the press the cinema and the radio play an increasing part
2880617 there is however a large amount of genuine experimental science in social affairs
2880618 this consideration brings us naturally to the subject of education which is the second great method of public propaganda education has two very different purposes on the one hand it aims at developing the individual and giving him knowledge which will be useful to him on the other hand it aims at producing citizens who will be convenient for the state or the church which is educating them up to a point these two purposes coincide in practice it is convenient to the state that citizens should be able to read and that they should possess some technical skill in virtue of which they are able to do productive work it is convenient that they should possess sufficient moral character to abstain from unsuccessful crime and sufficient intelligence to be able to direct their own lives but when we pass beyond these elementary requirements the interests of the individual may often conflict with those of the state or the church this is especially the case in regard to credulity to those who control publicity credulity is an advantage while to the individual a power of critical judgment is likely to be beneficial consequently the state does not aim at producing a scientific habit of mind except in a small minority of experts who are well paid and therefore as a rule supporters of the status quo among those who are not well paid credulity is more advantageous to the state consequently children in school are taught what they are told and are punished if they express disbelief in this way a conditioned reflex is established leading to a belief in anything said authoritatively by elderly persons of importance you and i reader owe out immunity from spoliation to this beneficent precaution on the part of our respective governments one of the purposes of the state in education is certainly on the whole beneficent the purpose in question is that of producing social coherence in mediaeval europe as in modern china the lack of social coherence proved disastrous it is difficult for large masses of men to co operate as much as is necessary for their own welfare the tendency to anarchy and civil war is always one to be guarded against except on those rare occasions when some great principle is at stake which is of sufficient importance to make civil war worth while for this reason that part of education which aims at producing loyalty to the state is to be praised in so far as it is directed against internal anarchy but in so far as it is directed to the perpetuation of international anarchy it is bad on the whole at present in education the form of loyalty to the state which is most emphasized is hostility to its enemies
2880619 modern inventions and modern technique have had a powerful influence in promoting uniformity of opinion and making men less individual than they used to be
2880620 it is the home secretary who has come to make a statement
2880621 but perhaps the most important of all the modern agents of propaganda is the cinema
2880622 there will of course be a universal language which will be either esperanto or pidgin english the literature of the past will for the most part not be translated into this language since its outlook and emotional background will be considered unsettling serious students of history will be able to obtain a permit from the government to study such works as hamlet and othello but the general public will be forbidden access to them on the ground that they glorify private murder boys will not be allowed to read books about pirates or red indians love themes will be discouraged on the ground that love being anarchic is silly if not wicked all this will make life very pleasant for the virtuous
2880623 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
2880624 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
2880625 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
2880626 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
2880627 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
2880628 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
2880629 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations
2880630 we just made one error and we hit the ball well
2880631 that error came in the last inning but when we hit the ball it was in crucial places taylor reed got a double with two outs in that fourth to score two runs and i think that was the dagger in their heart
2880632 i told them at the beginning of the game not to panic and except for that seventh inning error they didnt
2880633 when i saw hawaii i told them that is the team to beat and i knew i was going to have my hands full another thing that helped this team was the stolen bases we had which just put pressure on them these kids just came through in the clutch
2880634 i think he might have a strained tendon in his elbow but well find out for sure after we take him to the hospital
2880635 we worked hard last season and we got in that win column
2880636 it was great to see that the kids work paid off we started with only nine players had 12 before injuries brought us down to 10 and we already have more players to start this season
2880637 a lot of the games we lost were because the kids were fatigued in the fourth quarter there wasnt a whole lot of people to sub in but now with 16 or 17 players we can rest we have depth and guys can rest and get ready to play
2880638 we have a bit more speed than weve had before and were going to run at people
2880639 we had a one back attack and this year well have at least two backs with good speed well spread it open a bit too and throw the ball were going to be a lot more balanced
2880640 were going to need to get more pressure on the quarterback this year
2880641 weve been to a lot of six man clinics and learned a lot more about changing our philosophy from an 11 man set i think the coaches and kids are a lot better prepared this season
2880642 we cant join in any tapps district and were too far from other uil schools so this is a good alternative for us
2880643 it gives us something to look forward to something to play for we think this league will grow to maybe 20 or 30 teams over the next few years around houston dallas and san antonio its a great idea
2880644 if the kids come out and improve like we think they should then we should have a good season but thats why you play the games you never know but were excited about what we can do
2880645 ive made this clear to my clients that its an uphill battle
2880646 and once in the system the most likely outcome will be that they have to leave the country
2880647 now its a question of going on with what relief they have available
2880648 somebody would have a claim for asylum if theyve been harmed very severely in the past on account of political opinion race nationality or religion
2880649 suffered severely as children and to this day there is a lot of violence and in fact increasing in guatemala if they go home they could face significant risk
2880650 its the fund already had a dramatic effect in various places around the country in ensuring people actually get their day in court and are able to appear and get their due process rights to which they are entitled in immigration court
2880651 ensures that they are invested and the workers will go to immigration court
2880652 he has been here over 10 years and has a child who is a u s citizen the baby is a little over 3 years old
2880653 this is in no shape or manner a guaranteed thing you have to prove your case
2880654 dave wondered if he could make discs smaller denser and more aerodynamic like an airplane wing
2880655 mostly i play because i like to watch the disc fly
2880656 the basic mechanical skill needed to connect a club with a ball is difficult to achieve
2880657 the basic mechanical skill to throw a disc is easier to achieve
2880658 we just land up on the roof and lay there
2880659 the lost disc that landed furthest out into the lake
2880660 unlike america denmark which was so badly hammered by the 1973 arab oil embargo that it banned all sunday driving for a while responded to that crisis in such a sustained focused and systematic way that today it is energy independent
2880661 because i honestly believe that its an important holiday it was the end of the damn war its a shame so many people got killed with the dropping of the bombs but it ended the war and thats the most important thing
2880662 then when aug 9th came and they dropped the bomb on nagasaki we honestly felt that the war was over
2880663 its still a mystery to me what prompted him and he still doesnt know
2880664 most of my buddies ended up dying just in the last year theres no way of my expressing my love for these guys there was nobody like these guys in my life and there never has been these guys are the cream of the crop the best guys in the world i really loved them
2880665 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2880666 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2880667 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2880668 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2880669 a champion for working families and one of the most effective and empathetic voices in the country today
2880670 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2880671 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2880672 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement

2880683 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2880684 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2880685 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2880686 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2880687 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2880688 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2880689 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2880690 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2880691 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2880692 are not there yet but it looks like they are getting ready for it
2880693 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2880694 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2880695 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2880696 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2880697 is consistent with the moderation in economic growth seen in the second quarter
2880698 gdp growth in the second half is likely to be broadly similar to the first half
2880699 weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asian economies
2880700 the lower growth in the second quarter was mainly the result of a sharp contraction in biomedical manufacturing value added
2880701 stagnant growth in the electronics industry also contributed to the slowdown in gdp growth
2880702 we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalization
2880703 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2880704 they will either talk more in the language of de facto secession or start to negotiate
2880705 even if the government is strengthened it has to negotiate there is no other option
2880706 based on the statements by family members that mr hayes had been treated of late for a number of medical issues we believe that led to his death today there are no plans for an autopsy

2880732 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2880733 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2880734 we are pleased that in two separate patent cases in front of two different itc judges broadcom has prevailed at trial with rulings that support our position that sirf infringes our intellectual property but that we do not infringe theirs
2880735 prior to the itc trials earlier this year we had been optimistic that the companies would be able to cooperatively resolve their differences
2880736 however when that hope diminished we took additional actions to ensure protection of our ip rights we remain open to reaching a mutually acceptable resolution of these disputes

2880761 the current recommendation is for men aged 50 and older to be offered an annual psa test with explanations of its possible risks and benefits a federal preventive medicine committee this week said that psa screening should not be done for men aged 75 and older because the risks outweigh the benefits
2880762 es for the evil which lures and entices f is for fear and its many devices
2880763 people should be concerned but they should not be panicking
2880764 why does it take so long to replace one simple key
2880765 we dont stock keys or latches and apple doesnt either we have to order a whole new macbook pro keyboard and replace it with your current one
2880766 was opening on the 27th but they would be selling leopard at 6 00 on the 26th and it was only 15 minutes away i figured i would give that place a shot since it was new and closer to my house
2880767 so whether youre someone who keeps their desk clean or someone who has papers all over the place there will definitely be room for this small keyboard
2880768 as long as our starters give us a chance to win well take it
2880769 you can block do things to stop teams from making trades
2880770 i dont really look at this as anything new for me and danks
2880771 we are very confident in what we can do hopefully we all stay healthy strong and keep on the road to the playoffs
2880772 if not im going to have to start looking for other options
2880773 hes not hitting the only thing that i see is that hes not taking as many pitches
2880774 im going to put the best lineups that i can out there to win baseball games period
2880775 we were surprised by the variety of clay minerals in this region
2880776 but whats interesting is that we find the same ordering of the clay materials everywhere in mawrth vallis its like a layer cake of clays one on top of another all these layers are topped with a frosting of lava and dust we can see the clay layers where an impact crater has carved a hole through the surface or where erosion has exposed them
2880777 but it does suggest the long term and common presence of liquid water and concomitant active chemistry on the red planet in the distant past
2880778 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
2880779 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
2880780 the phoenix team has been waiting for complementary results from the thermal and evolved gas analyzer or tega which also is capable of detecting perchlorate
2880781 this is surprising since an earlier tega measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
2880782 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
2880783 initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry

2880785 we are a re sale store so we pay cash for items up front we are not a consignment store so if a gal wants to bring in her clothes we take a look at them and then offer a cash price for those we want to buy
2880786 our countertops are made of recycled sunflower seeds all of our hangers we use are recycled
2880787 its more of a green concept as well as getting good deals
2880788 were fairly particular on the items we take we want good stock for the store
2880789 were looking for better brand names womens fashions handbags coach louis vuitton standard handbags we have a quite extensive handbag selection shoes accessories jewelry sunglasses a lot of different accessories also and maternity
2880790 ive been on the last two relays where we came up short and to be honest with you i was tired of losing
2880791 we love listening to other people talk stuff about us because it just fuels us
2880792 i was going nuts as soon as he came off that last wall i was going crazy
2880793 i left it all out there everyone else at there got really fast
2880794 i dont want to go out like that and im definitely not going to go out like that
2880795 im happy for him thats a heck of a swim

2880797 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2880798 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2880799 rielle hunter the former presidential campaign aide who had an affair with john edwards said
2880800 we are excited to be testing our twitter output or as we call it tweet io drop io as a simple private information switch already had all of the infrastructure in place to enable twitter with all sorts of media inputs from video and pictures to documents audio voicemail etc the integration is certainly really cool and we are really excited to see how people will use it but as a company really just look at it as another output just like email alerts or rss feeds
2880801 ie8 fails the copies of acid2 due to the cross domain security checks ie performs for activex controls since ie does not natively handle html content in the object tag but rather uses ies rendering engine as an activex to display this html content the same cross domain security checks also apply
2880802 the site master page setting currently applied to this site is invalid please select a new master page and apply it
2880803 i wanted to go 1 45 and if it werent for that messed up finish i would have done it
2880804 i just wanted to save as much energy as possible for the relay
2880805 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2880806 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2880807 youve got to tip your hat to somebody that does something like that in a pressure packed race like that thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2880808 i just got to go home and take care of myself its going to be a tight final natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2880809 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2880810 by the way things were looking i wouldnt have either it just didnt look like things were falling in place for us
2880811 we slowly started to come around our pitchers started to come around then we got our rotation settled our assignments settled once we got that settled we started to pitch better then our hitters started to come around and our defense started to come around
2880812 thank god right towards the end were doing everything right
2880813 we could have folded the tent a long time ago im pretty sure a lot of people wrote us off
2880814 but it makes you cherish it more because you realize where you came from to get where you are at now as opposed to being there the whole season you appreciate it more when you get to a certain point after coming from the bottom of the pit
2880815 microsoft is not there to compete its there to destroy competition its an ethical illness
2880816 the vibe is very weird now at saatchi la people are secretive and quickly updating their resumes i have spotted many puzzled looks and confusion with the triple whammy two venza losses and harvery leaving
2880817 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
2880818 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2880819 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2880820 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2880821 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2880822 you can make music without ever have picking up an instrument
2880823 this is the biggest update since we first released ilife
2880824 here is a list of people who know me best please ask them if i am a christian
2880825 victorious living and effective soul winning service are not the product of our better selves and hard endeavors but are simply the fruit of the holy spirit we are not called upon to produce the fruit but simply to bear it
2880826 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control against such things there is no law
2880827 i am the true vine and my father is the gardener remain in me and i will remain in you no branch can bear fruit by itself it must remain in the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me i am the vine you are the branches if a man remains in me and i in him he will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing this is to my fathers glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples
2880828 i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i live in the body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
2880829 i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings becoming like him in his death
2880830 i cant be like jesus by trying to force myself to be like him
2880831 music is more than a language it is the language of languages
2880832 qu tarjeta o interface deber a emplear en mi estudio
2880833 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of change
2880834 were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization and the state takeover of companies
2880835 im glad he has won because mr morales is one of us hes working class like me i expect things to improve now because someone from the same background as me cannot let me down
2880836 the initial reading is that the political crisis and tension in the country is going to deepen greatly
2880837 the new long term garage is the first of three major projects within the overall expansion program at the airport to see the first project come in early and under budget gives us an incredible amount of energy as we head into the roadway work and the new terminal facility
2880838 it tells us that were on the right track and that as we move forward anything is possible when everyone is working together and focused on the same goals
2880839 were really excited about the project our joint venture with walbridge out of detroit and then just the good relationships with the designers the engineers the staff at the airport all working in tandem produced a good project
2880840 none of it involves taxpayer dollars or city of san antonio funds
2880841 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2880842 we want to thank them for the great support theyve given the coalition and we wish them well
2880843 we are supporting the georgian military units that are in iraq in their redeployment to georgia so that they can support requirements there during the current security situation
2880844 flights have in fact begun today and georgian forces are redeploying
2880845 god willing not only the georgian forces will withdraw but all other troops will leave our country and security and stability will come back to our land
2880846 we have the ability to serve video to lots of different pc and mac environments that otherwise would not get the greatest experience with traditional live streaming
2880847 silverlight lacks the ubiquity that developers need to push our software out there but having multiple cameras all streaming into a single player is something we havent yet been able to achieve in online video
2880848 after seeing the differences in how technicians in radiology and staff members in admitting use technology i understand the health care industry much more than i had from just reading or hearing about it i feel like ive lived it for a week
2880849 this experience will be a tremendous asset as i discuss technology solutions with health care providers and it puts me on the path to becoming a trusted adviser
2880850 it sounds clich but i found it to be a life changing event to spend an entire week in a hospital seeing every line of business and what they go through for patient care as well as the back end issues like patient records patient billing and dealing with payers it was great
2880851 whether or not they can defend it remains to be seen and im skeptical about that but the bottom line is dell will probably get this trademark
2880852 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2880853 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2880854 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2880855 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2880856 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2880857 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2880858 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2880859 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2880860 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2880861 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2880862 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2880863 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2880864 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2880865 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2880866 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2880867 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2880868 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2880869 these cartel leaders are starting to feel the pain and the natural response is to up the ante in terms of violence
2880870 i just wanted to go out and hold her a bit they wouldnt even let me go out
2880871 whilst we note that the imc has been asked to prepare a special report on paramilitary structures including the current status of the ira we will be making our own assessment and using our own security contacts
2880872 the briefings we receive on a regular basis establish the extent to which the ira has progressed with the dismantling of its paramilitary structures
2880873 it remains our position that the army council must leave the stage and that the ira should no longer function in any respect
2880874 the final ending of the provisional army council pac may be difficult to call if three of them met today to plan the way forward is this a pac meeting
2880875 they have not formally disbanded but they arent doing what they were set out to do and they arent a security threat
2880876 in a democratic society you clearly cannot have an army council it is for the police and the security services to deal with the dissidents
2880877 the key thing about policing and justice the minute it is devolved is the powers it brings to the office of the first minister and the deputy first minister
2880878 you cant have in government a party with a paramilitary structure
2880879 the ira have clearly gone off the stage and have done so since 2005
2880880 but theres still attempts being made by some people to drag them back on and i think thats silly
2880881 when thats decided we can look at the number of parishes needed
2880882 the laity are going to have to be more proactive
2880883 even with 1 500 priests in ireland currently there are 4 402 including secular priests and members of religious congregations we would still have one priest for every 3 000 or more people compare that with the priest i met recently in rural timor leste who has a parish of 30 000
2880884 personnel is not a major issue in the irish catholic church but morale is as is a sense of isolation lack of appreciation and low income
2880885 what is the right thing to do then find the way to do it
2880886 a priest of dublin name and address with the editor
2880887 if one wanted to devise a scheme to offend belittle and sow the seeds of dissension among the clergy it would be difficult to come up with anything better than his grace of dublin has managed to concoct in the manner of the dublin diocesan appointments 2008
2880888 a worrying disregard for the foot soldiers on which the church in dublin depends
2880889 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2880890 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2880891 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2880892 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2880893 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2880894 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2880895 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2880896 you told me more about the process than i know
2880897 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2880898 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2880899 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2880900 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2880901 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2880902 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2880903 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2880904 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals

2880913 its not the camera that takes the photo its the photographer
2880914 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2880915 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2880916 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2880917 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2880918 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2880919 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
2880920 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
2880921 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all

2880937 they activision liked my music and i have a big young following ive been told im from the old school i dont own a computer i just got an ipod that ive organized i have got to learn how to turn it on thats about it you know i cant download i cant do any load
2880938 i had to put on this black suit with all these little ping pong ball like things all over me motion capture i had to dance around like im on stage when one of my songs are on i dont really know how it works but i have seen a run of it it is really interesting the image of me i wish i had the energy it has the graphics are really really good
2880939 continuing in the same tradition as in the name of bach im doing a vivaldi album its my personal homage to the composer who represents the city of venice to the world my fellow venetian antonio vivaldi im choosing excerpts from the four seasons to some more obscure pieces two musicians from venice meet across the centuries
2880940 a heavily groove oriented electronica that features massive amounts of orgiastic guitars
2880941 im not afraid to venture into the world of dance music i like the idea of electronic sleaze shred
2880942 the third project is a rock album based on more traditional instrumentation but no less daring in terms of envelopes being pushed and cliches thrown out the window
2880943 dengan demikian kapasitasnya akan meningkat 15 persen di setiap titik node b tinggal tunggu waktu saja mudah mudahan minggu ini selesai
2880944 dengan pembangunan hub tersebut maka kecepatannya akan mencapai rata rata 1 4 megabyte per second
2880945 nantinya hub hub tersebut juga dapat meningkatkan performa layanan data telkomsel khususnya dari sisi bandwidth
2880946 langkah ini pun sejalan dengan rencana telkom sebagai induk perusahaan yang berminat untuk fokus di jalur
2880947 the throw from first was a little wide as i reached for the ball her spike hit me right above the knee pad i was wearing
2880948 they had to put staples in my knee to close the cut
2880949 the school record is eight or nine triples and i finished the season with six
2880950 it was the top of the seventh inning with two outs and the home run helped us win the game
2880951 we were playing on a regular field too so the ball had to go about 300 feet
2880952 last year my goal was to get at least 40 hits and i finished two short
2880953 this year i want to get at least 50 hits and hit over 350 i also want to keep improving myself and win a championship
2880954 we almost beat montclair and they won the championship so i think we have a good shot
2880955 in college everybody is more competitive i was very lucky to get a starting spot as a freshman
2880956 playing goalie helped me keep in shape and also helped me practice diving
2880957 i want to play professionally but its tough because there are so many good players and so few teams

2880963 its very traditional quebec winemakers are just as hardy as the grape varieties they grow

2880978 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2880979 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2880980 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2880981 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2880982 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2880983 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2880984 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2880985 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2880986 the car the voice the man they all came together in some perfect embodiment of cool that we are unlikely to see again very many times in our lifetime

2880988 you know me i have no clue when im eligible they told me i retired i still thought i hadnt retired i dont know what to do im up in the air baseballs strange sometimes to me they do what they want to do
2880989 but its not my decision in my familys heart and a whole lot of fans they would say yes i feel i went out there and played the game right i played the game well i accomplished a lot of things a lot of what the hall of fame ballplayers have done so i feel i deserve it but well see what happens
2880990 i played for the dodgers in 93 in the major leagues
2880991 then i played in an independent league a couple of years until 95 or somewhere around there they say that doesnt count but i thought everything counts when youre trying to get back into the game if i come out my first year and they say youre going into the hall of fame ill be happy to be there
2880992 theyll choose my time to go in the hall of fame
2880993 so im happy whatever they choose as long as im in there with some of the great ballplayers
2880994 if you saw rickey henderson play you know deep inside in his heart he really loved the game he put everything into playing the game and he had fun playing the game i had a great time out there playing the game
2880995 its almost becoming too easy his complete games have been the thing
2880996 that harvey was framing the context of george steinbrenners mr may comment to winfields performance in the 1981 world series the column did not however actually say that steinbrenner made the comment during the series
2880997 i see no reason to publish a correction in this instance because there was no specific mistake
2880998 me parece fundamental el proceso que encabeza evo morales no s lo para bolivia sino para el mundo entero que est enfermo de racismo aunque siga siendo una enfermedad rara vez confesada

2881005 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins
2881006 kzzz kzzz kzzz je comprend rien on dirait un film
2881007 i have seen the miserable state of my people in egypt
2881008 i have heard their appeal to be free of their slave drivers
2881009 who am i to go to pharaoh and bring the people of israel out of egypt
2881010 im a physician or a third grade teacher or a venture capitalist but what i really want to do is write
2881011 ive always loved writing since i was a little girl
2881012 ive got a great idea for a mystery thriller philosophical love story if i only had the time
2881013 and i have a great idea for a unified field theory if i just had a moment to work it out on paper
2881014 i have a story inside of me i mean i know everybody has a story but i really have a story
2881015 book in progress please do not disturb unless youre bleeding
2881016 beware beware her flashing eyes her floating hair weave a circle round her thrice and close your eyes with holy dread for she on honey dew hath fed and drunk the milk of paradise
2881017 be the person you want to be at the expense of everything
2881018 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hard core family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2881019 one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2881020 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2881021 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather
2881022 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2881023 a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives
2881024 his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set
2881025 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2881026 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2881027 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2881028 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
2881029 only one of us could make it over the wall
2881030 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2881031 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2881032 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2881033 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2881034 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2881035 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2881036 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2881037 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2881038 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2881039 i should have known that people would feel that way
2881040 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2881041 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2881042 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2881043 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2881044 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2881045 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2881046 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2881047 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2881048 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2881049 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2881050 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2881051 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2881052 we are going to smash the u s thats what we are here for
2881053 im playing a killer im not going to give anything else away
2881054 its a bank robbing movie so its one of those action packed films you get a little different side of me in that movie

2881057 at the end of the day im going to focus on my music first
2881058 but me being onstage enhances me being in the movie and then me being in the movie acting catching characters gives me time to transform into a different character onstage
2881059 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them

2881062 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2881063 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2881064 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2881065 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2881066 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2881067 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2881068 the soulsville foundation which operates the stax museum of american soul music stax music academy and the soulsville charter school is so deeply saddened by the passing of isaac hayes that we are in state of shock

2881084 push ed her out of the way and elbow ed her in the left breast victoria counters that when one of the crew handed her napkins she protested
2881085 accusing me of stuff i didnt do i was dumbfounded
2881086 victoria failed to comply with the flight attendants instructions and they were asked to leave the flight fbi spokeswoman luz garcia said
2881087 the account of the event which has come to our attention is inaccurate and overblown the misunderstanding was minor and was resolved when victoria voluntarily removed herself from the situation
2881088 regardless of how some have portrayed the situation please know that it was truly a minor misunderstanding and did not escalate into what you saw or read in the news contrary to those reports it was my choice to remove myself from the situation nonetheless it was a most unfortunate event and i truly regret that it happened
2881089 but as a way to conclude the matter and avoid any embarrassment for her church
2881090 god designates men to guide protect and succor their families and his church
2881091 its easy to get into a survival mode when times get tough and things arent going our way if were not careful well develop this survivor mentality to where were not releasing our faith were not believing to rise any higher the voice of victory is found in gods word it says you are blessed you are prosperous you can do all things your best days are still ahead

2881104 like every war before it the war on terror or to call it what it is the war against totalitarian islam is a nasty brutish endeavor it is fraught with obscene excesses and squalid idiocies because like every war before it it looses the primordial evils of tribalism and bloodlust to which the human race even at its current stage of evolution remains heir

2881133 you have been with me through all the bad times when i got fired you stuck right beside me when my business went under there you were when we lost the house you were there when i got shot you stuck with me when my health started failing you were still by my side
2881134 the americans were going to crush them thats why were here
2881135 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2881136 i thought im good im going to make it into the final
2881137 i slowed my tempo down a little bit i wasnt expecting it
2881138 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2881139 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2881140 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2881141 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2881142 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2881143 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2881144 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2881145 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2881146 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2881147 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2881148 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2881149 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2881150 larguei bem mas o carro se mostrou muito inst vel no tr fego e n o consegui manter o mesmo ritmo optamos por fazer um pit durante a bandeira verde para podermos mexer na asa dianteira e isso me custou uma volta ao voltar para corrida mudei de estrat gia e permaneci na pista mais tempo para tentar recuperar a volta perdida
2881151 a cada pit a equipe fazia ajustes que melhoravam a estabilidade do carro enquanto estava sozinho na pista mas a dificuldade no tr fego permaneceu foi uma corrida muito dif cil e cansativa
2881152 praticamente n o andei no circuito por isso larguei muito atr s 24o fiz uma boa largada mas logo fui ultrapassado e n o consegui acompanhar os meus advers rios mas a corrida servia como experi ncia
2881153 quando o pneu furou o carro perdeu rendimento mesmo ap s a troca os comiss rios entenderam que eu estava andando muito devagar e representava risco para os outros competidores fui obrigado a abandonar
2881154 we just overpowered the race track it pretty much canceled out our chances of getting into the top 10 for the countdown and thats what weve been shooting for all year i never thought wed be in this spot but we are it was a big blow and were pretty much mathematically out of it
2881155 the upside is that were qualified well for the 100 000 showdown bonus event in seventh at indianapolis and that gives us some hope weve got eight more races left in the season and were just going to keep getting after it there are still races to be won well go to reading in a week and see what happens
2881156 left side of theatre seating rear mezzanine left of center stage row g seat 9
2881157 we were a little behind at first and we kept tuning on it and kept paying attention to what we needed to be doing and the car kept getting faster and faster
2881158 that chevrolet was flawless today we had to make some small changes to it but it does add pressure especially since you know the car is going to be fast if you miss the tree you can be quicker at the finish line and still lose it definitely adds pressure and you have to perform it costs a lot of money to run these cars and the driver has to perform to keep my job i have to do what i have to and its all on the tree thats free horsepower and ive never seen free horsepower in the dyno room
2881159 dave connolly jeggie greg anderson jason line they have good days and theyre the best we race against them every weekend and to go out there and have a great day like i did today to leave on the four competitors i left on makes me feel awesome
2881160 the best part of the whole weekend is when you close the doors and you pull in the water theres nobody talking to you you do your job you go out there you let the clutch out and youre focused thats all there is to it youre focused on doing a good job and the hometown fans definitely helped
2881161 that is whats fun about this class its not just the driver not just the crew not just the engine guys you have to have everything we had a good day we made it to the final we may not have secured ourselves of a top 10 spot yet but this really gave us a little cushion anyway after being on the edge of our seats all the time it was a winning week for sure
2881162 it was a tight drag race two good lights and two good runs we were just on the losing end of it
2881163 ive felt good behind the wheel in the last couple of weeks and im getting my confidence built up a little bit now well pack it up and go to reading and see what happens
2881164 this is probably one of the toughest eras to be racing in
2881165 its bad timing on my part but were surviving and were very fortunate to be winning races i had never won a race here in brainerd i was runner up when i drove for force so this is a big achievement for me to be able to pull the win off today theres never a bad time to win but we realize we need to get ourselves back in that second spot and i think weve done that all the points will be critical from this point on
2881166 sometimes you force them into making mistakes when your cars running good and our car performed well today im just happy to win a race here we had great conditions and we put a smile on these peoples faces a lot of good close racing just so tough mentally on the drivers but were in the business of entertainment for us the racers its all about nuts and bolts and oil and spark plugs and filters but its really a form of entertainment and i think we did a good job of being able to pull this off
2881167 i have to have a certain amount of confidence and i have to remind myself of that
2881168 you take all this stuff away and i think im pretty humble because of where i come from and how i was brought up i look across the pit and see don schumachers team and john forces and i was in the stands watching these guys i was kid taking pictures of force when i was 12 years old that part of me will never change but theres a competitive nature that was instilled in me when i was a child i know what its like to be on the top and i know what its like to be on the bottom and i dont want to go back there
2881169 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2881170 its been core duo core solo basically were going to simplify nehalem down to just core
2881171 i said this violence is unacceptable inot only said it to russian prime minister vladimir putin i have said it to the president of the country dmitry medvedev
2881172 and look i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2881173 and i was very firm with vladimir putin just like i was firm with the russian president
2881174 there needs to be a international mediation there for the south ossetia issue
2881175 i think the olympics are going to serve as a chance for people to come and see china the way it is and let the chinese see the world and interface and have the opportunity to converse with people from around the world
2881176 this is a very positive development in my view for peace
2881177 first of all i think the chinese are being great hosts the venues are fantastic and our team is fired up and so am i im excited to be here its such a thrill to watch our men and women compete
2881178 their response was thanks for coming we are really really honored to represent america and i was impressed by them and of course they go out and put on a great performance
2881179 we dont want adults sending mixed messages to children that its okay to shoot up drugs in order to become a star because its not okay
2881180 its very important for the american people to know that coming here gave me a chance obviously to root for our team but its also coming here is a sign of respect for the chinese people
2881181 theres a great connection you know i can remember riding my bike around beijing in 1975 and it is unbelievable how far this has changed
2881182 the script isnt as important as what actors do together
2881183 i cant think of a single specialist batsman or bowler who played a large number of odi games and did extremely well who could not make it in test cricket
2881184 those of us who work in technology particularly in the areas of security and liability are very concerned about elections
2881185 our concern is that these electronic systems could be tampered with or more likely have problems with the software and the results cant be audited or recounted if there is a question
2881186 we can do better we have technology that produces a paper version of the vote in addition to the electronic version
2881187 this allows for quick counting and it doesnt have the error of human counting
2881188 at the same time we have paper ballots as a backup and verification in case the counts come out very odd in some respect or in case there is some question
2881189 result in the complete flooding of the indigenous charco la pava community
2881190 i observe with concern the human rights violations suffered by members of the charco la pava community
2881191 result in the complete flooding of the indigenous charco la pava community
2881192 with this study we looked at a very large population to determine how each individual could be stratified based on his or her dna
2881193 we want to see if the snps tied to a specific ancestry hold any biological significance to populations of different origins we want to see if the snps that we isolated are related to natural selection and adaptation for example to the weather conditions of different regions
2881194 because this method is purely computational and leverages linear algebraic methods such as principal components analysis without the use of information on self reported ancestry we were able to treat the data as a black box
2881195 much of the genetic variation was found to stretch between two points what we speculate is the northern european to southern european ancestry axis
2881196 the new state of the art laboratory will be able to process more samples faster in the event of an emergency animal disease outbreak and will be located within the aahls advanced high biocontainment facility
2881197 aahls core responsibility is to respond to outbreaks of emergency animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease or equine influenza
2881198 the new high throughput testing laboratory will play a dual role at aahl
2881199 in the face of an outbreak the laboratory will become an assembly line for samples and will enable aahl staff to perform serology tests on up to 10 000 samples per day with maximum biosecurity
2881200 australias outbreak of equine influenza in august 2007 demonstrated the need for a high throughput laboratory in australia
2881201 last year australia faced the major challenge of eradicating equine influenza following comprehensive national and state disease control and surveillance programs australia is provisionally free from equine influenza
2881202 although the focus in recent months has been on equine influenza foot and mouth disease is still considered the greatest threat to australias livestock industries
2881203 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
2881204 comparing observations with results from computer models improves understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
2881205 differences can relate to deficiencies in the measurements or the models used to predict future climatic change
2881206 my parents systematically deforested in order to plant more coffee plants now we know that this was a mistake
2881207 the certification is a mechanism to avoid the slide towards deforestation
2881208 the marketing strategy is to persuade the big certified coffee purchasing groups that this corresponds to demand from consumers sensitized to the question of sustainable development
2881209 one is already seeing the effects of climate change here this year it has not rained very much and if that continues we are going to have problems
2881210 people want to know how people make decisions whether its how you drive your car or whether to invest in a mortgage its important to understand when and how we make those decisions to understand the type of errors people are prone to make
2881211 what we have found is that people make decisions based on what option appears to be better most of the time under conditions in the natural world this would be the best strategy but in modern life it has nothing do with the real inherent risks
2881212 you save one minute but you can lose everything people dont do the math
2881213 weve evolved to be afraid of snakes but not traffic lights
2881214 if you give feedback and rewards to employees in a clear way they might be more willing to take risks on your behalf
2881215 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region thats very industrially active
2881216 capmex will be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
2881217 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2881218 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in the polluted regions of the atmosphere
2881219 capmex takes this work an important step forward with new micro and nano sensor technologies these technologies will provide new estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
2881220 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2881221 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2881222 the need to demonstrate our sovereignty in the arctic has never been more important which is why our government has made this research a top priority
2881223 our commitment to this initiative as well as other investments in the north is ultimately about turning potential into prosperity for this remarkable region and for our country as a whole
2881224 this joint research is another step supporting canadas submission in relation to the extended polar continental shelf in the high arctic
2881225 there will be a battle between canadian and danish scientists on one side and the russians on the other
2881226 i dont see a period in the history of earth during which these two continental plates were connected
2881227 save someones life and you have a burden for life
2881228 it is extremely improbable that we will have the structure and financial ability to take on all the people who require art antiretroviral therapy and then treat them for life
2881229 if you add the current 35 billion that is being spent in the developed world youre talking at that time about annually needing almost 90 billion dollars in a continuous fashion
2881230 and that doesnt even take into account complications with secondary resistance to drugs and other issues
2881231 a kind of curious passivity among the international aids establishment
2881232 landslides have hit many areas but flash floods have caused the largest number of deaths
2881233 at least 800 houses have been destroyed or damaged we are still trying to get in touch with local authorities to help the people there rescue efforts are ongoing but they are being slowed by the severe weather
2881234 this was a very nice neighborhood when we bought this house
2881235 we had raccoons nest in the house i was given traps to capture them when they wander in our yard
2881236 we are looking to have some of the worse houses in the city taken down
2881237 we owe that to the people living in the neighborhoods
2881238 we obviously could have taken down more homes if we were not spending money on asbestos removal
2881239 we want to tear down at least five houses a year
2881240 for a small city five houses a year is good we are fortunate that we have not suffered from the housing crisis as much as other cities
2881241 we certainly hope all members will come to a consensus on allowing an exception for india
2881242 listen to key countries and talk to key countries and japan is certainly one of them
2881243 we do understand that japan is going to ask questions and issues that they want to raise
2881244 but i think those questions and issues do indeed have good answers solid answers because in the end the deal contributes to non proliferation
2881245 which candidate would you rather have sleeping on your pillow
2881246 the area of the baku ceyhan pipeline was bombed by russian planes miraculously the pipeline was not damaged
2881247 this piecemeal approach to solving our national energy problem is ridiculous
2881248 the u s is no longer in a position to say this option is okay but that option is not okay only a broad gauge solution that takes advantage of all energy options will adequately address the problem
2881249 stop the useless debate between proponents of oil and gas drilling and those who support more renewables and conservation
2881250 no single energy source can provide a satisfactory solution for americas energy needs
2881251 we cannot drill mine or farm our way to energy sufficiency no combination to the exclusion of others will suffice
2881252 it is operating its business as usual there is always a lower demand for power on a saturday but it is running
2881253 nioc is from now on obliged to deposit 100 percent of crude oil export income in foreign bank accounts that are chosen by the central bank of iran
2881254 this decision was made after the expansion of new rounds of sanctions against iran so that irans assets are not blocked in foreign banks
2881255 many foreign banks and even some chinese banks have cut their financial operations with iran and these restrictions increase day by day
2881256 todays my birthday and i stood in line for an hour to meet you
2881257 he gave me hugs and kisses it was a real thrill
2881258 i dont watch the show but shawn is hot and i wanted to take pictures
2881259 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2881260 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2881261 when investors realized how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realized how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2881262 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too
2881263 you should convince millions of chinese and indians who are willing to live an american way of life that they dont have to buy cars they dont need a fridge
2881264 every 25 pounds we remove we save 440 000 a year
2881265 rioters hang another negro mobs in springfield ill defying 3 000 soldiers string up old and innocent victim
2881266 he insisted on a smaller town hall setting where he would be as close to the people as possible he wanted to be able to shake hands to look people in the eye
2881267 im told we had to turn a few people away but it wasnt because of the lack of room once mccain entered the hall the secret service secured the doors
2881268 there were a lot of new faces that hadnt attended previous presidential visits they probably never thought to leave their pocketknives at home they had to either throw them away or take them back to their cars
2881269 i wouldnt be surprised to see a vice presidential candidate visit
2881270 trilogys national solar offering is a significant advancement within the sustainable building movement and gives california an even greater chance at achieving governor schwarzeneggers goal of building one million solar roofs by 2017
2881271 we commend their decision to offer solar throughout the state and nationally and for choosing a team that offers a quality product backed by a 25 year warranty and installed by a team of solar roofing experts
2881272 with the addition of solar in a home were no longer just efficient users of electricity we become producers integrating a solar system into a home during construction is less expensive than adding it later making solar more accessible and affordable than its ever been
2881273 trilogy homes pass the true test of a green home by integrating a mix of energy saving and energy generating devices that deliver immediate and long term benefits for our customer
2881274 there are clear cost advantages to installing solar panels compared to having transmission lines particularly in areas that are not easily accessible
2881275 moreover solar cells are easier to manage and maintain than other sources such as wind or nuclear
2881276 polysilicon prices are as high as 200 per kilogram since silicon which forms the base substrate for most solar modules is currently experiencing heavy shortage
2881277 the dearth of raw materials is preventing many manufacturing plants from operating at 100 percent capacity driving up the prices of solar modules and hence deterring potential investors
2881278 this is a great opportunity for the city to support our plan to help significantly reduce the citys greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time promoting the re use of energy that would otherwise be wasted
2881279 i am especially proud that city administration continues to search for ways to reduce our contribution to global climate change i believe our efforts can create a more efficient government improved air quality and a better quality of life for all durham citizens
2881280 an isaf soldier died in southern afghanistan august 9 after an attack from insurgents
2881281 before the negotiations commence georgia must withdraw its forces from the zone of conflict
2881282 we have heard about ethnic cleansing in villages in south ossetia
2881283 we are willing to do a ceasefire immediately provided the other side stops to shoot and to bomb
2881284 nato remains very concerned there is no doubt about that
2881285 the negotiations that we nato and others are calling for can only be based on georgias territorial integrity
2881286 the nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer continues to believe that all sides involved must immediately cease military operations and start negotiating
2881287 if the discoverer discloses the vulnerability to a broader audience hackers and other malicious users may be able to exploit the vulnerability
2881288 it is strongly in the public interest to protect this system
2881289 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2881290 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2881291 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2881292 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2881293 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2881294 you can guarantee that more of these will become common in future elections
2881295 more than likely the people who do this are the extremists or people who are in it for a profit campaigns need to become more aware of these kinds of attacks
2881296 obama is paying for advertisements through google on a site that is a typo squatter on a domain name the obama campaign should own in the first place
2881297 campaigns are spending a lot on online advertising and some of this money is really being misspent and going to typo squatters
2881298 if i want to attack supporters of a particular campaign i can easily put malware on my site
2881299 you can target candidates cause confusion pop up ads or re direct computers when they try to log on to a candidates website
2881300 this is a serious problem that spans not only campaigns but every company with email
2881301 even more scary we went and looked at defense contractors and found a typoed domain routed to india and another routed to china
2881302 we were ready to leave today we are ready to leave immediately but we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi
2881303 we are discussing with the americans the conditions of our departure which may take place tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2881304 well face structural changes so well have to make changes fortunately they are in a stable area of iraq
2881305 they are setting up checkpoints with the border with iran and controlling entry and exit
2881306 their departure will not cause a vacuum or have any effect because wasit province is stable and iraqi forces were about to take over security of the province
2881307 we greatly value the importance of this program and remain committed to producing the highest quality products that can be trusted by the men and women serving our nation
2881308 its an insane bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province
2881309 in this sense it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action
2881310 its an insane bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province
2881311 it is nothing less than the threat of war we are facing the threat of a dangerous fire
2881312 the delivery of the first five ridgback vehicles represents an important step in our continuing efforts to provide critical protection for the british forces
2881313 through the efforts of many people within force protection we are able to deliver these first ridgback vehicles one month ahead of schedule

2881315 h jeg har s m nd bare vundet olympisk guld i dag
2881316 what we found out especially with the war coming along was that we had some capabilities that would be useful for the soldiers that are in the field today or at least sooner than 2015
2881317 so the army went back looked at that and decided to spin out some of the systems from the core program
2881318 its like flying a remote controlled plane really only its slower you can hit stop if you dont know what youre doing or you can make it hover it makes it really easy to fly
2881319 sometimes its frustrating because its new and doesnt work all the time other times it works great thats what were going to have in iraq so were trying to get it the best we can
2881320 part of the future of the army is to have a ubiquitous network end to end that allows the soldier from the foxhole to get intelligence or situational awareness from higher and also for whatever hes collecting to go higher
2881321 if it has to increase power to send the data over that distance it will do that if it can
2881322 or if it actually has to decrease power because maybe thats not as important a transmission as another transmission or the distance isnt as great it will do that as well
2881323 were really at the beginning of a long journey and one of the reasons were out here in this culminating event is to make our final assessment of where we have to go
2881324 we know that some stuff worked some stuff didnt work so well
2881325 you can imagine that when youre doing it by direct fire youre in more danger than when youre doing it by indirect fire because what weve allowed the soldiers here to do is to be able to see the area that they would normally have to go into blind
2881326 what i like best about all of this is that were getting an opportunity to use tools weve already learned and integrate them now with the new age of battle new robotics early warning devices and all that kind of stuff
2881327 its pretty much in the long run going to keep soldiers alive
2881328 whats not normal here is to have an entire unit thats formed to use our equipment in this early stage of development and give us feedback on it understanding that for them sometimes that can be frustrating because parts of it dont work well parts of it work really well
2881329 soldiers are used to getting equipment that works right away what were asking for them to do is to use stuff that were just starting with and give us feedback so when it actually gets deployed it does work right away for the soldier

2881677 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2881678 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2881679 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2881680 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2881681 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2881682 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2881683 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2881684 it will be one of the toughest races for michael to win the world record will be in danger

2881686 that was one of the most amazing swims ive ever seen in my life
2881687 he absolutely blew me away hes going to be on fire now its going to be hard to stop him
2881688 the four of us set out to do something that not a lot of people thought we could do
2881689 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2881690 i just think he was caught up in the moment
2881691 there are a lot of middle aged men and women who i know that tell me that im an inspiration to them and theyre now doing things they thought they couldnt do
2881692 im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think theyre too old to do something
2881693 im going to just try to stay patient to relax
2881694 ill try to stay off my feet for a couple of hours
2881695 the key to winning elections is simply working harder get out and meet your neighbors develop a record of community activism and learn how to deflect any attack and stay on message
2881696 you can help the party by expanding on how to be known as the nice neighbor i noticed that far too many libertarians are loners they dont join organizations and they dont become actively involved they often state the organization is flawed
2881697 examples american legion is fighting for a flag amendment therefore i will have nothing to do with them aclu wont fight for gun rights therefore i will have nothing to do with them boys scouts wont allow gay leaders therefore i will have nothing to do with them churches preach discrimination therefore i will have nothing to do with them naacp pushes for social welfare programs therefore i will have nothing to do with them gay groups are lead by the democrats therefore nra wont therefore league of women voters wont therefore the list goes on and on and on
2881698 i dont think that we can construe from the northern territory some grand lessons for western australia
2881699 obviously were going to wait and see the results to be finalised during the course of this week
2881700 this is an extraordinary swing and it underlines the disillusionment australians are seeing and feeling with the lack of leadership
2881701 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2881702 i dont think its worth me getting what i would call premature stress over something that may not occur
2881703 but that doesnt mean im not going to give it serious thought in the meantime
2881704 you cant play table tennis in there without a 20 bet being put down so worrying about where we are going to finish and how many games we finish doesnt even come into the thought process
2881705 the enjoyment you see on the boys faces there this morning after winning the game how can you tell them to lose its a ridiculous thought
2881706 ive played good footy at centre half back for this club ive played good footy at centre half forward full forward and in the middle
2881707 over 70 per cent of total global emissions are generated from cities and if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
2881708 i like the fact no other european has won two majors consecutively
2881709 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2881710 once i got to the weekend and made a few putts it was a question of adrenaline keeping me going
2881711 you just have to give it a go from my experience in majors i know that nobody goes without making mistakes
2881712 i knew i would get my opportunity and it was going to be my day i took that opportunity
2881713 when i started making putts i just stuck in there and it brought my game up the more i got into it the better i played
2881714 i had to convince myself not to get into this sentimental thinking that maybe it is his turn
2881715 i had to convince myself that it is going to be my day i deserve to win three majors you have to be very selfish in this situation when you are on the golf course
2881716 it was evident at carnoustie when i won i was so focused on what i was doing and the high of it and then i turned around i saw sergio and i could see the disappointment and that there was a loser that day
2881717 when i got up to the green i had no idea which was which
2881718 im 10 feet and sergio is four feet i knew i had the opportunity to get the putt in first that was important i knew if i holed this i would probably win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win the pga it was down to that
2881719 i hit a lovely putt read it exactly and it did exactly what i wanted
2881720 i feel like i played well enough to win but it didnt happen thats pretty much all i can ask of myself
2881721 every time you are out there trying to win a major there can only be one winner
2881722 i feel like i putted well today just a couple of putts that didnt want to go in when you give it your best and the end result is not what you wish for it is hard but you feel like you gave it your best
2881723 my little brother i love you so so much and cant believe they have taken you from us
2881724 such a wonderful special person so kind and caring and loved by so many

2881734 ken was a kind caring man who would always pick things up and put your dustbin tucked neatly out of the way just a very nice caring man
2881735 he was a man that just would do small lawn mowing jobs do kind helpful things for people
2881736 they were just an elderly couple that lived here for years and just went about their own business

2881738 too many residents said this group is just harassing any animal they can lay their hands on
2881739 our call centres just been flooded people are saying enoughs enough
2881740 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2881741 old block home that has not been lived in for many years that we need to get it up to code
2881742 we will have just a few animals here those that we need to quarantine until they are healthy enough for adoption or if someone gives an animal back and we dont have a foster home for them
2881743 this is the place where people will be able to interact with animals before they adopt them
2881744 we havent modelled that but we would not expect it to have any impact
2881745 senator what i am saying is that the prices you are talking about are generally set in international markets and this would not have any impact on those prices
2881746 as far as we are aware no approaches have been made to treasury for a meeting from the north west shelf
2881747 just because you want to achieve a particularly result to use one policy tool such as the carbon production reduction scheme or whatever its called that doesnt mean you need to have an uneven situation for another policy tool
2881748 we would not expect this to have any impact on exploration in other areas but we have not necessarily modelled that in particular either
2881749 the reason we would not expect it to have a significant impact is that the only major offshore area affected is the north west shelf
2881750 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2881751 are not there yet but it looks like they are getting ready for it
2881752 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2881753 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2881754 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2881755 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals

2881757 when you want something all the universe conspires to help you achieve it
2881758 i love the idea of the back nine on sunday at a major
2881759 i love it so much that im kinda disappointed theres eight months until the next one i need the adrenaline
2881760 i feel like ive played well enough to win more than two majors throughout my career to this point
2881761 unfortunately it hasnt happened that doesnt mean im not on the right track its just a matter of time
2881762 paddy is just so mentally tough and hes a great putter
2881763 when he gets an opportunity he always takes advantage of it
2881764 hes won three of the last six majors thats tiger like right there he knows how to win and hes not afraid to win and thats what it takes
2881765 i just need to keep believing in myself im pretty happy with the way this week worked out
2881766 i guess i should have told my caddie to take the pin out
2881767 there was a lot of beer being consumed in that section of the course
2881768 you cant ask much more out of him right now for what he does he keeps making plays
2881769 it would be great to get a guy like watkins or a guy like rookie wide receiver chaz schilens if they were able to make the team
2881770 they both are guys that can contribute on special teams
2881771 i didnt know where i was going to be after each year whether i was going to sign with that team or if i was going to move on
2881772 but now im extremely excited i have a great opportunity on a team that is on the rise this team has great potential and im excited to hopefully be a part of it
2881773 it feels good to come out here and practice and hear the fans go oooh ahhh with the big catches interceptions and big hits
2881774 it just gives you energy for practice and we enjoy that
2881775 its just good to relate with the fans because lets face it weve been terrible the last five years and for them to still come out and support us the way they do my hats off to them
2881776 so i had darren stand next to me and told shane to throw him the ball
2881777 it was good to see coach rob ryan compete rob heard me whisper that so he whispered to hiram about 10 yards ahead of him to go cover him so it really didnt work
2881778 as far as an organization trying to rebuild around young guys thats important
2881779 a lot of guys i know who were drafted its five or six deep at their positions im not saying im ahead of anybody in this organization but theres a good chance to speed up the process in the situation im in who knows what would have happened if i had been drafted by another organization im fortunate to be where i am and happy to be where i am
2881780 its not for sure hes signed yet as far as im concerned were not teammates yet at the time we were both trying to win for our schools if i had a chance to go back i probably would have said something to him
2881781 his emotions were running high it wasnt overboard compared to other guys you see
2881782 yes i was definitely excited to strike manny ramirez out
2881783 hes one of the greatest hitters in the game im young thats probably not going to happen again but im not saying it might not happen sometime in a big game in a different situation

2881787 those who dance are considered insane by those who cant hear the music
2881788 in the breast of every single american is a heart that beats for liberty
2881789 given that the electoral college favors a two party system that many republicans are actually libertarians in republican clothing yet they dont want to move their vote to the libertarian party so as not to throw their vote away for the slightly better republican candidate what must the libertarian party do in order to attain the critical mass to get over the tipping point
2881790 remember i became a libertarian just two and a half years ago
2881791 but dude arent you just going from one extreme to the other
2881792 but what about helping others isnt renouncing this world in favor of retreat totally self indulgent
2881793 martyrdom why do i have to do all the work
2881794 public works are not accomplished by the miraculous power of a magic wand
2881795 giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys

2881797 if i were the companies i would be issuing public disclosures five nanoseconds after the indictments were announced
2881798 if not there could be big checks the companies will have to be writing
2881799 telling the public that theyve been breached is embarrassing for them it makes them suffer a loss of goodwill and in the case of public companies the stock price goes down
2881800 we believe the credit card information was coming out of an officemax in north carolina
2881801 ongoing federal investigation involving legitimate debit card use at various retailers that was later tied to fraudulent transactions outside the u s
2881802 we have no knowledge of a security breach at officemax
2881803 it would be inappropriate to express our views relating to an ongoing criminal investigation
2881804 for the purpose of downloading credit card information of customers of forever 21
2881805 because we couldnt find any definite information that wed been breached
2881806 because there is no way for us to identify customers who might have been affected
2881807 the consumer always does have an opportunity to report fraudulent activities
2881808 had not received inquiries from credit card companies or customers about these alleged activities
2881809 the initiatives for reforms in philippine elections whether that initiatives will be coming from the government and private sector must continue and must start right now to ensure that the general elections by 2010 is orderly clean and honest
2881810 at the end of the day it is always the people in armm in particular and the country in general who can make or unmake holding of a vote buying free peaceful and free elections
2881811 despite many election laws to punish violators it is never honestly implemented due to too much politicking
2881812 ihr m sst euch immer an das unm gliche wagen sonst erreicht ihr es nie
2881813 dont worry das ist ein gutes zeichen eine kobra muss sich h uten um wachsen zu k nnen genauso muss dein geist vergangenes verarbeiten und sich reinigen bevor er weiter wachsen kann
2881814 the volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult
2881815 this is not a classical recession that has a self healing character
2881816 things will happen in the next two years that will shock people
2881817 until you reform the management and compensation structures it will be difficult for banks to earn anyones trust
2881818 if citigroup is a utility vital to the public good then they cant reward themselves like saudi princes
2881819 we need to do everything the environmentalists say we should do and everything they say we shouldnt do
2881820 i think its going to be pretty evident that the officer was fearful of his safety and life and thats why he had to fire
2881821 all the same the indications are that somebody was totally jumped and beaten if thats what the investigation says they have a right to defend themselves
2881822 our job isnt to interfere with the investigation but to gather information for our internal purposes
2881823 one of the reasons for that federal law is that police officers unlike anyone else are almost on duty all the time
2881824 you never know when you might run into someone who you arrested
2881825 are supposed to keep the peace not rile up the crowd
2881826 the decision to fire is up to each individual officer only you know when you feel the time is right and your life is in danger
2881827 its a traumatic incident any time someone has to fire a handgun
2881828 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2881829 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2881830 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2881831 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2881832 you told me more about the process than i know
2881833 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2881834 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in
2881835 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2881836 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2881837 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2881838 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2881839 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2881840 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2881841 raising fdic guaranteed account limits would only increase the potential costs to taxpayers while providing benefits to a very small number of wealthy depositors
2881842 we should tighten mortgage lending regulation by establishing minimum standards for subprime loans including requiring mortgage brokers to prove that borrowers have the ability to pay we need to simplify truth in lending disclosures and require that the cost of borrowing especially long term be fully disclosed to borrowers finally we should require all lenders to report on the status of their loans in their annual home mortgage disclosure act filings
2881843 deposits are a private contract between the customer and the bank when the bank fails the government has no right to steal my money to pay off depositors who have more money than i have
2881844 congress should act now to encourage long term growth by making lower tax rates for new hampshires small businesses permanent and opposing the increases in capital gains taxes and social security taxes proposed by barack obama we should also work to help small business provide health care coverage to more employees by allowing them to join together to negotiate better prices and purchase insurance from providers nationwide finally an economic plan should include a balanced approach to energy that includes conservation incentives for clean renewable energy and greater production of oil and gas deep offshore
2881845 first and foremost we need tax cuts for middle class families and small businesses not for giant oil companies and companies that ship jobs overseas second we need to invest in infrastructure development that will save us money in the long term and create good jobs repairing and building roads bridges and schools in the short term third as our economy is struggling it is critical that we protect programs like medicare that provide people affordable essential services like health care finally we need to bring our troops home from iraq and take the 12 billion a month that we are spending there and spend those resources at home
2881846 those checks were a scam to buy votes with stolen money stolen by the inflation tax repeal all business license fees and more people can go into business

2881848 we need a comprehensive energy policy that focuses on investment in alternative and renewable energy sources tax incentives for energy efficiency and increased domestic production i believe that the oil companies should be drilling on the 68 million acres both on and offshore that they currently lease but do not drill i also believe that we should end the billions of dollars in tax giveaways to big oil and use that money to invest in the development of alternative and renewable energy sources that are going to create jobs and move us off of our dependence on foreign oil
2881849 congress needs to look at hydrogen powered cars for federal agencies such as the armed forces that would stimulate private research because investors would know theres a ready market mostly however its state governments and their subdivisions imposing zoning restrictions that prevent people from living closer to work shopping and drinking places and preventing energy efficient apartments where single family homes are allowed houses have more exposed sides than apartments zoning dilutes population density so fewer people wait at each bus stop preventing bus lines from breaking even

2881857 i also believe that we should end the billions of dollars in tax giveaways to big oil and use that money to invest in the development of alternative and renewable energy sources that are going to create jobs and move us off our dependence on foreign oil

2881893 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2881894 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community

2881896 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for

2881917 the air is so thick you sweat through your clothes in minutes and stay wet all day
2881918 most importantly i was able to practice how i will mentally attack the race
2881919 for me the mental preparation is just as important as the physical i can go to the starting line knowing that i have some ammunition in my back pocket
2881920 one race in mind thats my heat on the 15th you cant do anything in the final unless you make it through the two rounds before that

2881950 my boyfriend and i were walking along singapore river this evening and while trying to take a nice picture of alkaff bridge we noticed someone swimming or what seemed like a nice bath in the river
2881951 there was another guy holding a towel waiting for the swimming guy to finish
2881952 the guy caucasian came out of the water and started to parade naked while the other guy tried frantically to cover his private parts with the towel and he started to wear his jeans in the open without his underwear apparently
2881953 45 minutes later when walking back to robertson quay we saw two policemen questioning the said caucasian hes now wearing jeans and a red t shirt with no shoes and the other guy w

2881957 the win has underlined the progress we have made were not the finished article but we are going in the right direction and we have shown we are competitive with the biggest teams around
2881958 what are you thinking about back there how to create an iron man suite
2881959 we played a smart match we stuck to the basics and chose the right game plan of intelligent kicking and good defence
2881960 the referendum in its current form would undermine the vital humanitarian work of many psychologists
2881961 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2881962 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2881963 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2881964 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2881965 la moneda tiene que estar hecha por alguien que se dedique a ello el trabajo es impresionante
2881966 this is my message to my house democratic colleagues we know that a number of them are with us
2881967 we are going to call on them today to cross that picket line to take a stand in their district and publicly call on the speaker of the house to bring this congress back
2881968 i am confident that right this minute there are at least 50 democrats who would vote for an energy bill they would go for offshore drilling on the outer continental shelf ocs for 50 miles out
2881969 let me just add that i know for a fact there are at least 15 or 20 congressmen who are dying just dying to get it a drilling bill on the floor there are others who are just frothing at the mouth because they cant get a vote on the floor
2881970 we have a bipartisan majority for a first time in years that would support more drilling thats why we are doing this
2881971 my perception i am not aware of aware of a single house democrat who has either expressed publicly into her district that the speaker should call a special session back or has indicated any interest at all in coming back to capitol hill
2881972 vean el mont n de c maras que tenemos vean a la vieja guindada de un trapo en el techo

2881975 im the queen of snooping it has ruined saved many relationships with my last relationship i found out about all of his other girlfriends by going through his cell phone text messages i confirmed the relationships by texting the girls i also had access to his email accounts
2881976 but honestly if you need to snoop odds are he shes not the one
2881977 they were raised in households where family members role modeled snooping as acceptable
2881978 snooping is extremely unhealthy and reinforces mistrust on both sides
2881979 if you feel the need to snoop take it as a sign its time for open and direct communication if you suspect your mate is cheating tell him her why you feel that way and trust that the truth always comes out
2881980 during the past eight years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of surveillances initiated because of information or
2881981 during the 80s and 90s women relied on intuition and men a gut feel with the 21st century boom in technology people can simply click a mouse and read i love you or i cant wait to be with you again or i loved the threesome
2881982 i was snooping on a now desk and actually found that he had been snooping on me
2881983 i also caught myself snooping at one point another boyfriend had left his phone at my house and it rang incessantly after a certain point i checked the phone number and didnt recognize it i actually answered the phone to a girl who said she was dating him interesting how that kind of snooping changes a relationship
2881984 i stayed over at her place one night and while she was in the shower and getting ready for work i decided i would snoop around her desk and in her purse
2881985 after thinking very carefully about the situation i confronted her a few days later she denied everything but i broke up with her anyway a couple of weeks later she called and confessed how theyd met on a business trip that it was just a fling and that shed like us to stay together i met the love of my life the next year so it was definitely the right move to leave on the other hand snooping made me feel terrible so i wont ever be doing that again
2881986 i lived with my boyfriend for two years he was a wonderful sweet guy but was sometimes very possessive if we went out and i said hello to another guy in passing i was bombarded with 10 questions who was that how did i know the guy had we dated or slept together
2881987 the real problem began when we decided to stay together
2881988 it takes an instant to violate trust and sometimes years to get it back
2881989 we tried to reconcile a year later but the gap in trust becomes a canyon over time i believe that the only way snooping makes sense is if you are truly prepared to leave if you find something you dont like once you invade someones personal accounts you have crossed a line that changes everything if you love and trust someone confront them if there is an issue dont snoop
2881990 such as a relationship where the partner cheated or a family where one parent had a drug problem but usually the suspicion arises because theres indication that all is not ok
2881991 maybe money is disappearing or the partner is tied to the computer for hours and neglecting other aspects of life or theres something furtive and secretive going on
2881992 sometimes people snoop because private things are left lying around and are too tempting or because the privacy level of each partner is vastly different adults who were only children are usually much more private than those raised with a lot of siblings
2881993 shortly after i started dating my now fianc i snooped through his email he left it open assuming i wouldnt go that low but i had a feeling he corresponded with a couple of girls including his ex i found a ton of crap i wished wasnt in there
2881994 he had emails with his ex about how she knew something was going on with me and she was sick of the rollercoaster ride he told me he had cut communication off completely
2881995 it took a while but he eventually talked me down
2881996 i decided to stay with him because this was the beginning of the relationship i know people come with baggage they have to get through in order to be all yours he never really got upset about my snooping i said that his dishonesty and me knowing better led me to this he agreed and things got better i snooped for another six months and when i found nothing and we had built up our relationship i let it go even though it was a terrible feeling to find all the crap going on behind my back i am glad i did it sometimes its a painful yet necessary means to an end
2881997 when you start snooping where you dont belong you are always going to find something that will upset you whether its a confirmation that he or she has been cheating or spending money on something they didnt tell you about the act will not make you feel good when you go looking to shake up the status quo you will do just that
2881998 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
2881999 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness
2882000 executives realize that if employees are stressed out financially have excess debt it really makes them less productive
2882001 theres a real financial benefit to the company a long term financial benefit for their employees to be on track for retirement and financially fit
2882002 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2882003 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2882004 scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2882005 ive been on the last two relays where we came up short and to be honest with you i was tired of losing
2882006 we love listening to other people talk stuff about us because it just fuels us
2882007 i was going nuts as soon as he came off that last wall i was going crazy
2882008 i left it all out there everyone else at there got really fast
2882009 i dont want to go out like that and im definitely not going to go out like that

2882019 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2882020 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2882021 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2882022 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2882023 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2882024 everyone is kneaded out of the same dough but not baked in the same oven
2882025 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2882026 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2882027 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2882502 porque eu sei que em mim isto na minha carne n o habita bem nenhum pois o querer o bem est em mim nao porem o efetu lo
2882503 portanto a nica salva o que podemos obter em jesus cristo somente uma opera o divina pode nos salvar de todo pecado e consequentemente da morte jesus falou que deveriamos nascer novamente para que pud ssemos fazer parte do reino de deus

2882518 i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon to be honest we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
2882519 i was very comfortable with my game there here that wasnt the case i wasnt happy with the way i was swinging something had me a little off once i holed a few putts it was a question of adrenaline keeping me focused keeping me pushing ahead
2882520 the only thing i know from experience is that no one goes without making a mistake in a major
2882521 i knew if i could hang in there i would get my opportunity and if it happened i would take the opportunity
2882522 i knew if i holed this putt i win the pga
2882523 i shot 69 68 on a tough sunday at a major
2882524 so im pretty happy about that unfortunately i obviously came up a little bit short the only thing i can do now is go home with my head up high and keep working on it i felt like i gave it my best i felt like i responded well he was obviously very good on the back nine and things just happened his way

2882534 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2882535 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2882536 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2882537 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2882538 you told me more about the process than i know
2882539 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2882540 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2882541 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2882542 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2882543 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2882544 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2882545 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores

2882674 if the general citizenry look at a situation like that and they think the people have to know that this is a drug home or theres a high volume of traffic in and out it doesnt necessarily mean that were ignoring that its just that were building a case a stronger case so we can go in there with a search warrant and an arrest warrant
2882675 were seeing different factions of gangs now we just went past one of those electrical boxes thats a gathering spot where the gang members go so thats the reason we pulled up there and made them leave the area

2882684 on 23 march 1994 the medical examiner viewed the body of ronald opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound of the head
2882685 a person who sets out to commit suicide ultimately succeeds even though the mechanism might not be what he intended
2882686 the room on the ninth floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife
2882687 when one intends to kill subject a but kills subject b in the attempt one is guilty of the murder of subject b
2882688 the continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couples son loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal incident it transpired that the old lady cut off her sons financial support and the son knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother the case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of ronald opus
2882689 further investigation revealed that the son ronald opus had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to engineer his mothers murder

2882716 sharks are just one part of the oceans web of life
2882717 but these studies show if you pull out that one thread the whole web suffers
2882718 some fishers have decided to switch to sharks because they cannot make up their product with bony fish
2882719 at these levels these sharks can be considered functionally extinct meaning that they cannot perform their role of top predators in the mediterranean marine ecosystems anymore
2882720 we now understand that both on land and in the sea large predators play important roles in regulating both the total number and the behavior of their prey
2882721 unchecked by their predators some of these prey species can wreak havoc on ecosystems this is one important reason to keep predators around in sufficient numbers
2882722 even though these are wide ranging and fast moving sharks they are at risk

2882737 as an aim syndicalism is so absurd that speaking generally it has not found any advocates who dared to write openly and clearly in its favor
2882738 in its early stages the industrial system required the kind of specialized labor now this is no longer true
2882739 we do not wish to deny that the nineteenth of july 1936 brought with it an overflowing of passions and abuses a natural phenomenon of the transfer of power from the hands of the privileged to the hands of the people it is possible that our victory resulted in the death by violence of four or five thousand inhabitants of catalonia who were listed as rightists and were linked to political or ecclesiastical reaction but this shedding of blood is the inevitable consequence of a revolution which in spite of all barriers sweeps on like a flood and devastates everything in its path until it gradually loses its momentum
2882740 the committee is the paterfamilias it owns everything it directs everything every special desire has to be submitted to it for consideration it alone has the final say
2882741 if someone has a girl outside the village can he get money to pay her a visit the peasants assure me that he can
2882742 i tried in vain to get a drink either of coffee or wine or lemonade the village bar had been closed as nefarious commerce
2882743 with the abolition of money the collective held the upper hand since anyone wishing to travel had to get republican money from the committee
2882744 puritanism was a characteristic of the libertarian movement excessive drinking smoking and other practices that were perceived as middle class attributes were nearly always censured
2882745 there are supposed to be laws of economics i cant understand them
2882746 imagine a future society that conforms to the exigencies of human nature as best we understand them the other to analyze the nature of power and oppression in our present societies
2882747 the only way were going to get action is if those who stand in the way of action come to be perceived as not just wrong but immoral
2882748 we spent most of last night working on a fix for a worm which was targeting people on facebook and placing messages on walls urging users to view a video that pretends to be hosted on a google or youtube web site
2882749 less than 002 percent of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware
2882750 i think you should continue with school and get your masters you love school little does she know i really hate it and you are good at it just think how nice it will be when i tell all of my friends that my daughter has her masters what do you think
2882751 ohh ya that is nice hunny if you really are up to the challenge you should but only if you want to of course
2882752 so i can learn more confidence about math and reading and build my skills up
2882753 i like to see children grow and gain more awareness
2882754 i enjoy doing it i dont have kids of my own so i look on them as my babies
2882755 mr erskine i came up with a new joke today
2882756 i misspelled july fourth to about 12 of my friends
2882757 im not too happy about it i mean i shouldnt have been there in the state that i was in but i wasnt really thinking there would be someone driving past with a video camera on the roof filming me either
2882758 come monday morning i got out of the taxi and rolled over on the grass and went to sleep on the footpath
2882759 what do you do when you lose a mate like that you know
2882760 i know what he would have done if i left he wouldve partied too thats what i wouldve wanted him to do so thats what we did
2882761 i was absolutely horrified i was horrified that anybody had even heard about it
2882762 while recognising that google time is never real time the image renews the raw loss
2882763 while others may have legitimate complaints about google publishing pictures of their house i was delighted to views ours with me pictured hard at work in the garden complete with broom and bucket thereby dispelling any uncertainty as to who is the gardener in the family
2882764 as a police officer im supposed to be setting a good e

2882766 weve been encouraging black men to get screened at age 40 or 45 for more than a decade yet only one third of these high risk men reported being tested
2882767 our findings provide an important baseline assessment of psa test use among young men as physicians debate whether to expand use of the psa test in young men with risk stratification strategies
2882768 that was the first question i had when i came in for the job interview
2882769 all most people know about belmont is that it was supposedly so toxic
2882770 and that it was very costly people i meet tell me they thought it was demolished that it was never going to be
2882771 school safety is going to be a concern the gases and stuff
2882772 the names of the things on top of the lights
2882773 can the school be operated safely yes but it also has to be monitored and maintained for the life of the school without failure thats the biggest concern many people have had that over time people would become less concerned and think less about the purpose of the system
2882774 as a project belmont was far ahead of the capacity of the district and the quality of the people who were involved in the undertaking
2882775 since that time a lot of projects of a similar scale were undertaken and completed
2882776 i doubt that the legacy of belmont could be measured in a positive way that offsets the cost of its history
2882777 i was relieved to find the new helen bernstein school would be the dragons
2882778 thats not too bad considering the history of this place

2882798 for the record i dont believe that the world trade center was brought down by our own explosives or that a rocket rather than an airliner hit the pentagon i spent a career in the cia trying to orchestrate plots wasnt all that good at it and certainly couldnt carry off 9 11 nor could the real pros i had the pleasure to work with
2882799 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2882800 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2882801 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2882802 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2882803 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2882804 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2882805 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2882806 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2882807 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2882808 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2882809 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2882810 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2882811 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2882812 these are the characters i hate these are the characters i like this is the fanservice blah blah blah

2882821 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2882822 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2882823 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2882824 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2882825 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2882826 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2882827 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2882828 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2882829 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2882830 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2882831 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2882832 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2882833 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2882834 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2882835 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2882836 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2882837 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2882838 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2882839 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2882840 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2882841 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2882842 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2882843 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2882844 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2882845 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2882846 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2882847 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2882848 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2882849 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2882850 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2882851 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2882852 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2882853 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2882854 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2882855 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2882856 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2882857 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2882858 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2882859 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2882860 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2882861 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2882862 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2882863 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2882864 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2882865 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on

2882895 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2882896 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2882897 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2882898 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2882899 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2882900 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2882901 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2882902 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2882903 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2882904 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2882905 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2882906 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2882907 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2882908 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2882909 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2882910 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2882911 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2882912 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2882913 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2882914 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2882915 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of

2882919 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2882920 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2882921 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2882922 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2882923 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2882924 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2882925 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2882926 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2882927 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2882928 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2882929 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2882930 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2882931 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2882932 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2882933 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2882934 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2882935 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2882936 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2882937 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2882938 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2882939 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2882940 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2882941 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2882942 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2882943 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm

2882946 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2882947 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2882948 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2882949 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2882950 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2882951 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2882952 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2882953 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2882954 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2882955 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

2882963 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
2882964 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
2882965 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
2882966 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq

2882969 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2882970 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
2882971 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2882972 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2882973 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2882974 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2882975 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2882976 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2882977 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2882978 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2882979 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2882980 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2882981 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2882982 in the time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
2882983 a prudent person foresees the danger ahead and takes precautions the simpleton goes blindly on and suffers the consequences
2882984 severe and sometimes incapacitating bone joint and or muscle musculoskeletal pain in patients taking bisphosphonates
2882985 may occur within days months or years after starting bisphosphonates some patients have reported complete relief of symptoms after discontinuing the bisphosphonate whereas others have reported slow or incomplete resolution
2882986 although good evidence suggests that many agents are effective in preventing osteoporotic fractures data are insufficient to determine the relative efficacy or safety of these agents
2882987 will not be used by the overwhelming majority of patients
2882988 why then would you stop taking bone pills if your doctor thought it was important for your health
2882989 knowing that about 95 of people wont take proactive steps to keep their bones healthy with weight bearing exercise and keeping off the pounds which intervention is now better
2882990 well you should try a little exercise but if you dont feel like it heres a wonderful drug sally field says she takes it and it works you could look just like her
2882991 you think thats a good enough reason for giving them poison drugs
2882992 since it is now clearly understood that excessive inflammation is part of the primary cause of every single disease of aging
2882993 the mainstream media doesnt cover this news and look heres an article on the bbcs webpage that proves my point

2882996 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2882997 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2882998 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2882999 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2883000 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2883001 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2883002 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2883003 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2883004 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2883005 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2883006 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2883007 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2883008 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2883009 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2883010 just so you all know we did set a record
2883011 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2883012 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2883013 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2883014 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2883015 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2883016 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2883017 if every american were to pitch in 2 000 we could pay off this years deficit or if we handed over each of us 500 gallons of gasoline or in terms we could all really understand if every american gave up 666 lattes for a year we could pay off this years deficit
2883018 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
2883019 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
2883020 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
2883021 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
2883022 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
2883023 however you feel about her politics i feel that received some of the most unfair hostile coverage ive ever seen
2883024 if theres anything we need to rescue us from the last eight years its brains good judgment and experience obama has the first two gore has all three
2883025 i have fundamental differences with on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
2883026 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
2883027 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
2883028 i knew ronald reagan ronald reagan was a friend of mine barack obama is no ronald reagan
2883029 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
2883030 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
2883031 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
2883032 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2883033 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2883034 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2883035 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2883036 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2883037 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2883038 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2883039 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2883040 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2883041 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2883042 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2883043 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2883044 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2883045 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2883046 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2883047 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2883048 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2883049 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2883050 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2883051 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2883052 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2883053 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2883054 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2883055 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2883056 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2883057 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2883058 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2883059 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2883060 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2883061 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2883062 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2883063 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2883064 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2883065 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2883066 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2883067 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2883068 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2883069 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2883070 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2883071 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2883072 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2883073 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2883074 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2883075 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2883076 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2883077 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2883078 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2883079 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2883080 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2883081 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2883082 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2883083 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2883084 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2883085 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2883086 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2883087 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2883088 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2883089 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
2883090 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
2883091 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
2883092 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
2883093 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2883094 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2883095 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2883096 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2883097 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2883098 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2883099 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2883100 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2883101 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2883102 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2883103 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2883104 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2883105 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2883106 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2883107 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2883108 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2883109 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2883110 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2883111 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2883112 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2883113 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2883114 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2883115 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2883116 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2883117 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2883118 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2883119 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2883120 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2883121 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2883122 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2883123 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2883124 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2883125 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2883126 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2883127 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2883128 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2883129 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2883130 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2883131 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2883132 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2883133 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2883134 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2883135 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2883136 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2883137 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2883138 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2883139 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2883140 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2883141 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2883142 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2883143 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2883144 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2883145 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2883146 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2883147 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2883148 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2883149 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2883150 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2883151 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2883152 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2883153 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2883154 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2883155 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2883156 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2883157 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2883158 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2883159 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2883160 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2883161 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2883162 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2883163 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2883164 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2883165 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2883166 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2883167 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2883168 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2883169 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2883170 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2883171 em certas zonas de responsabilidade dos soldados russos de manuten o da paz perto de tsjhinvali havia confrontos ativos na madrugada de domingo para segunda feira

2883173 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

2883240 el balance de esta semana en galicia creo que es francamente positivo hemos estado muy bien atendidos en el hotel villamart n y aunque tuvimos un peque o problemilla al principio con el campo de la magdalena se solvent enseguida adem s los desplazamientos a ferrol han sido cortos y c modos la actitud y la predisposici n al trabajo de la plantilla es de agradecer todo el mundo pone los cinco sentidos en todo lo nuevo que estamos trabajando creo que vamos por el buen camino estoy muy contento de c mo llevamos el proceso
2883241 las lesiones que hemos tenido son lo peor de estos d as es algo que siempre dificulta la preparaci n pero sobre todo merman las posibilidades de coger el momento de forma lo antes posible para estos futbolistas casos de chus luccin o coentrao
2883242 habr que ver en las pr ximas horas la gravedad que tienen las ltimas lesiones de gabi ewerthon pablo de barros y zapater a los que se har n pruebas el lunes o el martes pero en principio parece ser que puede ser menos de lo previsto inicialmente tras el partido contra el sporting
2883243 considero que estamos mejor de lo que han estado conmigo otros equipos a mi llegada recreativo y racing de santander bastante mejor los resultados por ejemplo son much simo mejores y el juego aun sin continuidad es tambi n superior al que dieron mis anteriores equipos al principio
2883244 como es l gico hay mucha irregularidad a la hora de aplicar los conceptos y el criterio que vamos a utilizar esta temporada que no es ni mejor ni peor que el anterior pero es muy diferente al que se ven a haciendo en este equipo pero insisto para m es l gico que ocurra esta irregularidad
2883245 hace falta la colaboraci n de todos los jugadores para poder aplicar tantos cambios y eso dificulta la continuidad adem s hay mucho cansancio acumulado en esta fase de preparaci n por ello hay tanta irregularidad
2883246 es normal que nos est costando jugar con cierta soltura porque nosotros este a o no vamos a ser un equipo que tenga posesiones muy largas no vamos a ser un equipo de toque toque y toque que acabe mareando la perdiz no vamos a ser m s ese equipo seremos diferentes mucho m s r pidos y directos ahora mismo tenemos otra idea finalizar las acciones en ataque o contraataque con los menos toques posibles
2883247 este a o si podemos acabar jugadas en cinco pases no las vamos a acabar en cincuenta y por eso veo normal que est costando bastante a la gente entender este tipo de juego no es lo mismo robar el bal n y dar un pase atr s para iniciar el juego desde la l nea defensiva que robar e iniciar inmediatamente el contraataque tampoco es lo mismo hacer tres rotaciones de bal n por atr s para progresar poco a poco en ataque si a la primera rotaci n ya es posible salir r pido hacia arriba mi criterio es diferente y por eso perdono la irregularidad y el juego exhibido hasta ahora
2883248 el a o pasado cuando nos enfrentamos varias veces dije que al zaragoza le hab a faltado comportarse como un equipo de forma regular a lo largo de la temporada ltima fue equipo a veces pero en muchas ocasiones no lo fue cuando funcionaron como equipo normalmente ganaron los partidos gracias a la calidad de los hombres que tiene
2883249 por eso este a o tenemos que ser un equipo todos part cipes de lo mismo no puede ser como pas a os atr s que unos jugadores solo est n para unas facetas del juego y otros se dediquen nicamente a las otras
2883250 el hecho de no tener hombres espec ficos de banda es un condicionante que influye claramente en el juego tanto a la hora de atacar como a la de defender
2883251 y tambi n es un condicionante para poder aplicar aquello que estamos ensayando con el equipo que pueda empezar la competici n de la mejor manera posible
2883252 lo que condiciona el asunto de las salidas y las llegadas de futbolistas est ah y es evidente y eso nos va a suponer que vamos a tener unas dificultades mayores en el inicio de la liga
2883253 hay que ver qu soluciones vamos adoptando ya con la plantilla lo que est claro es que tenemos que hacer un equipo competitivo en el que cualquier futbolista pueda participar y el equipo no se resienta con los que hay ahora lo que estamos haciendo es generar unos h bitos pero hay que definir ya la plantilla para empezar el campeonato de la mejor manera
2883254 no estoy cabreado por c mo va el asunto de las salidas y fichajes lo estar a si se hubieran marchado dos o tres delanteros entonces aunque me hubieran venido las bandas estar a muy cabreado estoy tranquilo porque ya tenemos algunas cosas aseguradas y lo otro creo que lo vamos a tener eso es lo que creo
2883255 estamos buscando soluciones que si conseguimos que vengan van a elevar bastante el nivel del equipo creo que de aqu al mi rcoles va a haber alguna novedad importante cuando volvamos a entrenar este mi rcoles me parece que tendremos noticias
2883256 est claro que tiene que venir un portero todos sabemos que hay una opci n que nos gusta much simo asenjo y hay que ver si se puede realizar o no si al final no es posible habr otra soluci n
2883257 tendremos que valorar qu hacemos si fichar un portero para varias temporadas o buscar una soluci n nicamente para este a o pr ximo ah habr que ver qu nos ofrece el mercado y viendo el perfil de lo que nos d decidiremos lo que nos parezca mejor
2883258 ante las equivocaciones de un jugador en un momento dado yo soy un entrenador y una persona que tomo decisiones que creo oportunas pero despu s para que haya un rencor o determine que no voy a contar con un futbolista tiene que haber una gravedad considerable que adem s se repita
2883259 el tema de la expulsi n de sergio garc a de un entrenamiento no lo considero grave fue una soluci n puntual tras una discusi n pero a m sergio me parece un grand simo futbolista y en lo que llevo trat ndolo me parece una gran persona y mi valoraci n no se mediatiza tras lo que ocurri la semana pasada
2883260 lo que pas con sergio no tiene para m ninguna secuela lo que pas ah se queda
2883261 me ha demostrado que es un futbolista con muchas posibilidades y lo ha hecho en poco tiempo teniendo en cuenta adem s que tiene 20 a itos y que llega de brasil pero tiene muchas ganas y tiene maneras ahora bien en su caso nos limita mucho el asunto de los extracomunitarios ya veremos
2883262 ewerthon era un futbolista que como ya dije no contaba con l e incluso le notifiqu al club que pod a salir sin problemas pero luego me ha demostrado con su trabajo que es un jugador que puede estar perfectamente en la plantilla ahora su salida del equipo va a depender de que en un momento puntual el club y l decidan que tiene que irse siempre y cuando el equipo no quede mermado en el apartado ofensivo claro
2883263 mi idea es quedarme con cuatro delanteros que haya una gran competitividad entre ellos y que cada d a jueguen dos ya veremos al final lo que sucede y lo que m s conviene a todos
2883264 i know you i have seen you here a million times a million versions of you the guy who thinks hes better than the rest of them the one who thinks he doesnt need this program the one who watches the clock just counting his time but guess what buddy you are the worst of them all because i see here that you have two small children do you realize that every single time you drink every single time you light up and get high you are throwing those two babies in the garbage can wow you are so big and tough arent you what a man you are yeh you dont need anyone do you you can control your drinking and drugs look where it has got you so far
2883265 he has been hugely influential on the rap movement as both a spoken word pioneer and larger than life persona whos influenced everyone from barry white to puff daddy
2883266 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2883267 i want to wrap this up its been 15 years im ready to get it over with one way or the other i dont care what the outcome is i just want the attorneys to do their business so i can do mine
2883268 echoes with the disturbing and wonderful magic of a true storyteller
2883269 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2883270 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2883271 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2883272 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2883273 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2883274 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
2883275 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness
2883276 executives realize that if employees are stressed out financially have excess debt it really makes them less productive
2883277 theres a real financial benefit to the company a long term financial benefit for their employees to be on track for retirement and financially fit
2883278 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2883279 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2883280 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2883281 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2883282 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2883283 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2883284 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2883285 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2883286 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2883287 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2883288 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2883289 we expect to have more people attending than the 800 to 900 who came last year
2883290 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
2883291 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2883292 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2883293 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything
2883294 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2883295 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2883296 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2883297 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2883298 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2883299 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2883300 lifted 95kg in the snatch and 117kg in the clean and jerk to set a games record for the latter and for the total weight of 212kg
2883301 i saw a chinese girl who weighs as much as i do lift 117 kg thats inspirational
2883302 the hospital auxiliary has long been dear to my heart
2883303 my mother was a charter member i went to church and school with several current members and many were role models for me as i grew up individually and collectively its members have been the driving force behind projects that have enhanced our lives for over half a century
2883304 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics

2883306 its all about experience and getting into position to see what it feels like
2883307 but one bad shot at the wrong time can scare you they are all young and they have to come back better prepared majors test every nerve ending in your body
2883308 they have to get rid of that voice of doubt in their minds you need the self confidence and the bottle and you have to hit the millions of balls you have to hit to think you deserve success whether this group actually has it or not remains to be seen they certainly have talent and they are getting into position now it is down to their determination to succeed
2883309 theres guys who get a little bit fortunate in majors
2883310 they manage to get things going their way unfortunately it hasnt happened to me
2883311 that doesnt mean im not on the right track im looking forward to the challenge its just a matter of time
2883312 it seems like every year the majors are getting harder and harder
2883313 this year we have played in a lot of wind almost every week even a normal week on the tour we have played in a lot of wind
2883314 the open championship had winds stronger than the others and then weve had it tough again this week as well
2883315 i would definitely say this year is the toughest set of majors ive ever played
2883316 the brands that we do business with are used to buying content
2883317 they value the context and they understand the price you have to pay for that
2883318 really being able to target in a much more nuanced way
2883319 in the beginning when we launched them we really had to position them as brands in the marketplace
2883320 these brands are household names and are well known by people who buy media as well
2883321 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2883322 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2883323 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2883324 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2883325 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2883326 we are still planning to trial the technology but have not started doing so yet we are currently working on some things before we can begin but are expecting the trials to commence soon
2883327 we are looking for a network based opt out solution instead of one using cookies but this is not holding up the trial
2883328 there are other things we are working through its a separate issue
2883329 a banner ad is placed on the page and the users can mouse over the ad and up will pop the lawyers profile information including information about the firm its attorneys where its offices are located some history and the types of cases they handle
2883330 i am not practicing law and i am not involved in any of that that is between the client and the attorney
2883331 certainly we are going to do seo and sem we are going to do significant television radio and outdoor ad campaigns focusing on target markets at first and hopefully growing it into a national ad campaign wed like to become the lending tree of legal services
2883332 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2883333 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2883334 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2883335 one of the big concerns from bloggers is that the money in this model presents possible bias and that your readers will not want to feel monetized thanks to open and sharing people like ck we decided to make donating to charity a way to shed this concern now you can give any of the earnings to a good cause avoid bias and increase the features within your posts

2883373 kami menuntut sebuah negara islam dan bukan semacam islamisasi masyarakat kami ingin agar negara menjadi islami dgn pemimpin2 islam yg memiliki keberanian dan akan memberlakukan shariah sepenuhnya tidak ada jalan lain
2883374 kami ingin sebuah negara islam dimana hukum islam tidak hanya teori dlm buku2 tetapi juga diberlakukan dan diberlakukan dgn kepastian
2883375 saat ini kami sedang merancang perubahan uud kami sendiri bagi indonesia sebuah kerangka bagi negara islam indonesia dimana diberlakukan syariah rakyat indonesia harus mengerti bahwa tidak akan ada sebuah negara islam tanpa pemberlakuan hukum2 islam kalau gitu sih namanya cuma ngomong saja tidak lain daripada itu
2883376 pemimpin2 kami semuanya sudah dilatih agar berbicara sesuai dgn apa yg diinginkan boss2 barat mereka
2883377 menjadi radikal bukan sesuatu yg buruk setiap gerakan perubahan selalu radikal
2883378 kini kekuatan2 dan media barat ingin menjinakkan kami spt domba
2883379 untuk itu mereka mencap kami radikal utk menakut2i kami dan mengkontrol kami begitulah pemimpin2 kami yg semuanya sudah dijinakkan dan dilatih utk berbicara sesuai dgn boss2 mereka di barat
2883380 barat mencoba melemahkan islam dari luar dan dari dalam mereka menyerang orang2 kami dan menginvasi negara2 kami dari luar dan melemahkan kami dari dari dalam dgn gagasan2 spt sekularisme liberalisme dan demokrasi ini semua dirancang utk meracuni islam murni kami
2883381 tidak ada satupun pemimpin muslim yg memiliki keberanian dan komitmen utk membela islam dan muslims mereka semua terakgum2 dgn as dan kekuatan2 barat dan mereka berhutang pada barat nabi kami memperingatkan akan terjadinya masa depan ini umat muslim kuat dari segi jumlah tetapi lemah dalam semangat mereka
2883382 orang yahudi licik dan tidak dapat dipercaya demikian dikatakan dalam quran pada saat ini as hanya keledainya israel yg sebenarnya mengontrol as
2883383 bgm kami bisa berdialog dlm dunia arab selama israel masih eksis
2883384 tidak ada satupun negara islam di dunia bahkan saudipun bukan negara islam orang2 saudi munafik teman2 as pemimpin2 mereka semuanya korup dan suka materi negara yg paling mirip sebuah negara islam adalah pemeritah taleban di afghanistan
2883385 adalah kewajiban muslim utk menantang pemerintah2 mereka ketika pemimpin mereka berdialog dgn musuh2 kami
2883386 quran sudah memiliki segala pengarahan peraturan norma hukum dan hukuman yg kami perlukan
2883387 kalau nabipun bisa membawa tombak maka kami bisa membawa m 16
2883388 lihatlah pada sunnah nabi saat ia berpidato dan berkotbah ia selalu memegang tombak mengapa karena itu adalah lambang kekuasaan pengikutnya tahu ia serius dan bukan hanya sekedar omong kosong ia benar2 melakukan apa yg katanya akan dilakukannya
2883389 sedihnya berabad2 kemudian islam menjadi semakin lemah dan kami lupa bahwa nabi membawa tombak setiap kali ia berbicara tombak itu kemudian diganti dgn tongkat seakan2 muslim begitu lemah dan perlu alat penopang utk berdiri kami perlu kembali ke islam yg orijinal kuat dan tahan banting spt nabi kami harus kembali memegang tombak jika nabi saja membawa tombak maka kami saat ini bisa membawa sebuah senapan m 16
2883390 tidak ada demokrasi dlm islam jadi jangan mencoba menginterpretasi quran dan menjadikan islam sebuah demokrasi utk memenuhi keingingan dirimu
2883391 prinsip islam tidak bisa dirubah dan tidak ada demokrasi dalam islam atau omong kosong spt islam demokratik
2883392 kemenangan islam datang hanya lewat dakwah dan jihad dan bukan lewat pemilu itulah mengapa partai2 islam berada pada jalan yg keliru selama mereka memilih demokrasi hasil akhirnya adalah haram tidak ada yg baik yg dapat dihasilkan sesuatu yg haram begitu bukan jadi jika demokrasi haram negara islam macam apa yg bisa dihasilkan darinya jelas bukan sebuah negara islam yg murni pemilu2 sebenarnya tidak ada gunanya sama sekali
2883393 perjuangan bagi islam hanya datang lewat krisis dan konfrontasi islam datang utk merubah dunia tidak utk dirubah oleh dunia jadi oleh karena itulah ada perlawanan itulah mengapa barat takut pada kita
2883394 kalau kami menerima norma2 barat spt demokrasi maka kami tidak akan pernah bisa mencapai allah krasi yg saya sebut tadi demokrasi harus diganti oleh allah krasi dan ini tidak bisa datang dari pemilu
2883395 inilah sudut pandang islam kami tidak boleh berkompromi menyerah mengalah dan tunduk pada musuh2 kafir kami kami harus selalu berada pada jalan islam jihad dalam nama shariah dan jangan pernah meminta maaf
2883396 ingat bahwa jihadlah yg membawa islam pada kekuasaan dan membangun masyarakat kami tidak akan ada islam tanpa jihad
2883397 his last 50 meters were absolutely incredible he had a perfect finish
2883398 its going to be one of the strongest linebacking corps in the middle with him and patrick
2883399 great guy as far as football goes hes just a leader hes got that quality about him he knows his stuff he pays attention to his film study hes prepared hes the type of guy you need on a defense thats a plus
2883400 i think the biggest thing is weve gotten better since then from a personnel standpoint
2883401 obviously with patrick willis inside that exposes the guys next to him a lot
2883402 i think it showed some glimpses of what i can do
2883403 im still learning the defense it was a solid game

2883405 youve still got to have some down time in camp but every time i have 15 minutes if im not studying i feel like im cheating myself
2883406 at some point like i did last night im looking at the playbook and im just staring at it i got to put it up
2883407 ive always felt like in any offense or defense throughout the nfl theres too much volume
2883408 the coaches have way too much free time you dont have to have 1 000 plays to be successful you have to run five or 10 of them very well bottom line is you run 70 plays in a game you repeat half of those well condense it down theyre throwing everything at me right now
2883409 like in a game he pumped and laid it in there before the safety got over there

2883425 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals
2883426 the catholic church is the only thing which saves a man from the degrading slavery of being a child of his age

2883431 i was punching in my door combo when he came up to me and asked me for help with his e mail
2883432 so i go to his room and im setting up his uf campus account and i start to notice all this weird stuff on his walls like this cross on his bulletin board and this poster that said i am the light and the world or something

2883441 you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an abomination
2883442 if there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman both of them have committed a detestable act they shall surely be put to death their bloodguiltness is upon them
2883443 or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals 10 nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of god
2883444 for this reason god gave them over to degrading passions for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural 27 and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error 28 and just as they did not see fit to acknowledge god any longer god gave them over to a depraved mind to do those things which are not proper

2883446 the size and discount of that type of deal isnt the norm yet
2883447 the critical mass of bulk reo is in well capitalized institutions that dont need to sell yet in bulk at a deep discount because they are better off not taking substantial hits to the capital just to get the assets off their books
2883448 this type of bulk buy would make an impact on the market they are in a unique position because they have a long time horizon to invest and a cheap cost of capital its actually a perfect time for them to acquire these reo assets

2883481 inilah perbuatan beberapa imam yang menunjukkan bahwa mereka menganggap tidak bolehnya mengambil ilmu secara wijadah membaca sendiri karena tulisan kadang berubah ditangan penukil dan mungkin bertambah satu huruf sehingga merubah makna adapun sekarang kebohongan telah tersebar sedikit orang yang mau belajar dien lewat mulut para guru dan juga dari buku buku yang tidak ada kesalahannya bahkan sebagian penukil kitab terkadang tidak bisa mengeja dengan baik
2883482 beberapa ahli hadits telah mewasiatkan agar buku bukunya dipendam dibakar atau dicuci dilunturkan tintanya karena takut buku tersebut dipegang oleh muhaddits yang kurang agamanya kemudian ia akan merubah rubah dan menambahinya kemudian hal itu dinisbatkan kepada al hafidz ahli hadits pemilik kitab atau didalam kitab itu terdapat riwayat yang putus atau lemah yang tidak pernah ia ceritakan sedangkan yang telah ia riwayatkan adalah hal hal yang telah dipilih maka ia pada akhirnya membenci hasil tulisannya dan tidak ada jalan lain kecuali harus dimusnahkan karena hal ini dan lainnya ia memendam buku bukunya
2883483 buku buku yang penuh dengan racun kalajengking dan ular yang berisi kejelakan dan kemungkaran lebih layak untuk dipendam dimusnahkan dan dibakar
2883484 aku tidak menganggapnya sebagai karya beliau buku ini hanyalah dinisbatkan secara dusta
2883485 kemudian aku menelaah buku tersebut maka aku temukan buku tersebut berisi kekufuran yang nyata maka aku perintahkan supaya kedua buku itu dibakar dengan api dan apinya digunakan untuk membuat roti untukku

2883508 lied throughout the past one and a half or two years
2883509 this is not the first such case during the preparatory period last year many editorial departments received documents purportedly from the finance ministry which contained disinformation
2883510 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
2883511 currently aggregate demand has been growing in a stable manner the relationship between supply and demand is fairly balanced and competition in the market for finished products is very tough
2883512 so it will be hard for factory gate inflation which is being driven up by resource costs to pass through quickly to consumer prices
2883513 our assessment is that the inflation rate remains high but we are much less worried about the outlook inflation is coming off and oil prices are coming down
2883514 producers profit margins are being squeezed sharply and even though tough market competition will delay the pass through to retail prices it will happen eventually
2883515 do you avoid looking in the mirror for fear of what youll see
2883516 it is an insult for the portuguese to be governed by socrates
2883517 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs what we need today is an economic surge our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and to create new ones
2883518 gerb should at least read the constitution the president cannot interfere when there is no parliamentary crisis this is an appeal to violate the constitution

2883521 for all his exploits bill was basically a quiet man more comfortable in the background
2883522 im told he went 2 for 4 against bob feller in the navy
2883523 and they tell me that at bc high in a game against malden catholic he hit a ball over a triple decker behind the left field fence
2883524 my first year in seminary was his last and i remember delivering mail to him on his ordination retreat one of the letters came from the
2883525 when he died last week much was said about him as an athlete
2883526 that was certainly part of his history but the priesthood was his soul his passion the essence of his being the man we buried saturday was so much more than a wonderful athlete above all he was a good and faithful priest
2883527 it was at st francis in weymouth his first assignment
2883528 when i saw his name there i thought gee ill pop in to say hello so we were standing outside when this little kid came up to him and asked father is it true you could have been in the big leagues bill looked down at him and said son i am in the big leagues
2883529 for bill to be a priest in the archdiocese of boston was to be in the big leagues
2883530 he experienced the glory days of the priesthood here in boston
2883531 i came out of holy name parish in west roxbury when i decided to become a priest it not only made my family proud but all the guys and gals in my crowd were proud too knowing one of their own was going into the seminary
2883532 that was the same culture bill came from over at st williams in dorchester that parish was proud of him until his dying day in fact a lot of those old parishioners were at his funeral

2883539 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
2883540 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2883541 we expect to have more people attending than the 800 to 900 who came last year
2883542 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2883543 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it

2883549 these olympics represent the culmination of 30 years of profound change and a further step toward chinas goal of a harmonious society
2883550 our study is the first to specifically examine psa screening in younger men which provides an important assessment of quality of care especially for high risk groups
2883551 further investigation will be required to understand the impact of new risk stratification strategies with particular focus on the policy implications of potentially large increases in health care resource use

2883553 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2883554 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2883555 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2883556 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2883557 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2883558 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2883559 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2883560 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2883561 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2883562 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2883563 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2883564 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
2883565 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
2883566 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
2883567 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
2883568 weve been encouraging black men to get screened at age 40 or 45 for more than a decade yet only one third of these high risk men reported being tested
2883569 our findings provide an important baseline assessment of psa test use among young men as physicians debate whether to expand use of the psa test in young men with risk stratification strategies
2883570 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
2883571 the times they are a changin marital status and health differentials from 1972 to 2003
2883572 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
2883573 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
2883574 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided

2883582 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2883583 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2883584 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2883585 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2883586 i was watching on television you approached it aggressively and won a gold medal and i was very happy fukuda was quoted as telling uchishiba over the phone a day after he defeated benjamin darbelet of france in the mens 66 kilogram judo final to defend his olympic title

2883598 were going to get there because now we are knocking on the door we have a long ways to go but i think we are starting to win the little victories we starting to eat away at how far behind we were i think we are getting there
2883599 athens was kind of a wake up call and everybody knew we can do better
2883600 thats been our goal for the last four years we are doing what we were prepared for
2883601 this is the tiger woods of swimming he is a superstar one of a kind he makes everyone else better by going after him
2883602 he has a lot of races left there is somebody gearing up just to beat him every single day it will be exciting to watch him swim for the rest of the week
2883603 it doesnt change the race that much its just everybody is using a little bit better technology it might improve all the times a little bit more but the race is still the same

2883605 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2883606 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2883607 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2883608 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2883609 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2883610 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2883611 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2883612 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2883613 this motherhood of mary in the order of grace continues uninterruptedly from the consent which she loyally gave at the annunciation and which she sustained without wavering beneath the cross until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect taken up to heaven she did not lay aside this saving office but by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation therefore the blessed virgin is invoked in the church under the titles of advocate helper benefactress and mediatrix

2883711 as always i wont say much about repertoire until the album is well into post production but i will say that the album was inspired by a road trip philip and i took in may of 2006 from new york to savannah we were tossing around ideas for his next album during the drive south then while in savannah we took a carriage tour that stopped at johnny mercers gravesite and i guess the idea for the album and the feel sort of crystallized there as the title suggests it takes its cue from philips southern roots but in unexpected ways it took us a couple years after that road trip to figure out exactly how to say what we wanted to say and as always happens when philip and i work on an album the repertoire is a mix of the known and the little known the theatre songs include selections by harold arlen jerry herman burton lane frank loesser plus fittingly a couple of johnny mercer tracks

2883774 timing a prestigious sporting event gives real credibility to our brand
2883775 its my feeling that the city has abandoned us its very discouraging to those of us who are trying to make a difference
2883776 i didnt know the severity of the damage until the next morning in the daylight
2883777 and yet it seems the citys busier helping north shore development the stadium authority sells a property to the steelers for 1 3 million when its worth close to 10 million almost a 9 million difference thats almost 9 million that could help neighborhoods i know its not just that simple but its a signal
2883778 i wanted to be part of this community and i feel i am supposed to be here
2883779 i felt the heat and called back and said im in danger
2883780 it just feels like were a scene of fires to the city
2883781 but theres a bigger picture that were trying hard to change
2883782 i dont know why i just know i have to do this
2883783 man i dont know how spike can handle her all the time
2883784 it shouldn t have really done anything to her the spell was just to close the rift
2883785 okay but isnt dawn like this big dimensional key thing
2883786 think maybe being hit by the spell activated or deactivated something
2883787 miss summers i dont give extensions its stated very clearly in the syllabus if you bothered at all to read it which i doubt given how ive yet to see you open a book or take any notes this class is not easy but it isnt so hard that you couldnt do well if you tried but you dont try you dont do anything im not sure what you expect but youth and looks will only get you so far if you want to succeed in not only this class but in life in general you have to put some effort in it
2883788 if you want to drop the class there is still time to do so without it affecting your grade point average
2883789 i dont give buys you have to do the work if you want to pass end of story
2883790 shes one of my students i might have been a little mean to her today
2883791 as i was going to tell you before you so rudely interrupted and then went off on me i am going out of town next week for a wedding this is my report written in medieval greek i wanted to turn it in early
2883792 this is the same report written in modern greek in case the other is a little too hard for you
2883793 and just in case you cant read greek at all here it is again in latin
2883794 and in case those are all out of your grasp i dumbed it down for you in english
2883795 ive seen women swoon at your presence but im pretty sure shes the first one ive seen actually pass out
2883796 shouldnt you have caught her before she knocked herself out
2883797 over tall dark and gorgeous okay hes cute and all but swoon nada
2883798 like a puppy only youre not too puppy like are you hmm well anyways who the hell are you
2883799 see insert hand and say your name then we shake hands usually rather gently unless youre trying to impress or scare me with your masculinity which by the way wont work then you can squeeze it all hard and that sounds so much dirtier out loud than it did in my head
2883800 well i was hoping i was kidnapped or something not that i passed out in the middle of my big scene
2883801 i was supposed to storm off and leave you feeling all bad and shocked that you were such a butthead nowhere in the script did it say that i would run into a wall disguised as a man and knock myself out so can we just go back to you with your mouth open and me walking out in a blaze of glory
2883802 when you say miss summers it always makes me think im in trouble i get you have to be all professional in class but i think with the knocking out you can call me by my first name
2883803 and im not sure im not still mad at you
2883804 you took one look at me and decided im a stupid airhead teenager that uses her boobs and ass to get by in life
2883805 and that fact that youre always late never take notes and sleep during class didnt help in that assumption
2883806 okay if you want to get all technical about it
2883807 but in my defense your class is just a cake class for me so theres no reason for me to actually pay attention
2883808 oh that probably wasnt the nicest thing to say to my teacher
2883809 im not saying that your class isnt interesting it would really be so if i didnt already know everything youre teaching and i don t sleep i just rest my eyes
2883810 its your own fault who in their right mind has a class at seven in the morning
2883811 val commented on her brash and loud exterior and she made fun of his girly hair
2883812 i lived in rome for six months when i was sixteen
2883813 reading and writing somewhat i was teaching myself but i slacked off when i moved here
2883814 okay maybe i should attempt to be on time and pay attention in fact ill make it a goal or something and i might have overreacted with the whole translating thing but i was just trying to prove that im not some air headed teenager
2883815 and i wont see you next week cuz of the wedding thing but ill be back for class the week after that
2883816 ill give it my best shot but i promise nothing
2883817 oh your teaching assistant told me you always go out to eat at that caf on fridays
2883818 okay well sorry for breaking up your dinner with my spaz attack
2883819 gee thats generally what happens when the sun sets i promise you the world isnt going to end because its dark out like little orphan annie said the sun will come out tomorrow
2883820 that if she bothered to read the syllabus she would have known that and that her looks and youth would only get her so far if she wanted to succeed in life she has to actually put some effort into it
2883821 ive never seen her open a book or take a note
2883822 as close to accurate as someone who wasnt actually there can get
2883823 and she even included some things ive said in class that differ from what history books say
2883824 what are the chances that the daimons are going to attack her
2883825 the only time to eat diet food is while youre waiting for the steak to cook
2883826 every time we ran a trip we picked up 450 patients from first aid stations field hospitals off the roads or in fields and escorted them back to a port

2883828 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat

2883832 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2883833 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2883834 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2883835 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2883836 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2883837 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2883838 we expect to have more people attending than the 800 to 900 who came last year
2883839 my god i can see them saying we shall put a player piano in a torpedo
2883840 all she has to do is stand still and look stupid
2883841 there used to be lots of petty stealing but its much better now and the gipsies who were camped around here have gone thank god
2883842 before things change you have to have a dead body
2883843 but it wont be so bad if we get into a new era of discipline
2883844 all our problems come from foreigners getting drunk smashing windows and stealing
2883845 mussolini had his positive side the streets were safe in his day
2883846 send them to the country or send them somewhere they are dirty and there are lots of problems with burglary and thieving they make toxic smoke
2883847 i dont like the police outside our camp or the military presence on our streets
2883848 there is some petty crime committed by gipsies because our people are poor but we are not all criminals
2883849 the leftists arent able to understand this fear of crime because they have an ideological prejudice against law and order
2883850 these things were done in the fascist days when gipsies were killed or sent to concentration camps
2883851 the politicians should remember that we are human not garbage
2883852 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2883853 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2883854 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2883855 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2883856 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2883857 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2883858 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2883859 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease

2883861 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2883862 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything
2883863 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2883864 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2883865 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2883866 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2883867 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2883868 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2883869 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2883870 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2883871 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2883872 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2883873 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2883874 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics
2883875 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
2883876 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2883877 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind
2883878 theres some weird stuff with the scheduling with other pirates affiliates
2883879 its a step to getting back to playing in a big league game
2883880 i didnt want hansen to get thrown out of the game
2883881 first time in my career i had trouble throwing strikes
2883882 id pitched from the first base side my whole career
2883883 hes pitched his way into a situation where hes a valuable part of our bullpen
2883884 we feel pretty happy about what hes doing in this role
2883885 he was always a workhorse back then as far as conditioning and making sure he took care of himself he always had a very resilient arm and he was always a student of the game it just seemed he would teach himself how to pitch year after year after year
2883886 because of the things he does obviously at some point for everybody mother nature will take its course but if anybody could do it i dont see why he couldnt
2883887 he was being aggressive he wanted to get it too
2883888 and then doumit stepped on my foot when i went to throw
2883889 randy was right in front of me and i was like oh hi
2883890 i tried to grab him but i think i ended up pushing him
2883891 they had the oxygen tank at third i felt like i was in little league
2883892 i was just trying to hit the ball hard just put the ball in play
2883893 not taking anything away from jason but its no secret and its a nice thing to be able to say because we havent been able to say this all year we have some options at class aaa indianapolis
2883894 but he has the pitches to be a starter he has the velocity its a good opportunity for him
2883895 you hate those cycles when you pitch well but dont score or you score but you dont pitch well
2883896 youd like to put them together at the same time
2883897 the kennedy family is once again in the publics mind as the world rallies to support ted kennedy during his recent health issues and commemorates the tragic assassination of his brother
2883898 we have one foot in the wild and wooly west and one foot in a burgeoning western metropolis
2883899 the people of denver by popular vote commanded the erection of this building
2883900 denver was a city run by city bosses really from the 1880s through mayor ben stapleton which means in the 1940s
2883901 whatever you can say about it mayors could get things done the price was it was not a very democratic way of doing business
2883902 a lot of the real decisions were not made in the convention but at the brown palace and at the albany hotel
2883903 its difficult to underestimate the significance of smoke filled rooms in making political decisions

2883906 do you think i can get past security and just sneak up here on my own sometime
2883907 everyone here has been saying i cant believe you actually own the dress youre wearing but why wouldnt i want to
2883908 i called him and said i bought boots and a dress but im pretty sure he didnt hear that last part
2883909 oh yeah i was a hippie long hair on the lower east side
2883910 ik was toch wel nerveuzer en vooral minder geconcentreerd dan gisteren
2883911 misschien omdat het gisteren vooral moest gebeuren mijn start was ook trager ik had wat schrik om zo hard te vertrekken als gisteren het heeft een tijd geduurd voor ik in slaap geraakte en om half twaalf kwam gaelle mys dan binnen en hebben we wat gepraat nu op naar de 200m ik sta 24ste op de ranking we zullen zien wat dat geeft er zit alleszins meer tijd tussen mijn 100m en 200m dan op het ek in eindhoven slechter dan toen kan niet

2883920 i live to play the last nine holes of a major championship
2883921 i love it so much i am disappointed that the next major championship is eight months away
2883922 id been drawn against him so many times before in the first round i just knew god would be on my side this time
2883923 drawing him again i knew god was testing me this time i brought my performance with me i could have boxed better but there were my tactics to beat him round by round
2883924 hes been my bogeyman my goal here was to bring my fight to him and as the fight went on i got more and more confident hes a big banger but i let him chase me that was the plan
2883925 i said to johnny yesterday that if this guy beats you again hes going to bring you home and put you on the mantelpiece
2883926 i know now as the tournament goes on the better ill get especially after beating him the way i did
2883927 they all must have got tickets at the last minute my father two brothers and a lot of their mates its a great stadium and the atmosphere is savage but once youre in there all you see is your opponent and four ropes

2883937 i fear not the creatures of chaos klausenberg for sigmar protects me and his son i pray that he hath no mercy on your lost soul
2883938 there is work yet to be done here child there is a tall man who looks much like me outside send him in and stay outside
2883939 you let the child live he too could be corrupted captain
2883940 you doubt what ive done here von karstein you being a simple apprentice and me being the captain of our chapter house how dare you you insolent worm
2883941 apprentice von karstein you have been training with me for many years now and i do believe that you are ready to carry the title of witch hunter is it within your power to accept and carry out the duties that a templar of sigmar would be oath bound to do
2883942 it was an honor to have you as my apprentice brother i do hope that you will remember what i have taught you all the while forging your own path in the name of sigmar
2883943 ah viktor i do hope you are enjoying those books as if youve ever plan to go anywhere with your life youre going to have to learn and learn well
2883944 heinrik was appointed the title of witch hunter today you should congratulate him
2883945 i dont like heinrik i dont like anyone here i just want to go home but to i cant you destroyed it
2883946 what was destroyed needed to be destroyed there was nothing you nor i could have done about the situation you should be glad that sigmar had prevented you from meeting the same end

2883950 this is a static display and this is a way we can interact with the local community and show them what we do in the marine corps we do this a couple of times a month we have a pretty big presence in the local community and we like doing this to show them were out there
2883951 we are pleased to establish this relationship with the producers of the worlds single engine piston performance leaders
2883952 general aviation is growing throughout latin america and we anticipate enthusiastic interest in mooney throughout this region mooneys have always been great airplanes people fall in love with them and their speed it really is amazing to go faster than piston twins in a single engine airplane but thats what a mooney can do and it has incredible range too its an ideal airplane for the caribbean region because our average trips are about 500 miles thats how far it is to go from venezuela to the islands with a mooney we can accomplish this trip in under three hours and do the round trip on one tank of gas thats an obvious cost savings too
2883953 we plan to commence a demonstration tour of venezuela when we get the airplane at the end of august
2883954 we will make stops in key cities including valencia barquisimeto maricaibo barcelona margarita and puerto orvaz to announce that mooney has returned to venezuela
2883955 venezuela and brazil are south americas leading markets for general aviation and alberto villasmil is an experienced and extremely respected leader of the ga community we are also pleased to have renewed our relationship with him
2883956 at that point i knew i was going to win the pga championship
2883957 its nice to be able to walk up to a putt and see the line
2883958 for a long time i thought it was sergios day
2883959 i pulled the putt a little on 17 other than that i have no regrets
2883960 its a good situation to get that question its a big step
2883961 the last day has been a rollercoaster and i nearly didnt make it but its great to make a final
2883962 airgyro aviation has been formed to offer customers the variety of aircraft they are looking for in addition to a full menu of services our primary focus at airgyro aviation is to bring the fun and affordability of sport aviation to a generation who may have thought recreational flying was simply out of reach our aircraft are chosen for their ease of flying and their safety features
2883963 airgyro aviation is the exclusive sales outlet for higher class aviations sport hornet and australian light wings sp 2000 outback 2 the sport hornet was certified in 2007 but this is our first outback 2 and we needed to complete the full s lsa certification process
2883964 the registration process was completed two days after the start of this years airventure show we were lucky to have mike huffman available to travel from atlanta to conduct the final inspection s lsa certification is not an easy task and the entire team did a great job
2883965 the airgyro folks have worked hard to meet the astm standards and i am pleased to have been a participant in airgyros efforts to celebrate the certification of the outback 2 at airventure 2008
2883966 we support tactical aircraft at cherry point which is basically any ejection seat equipped aircraft with needs such as search and rescue
2883967 this is a static display and this is a way we can interact with the local community and show them what we do in the marine corps
2883968 we do this a couple of times a month we have a pretty big presence in the local community and we like doing this to show them were out there
2883969 we come out and spend some time answering questions about the helicopter
2883970 were going to leave one of our crewmembers here and were going to take off then were going to come back and get him
2883971 its not everyday that you get hoisted up 75 feet ive never done a hoisting during a static display so it was a little bonus
2883972 our mission is kind of unique in the marine corps
2883973 typically what will happen is that the hospitals will try ambulances first and then other civilian medical transportation aircraft
2883974 if these are unavailable the weather is really bad or if the civilian aircraft cant make it theyll call us
2883975 a lot of the time we take missions civilian units cant
2883976 predominantly because were capable of flying at night and during bad weather
2883977 anything that goes on in the back of the aircraft i take care of that
2883978 once we get into the actual rescue part of it i get these guys in the water or on the ground safely whatever gear our swimmer is calling for i get that ready and send it down to him
2883979 the perk sends a troubling message that even state employees who mess up will be rewarded with a cushy ride home

2883984 its time for a review of vehicle usage when you have that many being taken home
2883985 the overwhelming majority of domicile vehicle privileges are for legitimate public safety and public works purposes however we are reviewing this longstanding policy to ensure that all domicile privileges granted are necessary and cost effective
2883986 unless you are implying that the governor of the commonwealth should not have a state vehicle of any kind i do not see how the stories are related
2883987 youd think hed learn that taxpayers dont take kindly to this kind of abuse
2883988 with barack in town maybe deval can buy him a hotdog and show him his accomplishments since he has been gov it wont take long
2883989 we wanted to let them know what we found and we wanted to tell them some ideas we had on how they could fix that system we felt like the issue was resolved that was verbally affirmed in a monday meeting then friday we find out theres a federal lawsuit against us
2883990 the statute is meant to stop people from committing computer fraud and abuse not to stop people from talking about computers
2883991 these conferences are populated with people from google microsoft sisco wanting to collect information about security vulnerabilities that might exist in their systems if you dont let this information be discussed the attackers are going to research it but no legitimate person is going to talk about it

2884037 now i wont have to listen to your faggot whimpering anymore or your sissy growling
2884038 just because i live in a loft doesnt meant i dont have neighbors and im sure they dont want to listen to the famous pansy nathan knorrs either
2884039 now we all know that youre not gay you fuck more women than anyone i know and for that rrrrr hear him whimper
2884040 if you piss my bed itll be weeks maybe months before you can walk again
2884041 you know mr knorrs for all your pathetic attributes i have to say that i admire your directness and simplicity no ones gotten past this point with a hard on but this just means that we both have a new to reach life is a challenge sometimes you win and sometimes you lose
2884042 maybe if i sit on your face long enough youll choke and die
2884043 get as much air as you can when i come back youre going to need your strength
2884044 you did something nice for me nate and now im going to pay you back
2884045 it might not be as nice as falou but since hes not here to make you feel safe and secure well just pretend
2884046 and it goes like this im going to climb on top of that scrawny little worm you call your penis and then im going to fuck it
2884047 but if you come before i tell you to then you get a bullet in your head

2884053 as the person who knows him best michelle will talk about the barack obama she knows and loves the values that drive him and why she believes hell be an extraordinary president
2884054 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2884055 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2884056 i like the fact no other european has won two majors consecutively
2884057 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2884058 once i got to the weekend and made a few putts it was a question of adrenaline keeping me going
2884059 you just have to give it a go from my experience in majors i know that nobody goes without making mistakes
2884060 i knew i would get my opportunity and it was going to be my day i took that opportunity
2884061 when i started making putts i just stuck in there and it brought my game up the more i got into it the better i played
2884062 i had to convince myself not to get into this sentimental thinking that maybe it is his turn
2884063 i had to convince myself that it is going to be my day i deserve to win three majors you have to be very selfish in this situation when you are on the golf course
2884064 it was evident at carnoustie when i won i was so focused on what i was doing and the high of it and then i turned around i saw sergio and i could see the disappointment and that there was a loser that day
2884065 when i got up to the green i had no idea which was which
2884066 im 10 feet and sergio is four feet i knew i had the opportunity to get the putt in first that was important i knew if i holed this i would probably win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win the pga it was down to that
2884067 i hit a lovely putt read it exactly and it did exactly what i wanted
2884068 i feel like i played well enough to win but it didnt happen thats pretty much all i can ask of myself
2884069 every time you are out there trying to win a major there can only be one winner

2884097 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2884098 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2884099 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2884100 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2884101 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2884102 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2884122 his intensity and effort on the field is one to be admired and one our team can follow
2884123 he goes hard every play and he brings the wood behind everything he throws at the defense his engine is nonstop
2884124 the word about brett when we got here was that he was not physical
2884125 he purposely went out to discredit that rumor i thought he worked hard i thought he could be an asset to us in the passing game but he really competed in the run game i think he made a conscious effort to be physical
2884126 he started off doing well it was not like he was doing bad and then jumped to good he was doing really well and then he built on what he knew and what he was taught and turned into a super good tight end
2884127 it was an honor and a privilege to receive that award especially being voted that award by the new coaching staff
2884128 the thing about coach is that he is very fair he is that loud when you do something bad but at the same time he is that loud when you do something good

2884225 i think people feared brian and thats way down the road for kenny hes still trying to learn the defense and limit the mistakes i know in college he was a very active and physical guy and when we drafted him we anticipated hed be the same
2884226 ill have to call my mom so she can tape it off espn
2884227 its weird because its a penalty lap and you have to do it because you did something bad but people were cheering

2884240 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2884241 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2884242 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2884243 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely

2884258 one of the things that made me proud was a young man who came to me and said after breaking down and crying he didnt feel comfortable going to the church for help
2884259 he heard that here is where he could come and we would talk to him
2884260 we were breaking the limits of our existing manufacturing facility
2884261 we can lock that down and not always be changing it

2884263 what was probably as significant as anything was getting out of the way of calamity

2884265 from a point of view of a company such as cascade its very important to stop this immediately
2884266 through the lawsuit we hope to find out whether its an isolated problem
2884267 last year we made a lot of leaps forward to improve offerings and our reputation in the community

2884272 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2884273 i think the more minutes we get together in the olympics the better it is
2884274 we have 180 minutes now and get 90 more against new zealand so we will improve our game from one game to another
2884275 i think the more minutes we get and the more we play together the more we can get done

2884284 i wanted to go 1 45 and if it werent for that messed up finish i would have done it
2884285 i just wanted to save as much energy as possible for the relay
2884286 they are the olympic champions so even when we had match point we couldnt take anything for granted
2884287 it was the first major setback of the tournament for the host nation which is looking to dominate on home soil after winning three of five gold medals in athens after they won both maeda and suetsuna bowed deeply in the center of the court as though they were praying

2884289 i was nervous at first but got more confidence as the game went on
2884290 there is a lot of pressure on me here to get a medal
2884291 lee comes into the tournament as one of the favorites to win gold
2884292 a lot of people try to get over on them
2884293 so many people apparently i said if i dont get a sixth year no one should get a sixth year
2884294 im very happy with the ncaa because they are taking their time and they are weighing the decision
2884295 he went home for all the right reasons and im very confident that everything will be worked out
2884296 he couldnt come to any of my games cause he couldnt fly
2884297 i had my four west virginia years at the time i didnt think i was going to come back
2884298 if the owners always there everybody works hard once the owner leaves everybody slacks off thats the way it always is
2884299 he came back in july and he was pumping 30 reps at 225 pounds
2884300 this is a critical time with a lot of camps starting
2884301 i tell them you wouldnt think of playing football without your helmet or pads well youre an athlete and food and fluids are part of your equipment
2884302 when i came here in january 2007 we were a fat football team
2884303 you cant flex fat fat cannot produce force fat will slow you down a high percent of body fat will exhaust you faster youre supposed to be an athlete
2884304 you play the game with your body take care of your body
2884305 nutrition is not that hard apple twinkie its not that difficult
2884306 so many young players think they can get in shape at the last minute which most of them do
2884307 the problem with that is that all of a sudden theyre trying to get in shape at the same time theyre learning their drills and most dont juggle all those things well
2884308 you cant wait until camp and say ok im going to change my body it doesnt work for high school it doesnt work for college and it doesnt work for pros
2884309 because youve got 75 80 percent of your kids going both ways playing offense and defense youve got to be in tip top shape to do that especially when youre playing in august and early september in western pennsylvania when it can get into the 90s during games
2884310 we try to tell our kids to eat the right foods take your protein shakes and your protein bars just so they can replenish any fuel that leaves their body during a workout we change their eating habits a little bit and they buy into it and so do the parents so that helps
2884311 the name of the game now when a college recruiter comes in they want to see how the kid moves
2884312 a kid who weighs 320 pounds and cant move it hurts him
2884313 i put on five 10 pounds because my mom is like a food nazi
2884314 maybe a little more because i couldnt run coach saw me and said get moving
2884315 but weight is not really a concern for me i can lose 10 pounds in a week i just do some running and eat healthy for a week and it comes right off
2884316 occasionally ill go up against a real big kid like a freak
2884317 but the bigger guy doesnt always win id rather face a big fat sloppy kid than a small quick kid you can use positioning and get in a fat players way theyre not real coordinated and just trip over themselves
2884318 we have kids who get weighed every day trying to get bigger
2884319 the key is you have to be able to run id rather have a kid that is undersized and can move than a kid who is huge because you cant even get some of those big kids to move some of these guys are just so big and it takes away from their performance
2884320 weve had big kids last year our two tackles were 6 6 295 and 275 but they were lean kids i would say we very rarely have heavy kids on our team kids who are big and heavy are going to wear down they cant perform in the fourth quarter and theres the risk of injury
2884321 were not trying to build big kids were trying to build football players
2884322 the right way to do something you should never do

2884366 the flare up of major hostilities between russia and georgia has been dubbed by some
2884367 the fighting backfired and the russian counteroffensive now seems aimed at capturing the 40 of south ossetia which was under georgian control until last week
2884368 they the russians control pretty much all of south ossetia now
2884369 if russia is serious about its peacekeeping role in the region it will do no more than push georgian forces out of south ossetia and attempt to return to the status quo before fighting broke out last week
2884370 the conflict could widen already georgias other separatist region the black sea enclave of abkhazia is mobilising and soon tbilisi could find itself fighting on two fronts other small nations could become involved in a broader caucasian war
2884371 the conflict spreads further still bringing in former soviet republics such as ukraine which like georgia aspires to nato membership and kazakhstan which is loyal to moscow the war in yugoslavia would seem like small fry compared with any war among former soviet republics

2884379 i think of those little kids over there just laying in their beds listening to the planes i dont hate people who are for the war it seems unfathomable that someone would not want to drive us because of our political views but were learning more and more that its not that unfathomable to a large percentage of the population
2884380 everybody talks about how this war was over quickly and not that many people died tell that to the parents of people coming home in body bags
2884381 natalies comment came from frustration that we all shared we were apparently days away from war and still left with a lot of questions

2884432 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2884433 its more of a team unity thing unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2884434 not great not fantastic but overall i played well i played the big points pretty well i think it was just a matter of a couple of points here and there that turned the match around
2884435 he likes taking the ball early and he likes dictating play
2884436 the deeper i hit the ball the less opportunity he had to dictate play which i think frustrated him at times i dont think he played the greatest match for him im sure hes disappointed as well i think a lot of that had to do with me making a few adjustments
2884437 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2884438 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2884439 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2884440 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2884441 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2884442 it lets us be relaxed and not press as much
2884443 its just one of those things where we go out there and have fun
2884444 it felt good to go out there and throw strikes
2884445 i think what hurt me last year was that i walked too many guys i really wanted to go out there and throw strikes and i accomplished that so im happy
2884446 he had a better breaking ball better command than what i saw in spring practice

2884474 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience to bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
2884475 i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2884476 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement

2884489 signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews
2884490 for our bloggers especially this may require a bit of an adjustment
2884491 some of you like to try out ideas that end up as subjects of stories or columns in print first if in doubt consult your editor
2884492 if the carriers offered marketers a different type of pricing where the marketer paid the cost rather than the consumer youd see a different type of response
2884493 a show could go from london to new york to australia to berlin to toronto
2884494 they need to be thought about in terms of how they can work in each individual market
2884495 when a show comes across we sometimes tweak the american logo here and in new york they sometimes tweak one of ours
2884496 we go around the world with them which has been fantastic
2884497 for a show like mamma mia we have a person here who concentrates on international productions
2884498 well run our companies in the same way we always have
2884499 but we will have the strength of knowing what theyre doing before we would have heard about it and vice versa
2884500 when it came over here the producer said id like to use the same design as in new york

2884502 when youre trying to get people to buy a ticket for a show that hasnt opened what we and dewynters create is an idea that is visceral something people can feel

2884513 about what the company intends to do with your data and your information
2884514 like all privacy matters its something that people need to be informed on
2884515 that is why congress at this point is wanting to gather a lot more information because no one knows
2884516 that information is incredibly valuable its the new frontier of advertising
2884517 we can understand exactly what each sector of the communications industry is technically capable of doing and how they use the information once they do get access to it
2884518 we dont have any raw data on the identifiable individual
2884519 fuel costs are a major issue but so is the cost of everything else partly due to increased shipping expenses ammunition has risen steeply since last hunting season even the cost of shelled corn has skyrocketed as hunters compete with ethanol production ive heard corn prices as high as 10 for a 50 pound bag thats double last years cost
2884520 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2884521 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2884522 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
2884523 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2884524 we found one variant to be associated with weight and lean mass in both ethnic groups this variant was also associated with height total fat mass and hdl cholesterol but only in european american women a different variant was associated with triglyceride levels and hdl cholesterol in african american women
2884525 insects store fat like mammals do as lipid droplets accumulated in the fat body the functional equivalent of both mammalian liver and white adipose tissue
2884526 drosophila share many components of fat biosynthesis degradation and regulation with humans including many of those implicated in diabetes and obesity
2884527 et donc une petite fille de huit ans peut elle tre amoureuse cest une vraie question qui peut le dire cet ge l lamour est un petit mot si simple on la sur le bout de la langue on na aucune id e de son pouvoir de ses asp rit s ou du prix payer il est facile de se moquer dune petite fille qui d clare tre amoureuse et pourtant je le d clarais
2884528 we are concerned where borrowings feature non commercial interest rates or where there is capitalisation of interest or where members provide personal guarantees secured beyond charges over the asset purchased
2884529 this showed once again that the housing market is performing in line with the wider economy
2884530 the great thing about digital business is that the cost barriers are coming down every day and youd be surprised how many websites you visit are being run from peoples spare rooms
2884531 i know people who have insisted they need webex and a pabx and other expensive technology we are more about freeconference com skype and really anything thats free
2884532 we have been able to license our technology to larger software companies which has helped fund our growth and enabled us to reach users we wouldnt have otherwise been able to reach
2884533 they were building the wrong product for the market the customer was dissatisfied and talking to competitors and they didnt know
2884534 the customer was actually willing to pay a lot more for the product they just didnt ask
2884535 r amp d is a never ending process and you cant wait till the product is perfect because by that time the customers needs are different the market has moved on or you might have invested in functions and features that are no longer relevant
2884536 we wasted a lot of business development and marketing activities on opportunities that were difficult or impossible to translate into sales
2884537 it is critical for a start up to have a professional discipline around the sales process and the day to day execution of sales
2884538 this way you get a beta version of the product in the market and get immediate client feedback you get to create great client relationships by having a marquee client who drives the r amp d direction of the product and you deliver early revenues
2884539 well use our network of contacts other ceos of it companies to see what they use
2884540 properties on the road have some of the best harbour views of any city in the world with stunning scenery across to the famous sydney harbour bridge and the opera house
2884541 if we find for a particular query that result no 4 should be result no 1 we do not have the capability to manually change it we have to find what weakness in the algorithm caused that result and find a general solution to that evaluate whether a general solution really works and if its better and then launch a general solution
2884542 there is a drop in retail spending and consumer confidence with retail being down the first thing they are going to do is cut back on payments to suppliers its a long time for these businesses to wait
2884543 people have seen that as a great way to fund their cashflow without disruption to their business
2884544 its been growing consistently for the last 10 years at about 20 a year
2884545 businesses are seeing debtor finance as a real tool to fund their cashflow and the banks have put much more emphasis on these products we are really just catching up with the us and europe where debtor finance is a mainstream product
2884546 with the economic conditions in australia we see people hurting
2884547 it is affecting a different type of person store managers are reporting that a lot of the customers theyre seeing are new they have turned to places like the salvos out of economic necessity
2884548 there are some funky things that you can get at vinnies that you cant get elsewhere
2884549 we often get very high quality goods donated to our stores people often come across designer label items if they dig deep enough on the rack
2884550 if you buy something from the salvos you know youre reducing landfill
2884551 staff work very hard and often work quite long hours
2884552 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2884553 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year
2884554 i dont think these incidents will have any impact on the beijing olympics but of course we will further tighten security in the region
2884555 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2884556 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2884557 this is your fourth visit it makes you the us president who has visited china the most and demonstrates the great importance you have attached to the development of sino us ties
2884558 i express my heartfelt sympathy to you and the family of the victims over this unfortunate incident
2884559 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2884560 a senseless act of violence this appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics
2884561 for 17 years i have had a very hands on role i spent time with the salesforce management team and employees 100 of the time
2884562 but i believe if we are to take advantage of this marketplace i need to utilise my skills where i can get the most bang for buck we have a professional ceo to take the burden on the operational side and i can work with the management team to work out how to work out the best way to take advantage of the opportunities out there
2884563 about six years ago i became concerned about the credit market and changed strategy to that of a large mortgage broker with a diversified strategy of rolling out different products such as credit cards and that was a very good call but now brokers are disappearing this gives us an opportunity to leverage our strong foundations and brand technology and infrastructure to grow more rapidly
2884564 we want to double treble in size we have 600 mortgage writers and many dont have the financial clout and brand or know how but if they link with us their opportunities will be greater
2884565 we have cumbersome infrastructure if we can build scale it will help us become bigger so we can keep providing consumers with more choice
2884566 we dont have the balance sheet of the big players but we have a good name a good reputation
2884567 tens of millions or 100 million it depends on the acquisitions
2884568 we want to go into regional australia and open up more franchise shops to roll out more personal loans credit cards insurance
2884569 we are not into small business loans but that is something we want to look at
2884570 this is it as an entrepreneur i have no other business interests i am not a director of any other companies except a few charities
2884571 i am still going around flying the flag opening doors and speaking to the media i will just not be locked in my office or at as many meetings but i will ease my way out and see how everyone performs and the company operates
2884572 if you are in the shipping business its helpful to have all of your potential competitors be taught that the earth is flat
2884573 to suppose that safety first consists in having a small gamble in a large number of different companies where i have no information to reach a good judgment as compared with a substantial stake in a company where ones information is adequate strikes me as a travesty of investment policy
2884574 a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the wright brothers indeed if a farsighted capitalist had been present at kitty hawk he would have done his successors a huge favour by shooting orville down
2884575 it really is a case of the squeaky wheel getting the oil
2884576 your clients need to know that you are following them and that you wont go away until you are paid and dont bother sending polite little notes with crocodile stamps personal phone calls always work better
2884577 anything to personalise your approach and help your business stand out from the others clamouring for payment helps
2884578 references can be helpful just to determine whether a client is a tyre kicker and will often tell you a bit about the credibility of the individual as long as you actually check them
2884579 clients should be told about discounts upfront people often dont take up discounts even when they know about them so if you are having trouble it is worth going back and explaining to them what they could be saving if they pay on time that will often get their attention
2884580 small businesses often allow themselves to be at the end of the food chain because they afraid of losing a client but in the end your business is put at risk anyway
2884581 you have to have conviction that your product is the best your client wants to do business with you and they will meet your payment terms to get it
2884582 look at your book and think about how important your bigger debtors are to your business if there is one or two that would knock your business over if they didnt pay it may be worth controlling that by insuring their payment
2884583 small businesses with sales reps often pay commission on the amount of sales so by swinging it around and paying a commission on sales banked you may find that all of a sudden your sales team is in there helping you collect that money
2884584 small business owners often find it difficult to go from marketing to customers to being the bad guy chasing payment
2884585 swapping with another business owner can make it easier and the client doesnt need to know
2884586 debtor finance is a legitimate option and getting more common
2884587 i will generally advice clients to use an overdraft first but for those with a decent book and a cash shortage it can work
2884588 we take the view that todays debtor is tomorrows customer it really just comes down to maintaining a professional relationship being clear about what your standards are and the consequences for breaching them and following through with that
2884589 the people you outsource to dont know your business as well as your staff do if a client has a problem with an invoice or says they didnt receive a notice then they will have to come back to you and check then go back to the client and that can be cumbersome
2884590 for that reason i generally think outsourcing is most useful at the sharper end of things
2884591 we see as many businesses go broke through expanding as contracting because they dont understand how to balance growth with things like capital investment as their company grows
2884592 i felt like i should treasure everything that i have because you never know
2884593 i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
2884594 in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
2884595 we will be checking to see if this driver was working part time for someone else
2884596 as you know one of his speeding tickets was for when he was working for another company
2884597 so much for the retirement plans that we had made
2884598 i have talked with thaksins private secretary who confirmed thaksin will not return to thailand
2884599 i asked her as details on the verification have yet to be decided can i take it that the delisting wont happen today
2884600 if youre in this role as an elected official and you want to serve again you look for opportunities
2884601 if i waited until i term limited off the council i wouldnt have anything to run for
2884602 ive been asked by a lot of people to do that
2884603 its a regional type position where im gone all the time im getting to be at an age where having a private life is important to me as well
2884604 i think theres a little bit of voodoo magic in property tax evaluation and assessment
2884605 i think theres a good opportunity to educate people about those things and id like to do that
2884606 when i was first elected to the council i thought if i could get a second term that would be enough but now im not ready to retire
2884607 de forma contundente el bombardeo fuera de osetia del sur
2884608 la agresi n rusa no debe quedar sin respuesta y su continuaci n tendr graves consecuencias para sus relaciones con eeuu
2884609 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2884610 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2884611 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2884612 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2884613 i love the idea of the back nine on sunday at a major
2884614 i love it so much that im kinda disappointed theres eight months until the next one i need the adrenaline
2884615 i feel like ive played well enough to win more than two majors throughout my career to this point
2884616 unfortunately it hasnt happened that doesnt mean im not on the right track its just a matter of time
2884617 paddy is just so mentally tough and hes a great putter
2884618 when he gets an opportunity he always takes advantage of it
2884619 hes won three of the last six majors thats tiger like right there he knows how to win and hes not afraid to win and thats what it takes
2884620 everyone wants a quick fix so they want me to give them a pill to solve the problem
2884621 we ended up giving our granddaughter another dog so that her dog had another mate
2884622 then it completely solved the problem no behavior issues whatsoever
2884623 ultimately it is the interaction and the behavior modification that is going to make the difference
2884624 people forget that they buy a yorkie like sky and they think oh this is wonderful they dont think about the quality of life on dogs its just as important as your quality of life
2884625 the event is highlighted by a punk rock bbq held at hadads lake where members of the punk community from all over the country come to ride track bikes and discuss belt buckles
2884626 we may not hes got priorities and needs to take care of those things
2884627 our knee jerk reaction was we were angry we were upset and we wanted to talk to our friends and family
2884628 its always disappointing to concede a goal in the dying minutes
2884629 the best example of 19th century cityscape still standing in the u s
2884630 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2884631 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that its a very unfortunate set of circumstances
2884632 i must confess i was born at a very early age
2884633 i must confess i was born at a very ea
2884634 one of the great fallacies of american thinking is that human worth is constituted by a particular set of aptitudes which lead to economic advancement
2884635 in requirements meetings it gets people to crystallize what they want and keeps me focused on whats important
2884636 what is the minimum result that will satisfy your needs
2884637 without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime which was certainly committed partly for financial gain and with no regard to the sanctity of human life i believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate
2884638 my client states his instructions are that ben clark acted alone and that is what we maintained throughout the trial and unfortunately the jury did not accept that
2884639 do not ask what your country can do for you
2884640 we the people in order to form a more perfect union
2884641 the time is fulfilled the kingdom of god is near
2884642 religion that is pure and undefiled before god the abba is this to care for orphans and widows in their distress
2884643 the time is now the kingdom of god is here repent or change if you translate it literally and believe in the good news
2884644 they want to make regime change and they want to get rid of any democratic movement in this part of their neighborhood thats it period
2884645 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2884646 russia is at the moment a party in this conflict
2884647 on a scale of 1 to 10 we are at about 2
2884648 underlines that the pursuit of military action would affect its relationship with russia
2884649 the first thing that has to happen is that the violence has to stop and russian forces have to be withdrawn
2884650 why thats a legitimate use of military assets is beyond me
2884651 not since the destruction of the soviet union have they done things like that
2884652 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2884653 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2884654 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd
2884655 but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
2884656 told us that they had no active weapons of mass destruction program
2884657 the going in assumption was that we were going to war so this nie was to be written with that in mind
2884658 reported that production of chemical and biological weapons was taking place
2884659 gave those of us at the most senior level further confidence that our information about saddams wmd programs was correct
2884660 this is the worst cover up in the history of the military
2884661 when the issue i believe of the use of the vaccine comes out i believe it will make the walter reed scandal pale in comparison
2884662 i cant look at my old pictures i really cant
2884663 i start looking at my old pictures and i start crying
2884664 i looked at every branch but i wanted the marine corps because the marine corps was the few and the proud
2884665 they asked us our name we stood on these yellow footprints and they gave us this shot and we got the rest of the day off
2884666 after that shot i started swelling up i gained 30 pounds of water my eyes swelled up where i couldnt see i started snoring i developed a rash on my hand
2884667 all service members vaccinations are documented in the individuals permanent medical record
2884668 we call it c y a thats unfortunately an s o p in the military
2884669 healthcare workers and vaccine recipients to report adverse reactions events
2884670 i see the way the propaganda and information war is waged against americas sons and daughters and how patients are treated who claim to be injured from a vaccine
2884671 i would hope to god not but from what ive seen i would have to say yes
2884672 my biggest wish just to get up and be without pain
2884673 my office is in frequent communication with the marine corps and the family and weve requested answers to the familys specific questions i have also assisted mr fey in receiving his va benefits for health care service connected disability and education assistance his mother has been a strong advocate on his behalf and i look forward to continuing working with her to resolve outstanding issues it is imperative that everything possible is done to keep the brave men and women serving in our military safe

2884677 we have sufficient forces to contain the violence in north cotabato
2884678 we really wanted the elections postponed because it could delay the implementation of any agreement that would be reached if the two sides conclude a deal by november 2009
2884679 unless we get a full blown war over there then thats the only time it might significantly affect
2884680 it seems that we are having a good election and the people our brothers and sisters in the south are showing us the way

2884685 a simple structural split of telecoms retail business newco from the remaining wholesale and network business of telecom netco but has now stepped up its campaign with a move to have new independent directors of its own choosing elected to the board
2884686 outlines the significant benefits the proposal could bring for telecom its shareholders and customers
2884687 for almost a year we have been trying to talk to telecom about some of our ideas and concerns regarding the affairs of the company

2884696 we rely on them to give us access to opportunities and worlds to which we dont belong
2884697 community and alliances will rule in the twenty first century success is dependent on whom you know and how you work with them 291
2884698 they are both going to play a lot and they are both going to play together at times because when we put them out there together it opens up a whole new challenge for defenses trying to stop us
2884699 with both of us out there you have no idea who is getting the ball and that makes us both more dangerous that is what made west virginia so good they had pat white steve slaton and noel devine back there thats a lot to deal with hopefully people will say the same thing about us
2884700 i owe larod a thanks for everything because last year i didnt know anything and he helped me out led the way for me
2884701 he really took me in and put me under his wing like i was a little brother i tell him all the time hes the big dog im the pup it doesnt matter to me if he carries the ball or i carry the ball because if he succeeds and our team succeeds then i am succeeding as well
2884702 the key is we both want to see the other guy succeed it doesnt matter who is getting the glory who is running the ball people from the outside ask me all the time if i have a problem with shady mccoy and i just laugh because i have no problem with him i love to be around him
2884703 a lot of time we look to larod to give us a spark
2884704 like last year against cincinnati stephens howling had 100 yards and scored the winning touchdown against the bearcats i was struggling to get yards and when he went in i told him lets get it started and he did and that motivated me to do better
2884705 i love to watch the flames dance they are beautiful
2884706 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2884707 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2884708 home to over three million fossils from the last ice age
2884709 i will not join in this party of destruction you total goat fucks
2884710 i tend to thrive in a solo situation or i separate myself in group situations by hogging attention i dont know how to play the middle ground and this piece is a comment on that
2884711 this mirrors the wider asia pacific trend where issuance decreased 47 percent to us 28 2 billion by way of 330 deals
2884712 the decline in ipo activity is largely because of the current bearish trend in market condition equity markets have tanked so much that companies do not get good valuations
2884713 women on web kept in contact with me via e mail the medication arrived through customs properly blister packed with complete paperwork and a doctors signature
2884714 medication from other websites came in unmarked bottles with no instructions or paperwork it was quite frightening i was not very far along only three or four weeks it went smoothly for me i think its very important women have this resource to turn to in that situation and they can need it for a number of reasons
2884715 the women on web site is very helpful and reputable
2884716 but for northern ireland women it is encouraging them to break the law and as an organisation we have to work within the law were really concerned about women accessing the rogue sites were hearing about it and we know its happening there are potentially serious medical complications for women from sites which arent well managed and this could be the new era of backstreet abortions
2884717 this is very worrying indeed it represents further trivialisation of the value of the unborn child
2884718 its like taking abortion into the shadows these drugs have side effects and tragedies will increase
2884719 overthrow the pro western pro democracy georgian president mikheil saakashvili
2884720 gain control of south ossetia and abkhazia an important enclave near the black sea coast
2884721 a systems capacity to produce unancitipated change through unfiltered contributions from broad and varied audiences
2884722 most problems confronting a network can be solved later by others dont do anything that can be done later by users
2884723 if security considerations had not been so widely ignored in the internet this memo would not have been possible
2884724 the drawback of arguing generally against perfect enforcement because one objects to the laws likely to be enforced is that it preaches to the choir
2884725 select from products where product no between 133 and 171 order by product no
2884726 i am very concerned about the expansion of hostilities well beyond the region of south ossetia rather than acting as a neutral peacekeeper russia has escalated the hostilities through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside the conflict zone canada calls on russia to respect georgias borders and to desist from any further encroachment on georgias territorial integrity
2884727 canada is gravely concerned about the recent violence in south ossetia and we deplore the casualties that have resulted we call for an immediate halt to the hostilities and strongly urge all parties involved to display restraint in words and deeds and to respect national boundaries
2884728 no people and no part of a people shall be held against its will in a political association that it does not want
2884729 it makes me wonder has someone in the chinese government read notes from the libertarians who formed the first government in the us
2884730 we had expected this to happen ive already said this before dont make it an open forum do it behind closed doors there will surely be some form of extreme reaction that will occur if it was held openly
2884731 weve expected the incident to happen because the issue that was to be discussed is sensitive
2884732 as a society comprising different races malaysians have displayed the spirit of tolerance and respect to the other races
2884733 if we try to dissect or argue against the basic terms that was agreed upon in the constitution then it will surely cause endless arguments which can affect our countrys peace and stability
2884734 text and email each other almost every day and speak on the phone at least a couple of times a week often more
2884735 people are tired of realtors who are constantly talking about themselves
2884736 theyre tired of the stagnant web sites where theyre getting old information all the time and theyre also tired of realtors who are constantly talking about themselves
2884737 we should all be a lot more crazy god never intended christians to be a bunch of boring careful people shackled to plans
2884738 you should let go of the strings and let your life be more radical

2884743 were finding clear evidence that working on country has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2884744 the health benefits in terms of reducing levels of high blood pressure diabetes and kidney disease are quite striking when people are actively engaged in looking after their country
2884745 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2884746 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2884747 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country
2884748 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity

2884750 the demand for prior withdrawal of the invaders is just and our government supports it cuban president raul castro said in a written statement

2884754 the resources sector is dragging the market down but thats to be expected as metal prices were softer overnight
2884755 the banks are all higher but the market is still sceptical about the rally

2884764 instead we will be going one better and will focus on long term unemployed by requiring them to get paid work and get off the benefit
2884765 within 12 months of taking office national will require everyone who has been on the dole for more than a year to re apply for their benefit and undergo a comprehensive work assessment
2884766 the 1990s is back and today the national party showed how bereft they really are of new ideas
2884767 long term welfare dependency locks people into a life of limited income and limited choices
2884768 sebagai pembikin filem saya dapat mengagak filem ini mampu meraih kemenangan jika dirujuk pada kepayahan dalam menyiapkan filem ini malah kemenangan ini me nandakan juri faham dengan kerja dan pengorbanan kami selama ini
2884769 sebenarnya penggambaran filem ini suatu yang sukar memandangkan setiap adegan perlu dirakam menggunakan tiga medium berbeza iaitu polaroid digital dan filem tu juannya untuk mendapatkan warna yang kontra dan sesuai dengan konsep hitam putih filem ini
2884770 bagaimanapun saya merasakan kemenangan ini berbaloi dan cabaran filem ini disambung menerusi estet yang membabitkan 700 pelakon untuk pelbagai adegan termasuk menari dan berlakon
2884771 ada filem yang ditonton hingga tiga kali supaya juri berpuas hati dengan keputusan memilih pemenang se jujurnya memang sukar untuk juri memilih pemenang malah persaingan antara filem yang bertanding dalam top 5 ini begitu sengit
2884772 bagi juri setiap filem yang bertanding mempunyai ke kuatan dan kelemahan seperti kmbm filem ini mempunyai kelebihan kerana menampilkan konsep hitam putih pada masa kini semua orang mampu membuat filem warna tetapi berbeza dengan hitam putih
2884773 setiap juri mempunyai kepakaran berbeza dalam membuat penilaian termasuk kassim masdor yang dijemput untuk mengadili kategori lagu tema terbaik bagaimanapun saya tidak bersetuju dengan kenyataan daripada erma fatima yang menyatakan anugerah khas juri adalah anugerah kasihan atau sedekah
2884774 sebenarnya penganjur menyediakan lima kuota untuk anugerah berkenaan tetapi hanya empat diberikan pada malam ini pemberian anugerah ini pula berdasarkan kriteria sesebuah filem dan juri tidak bersikap mahu menjaga hati dalam memilih pemenang
2884775 dalam hati saya hanya orang kecil yang selama ini mungkin ada yang tidak pernah percaya dengan lakonan saya sungguhpun begitu saya terus berlakon dan akhirnya berbaloi selepas menanti lebih 40 tahun saya berasa sangat gembira seperti di usia muda dan menjerit apabila diumumkan sebagai pemenang
2884776 sememangnya saya terkejut dengan kemenangan ini dan menganggap usaha saya dalam filem ini berbaloi filem lain memberikan saingan yang kuat di sebalik filem komersial saya namun saya mahu berkongsi wang kemenangan ini bersama tujuh kakitangan saya pergi bercuti selepas ini
2884777 saya tidak menjangkakan kemenangan ini kerana saya masih baru berbanding pelakon lain yang mempunyai banyak pengalaman lakon bagi saya semua pelakon dalam kategori ini berbakat dan saya mahu belajar ilmu lakon daripada mereka
2884778 would you think i was crazy if i said i think i might have a blood clot in my leg

2884783 the event is highlighted by a punk rock bbq held at hadads lake where members of the punk community from all over the country come to ride track bikes and discuss belt buckles
2884784 its disturbing that restrictions are imposed on mere assumptions and not incidents
2884785 bangalore is perhaps the only city in india with narrow minded restrictions
2884786 such simple joys of life cannot be called illegal and it is time we stand for what we love and live before it is too late

2884814 newspapers as you know have declined thats all there is to it they have fewer eyeballs as a marketer you have to go where the eyeballs are having said that we believe strongly in newspapers always have and in the foreseeable future always will
2884815 i wanted her not to tell the public what had happened
2884816 im saying you asked me about that photograph i dont know anything about that photograph i dont know who that baby is i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2884817 its not a bad thing to do but its a sign of weakness
2884818 youve got the most highly educated technogically advantaged people there theyre all drinking coffee and reading the newspaper
2884819 i know the peoples pulse they are waiting for me to announce the launch of my party chiranjeevi told reporters
2884820 i wanted to go 1 45 and if it werent for that messed up finish i would have done it
2884821 i just wanted to save as much energy as possible for the relay
2884822 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2884823 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2884824 youve got to tip your hat to somebody that does something like that in a pressure packed race like that thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2884825 i just got to go home and take care of myself its going to be a tight final natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2884826 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final

2884829 normally at lunch id go home but of course i cant go home usually id not take as many snaps id go hit golf balls whatever now obviously i cant do that
2884830 youve still got to have some down time in camp but every time i have 15 minutes if im not studying i feel like im cheating myself
2884831 at some point like i did last night im looking at the playbook and im just staring at it i got to put it up
2884832 ive always felt like in any offense or defense throughout the nfl theres too much volume
2884833 the coaches have way too much free time you dont have to have 1 000 plays to be successful you have to run five or 10 of them very well bottom line is you run 70 plays in a game you repeat half of those well condense it down theyre throwing everything at me right now
2884834 like in a game he pumped and laid it in there before the safety got over there
2884835 its going to be one of the strongest linebacking corps in the middle with him and patrick
2884836 great guy as far as football goes hes just a leader hes got that quality about him he knows his stuff he pays attention to his film study hes prepared hes the type of guy you need on a defense thats a plus
2884837 i think the biggest thing is weve gotten better since then from a personnel standpoint
2884838 obviously with patrick willis inside that exposes the guys next to him a lot
2884839 i think it showed some glimpses of what i can do
2884840 im still learning the defense it was a solid game
2884841 pretending she is on an intimate footing with those she slanders
2884842 you cant play table tennis in there without a 20 bet being put down so worrying about where we are going to finish and how many games we finish doesnt even come into the thought process
2884843 the enjoyment you see on the boys faces there this morning after winning the game how can you tell them to lose its a ridiculous thought
2884844 ive played good footy at centre half back for this club ive played good footy at centre half forward full forward and in the middle

2884848 are not there yet but it looks like they are getting ready for it
2884849 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2884850 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
2884851 we must find the means for an immediate ceasefire accepted by both sides we must talk about negotiations and a political solution there is no military solution
2884852 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2884853 there were signs of violence both suffered severe head injuries whoever did this continued to hit them while they were on the floor
2884854 it really was a shock to know they both died
2884855 ken was a kind caring man who would always pick things up and put your dustbin tucked neatly out of the way just a very nice caring man

2884859 let me tell you about a story i didnt want to write about back in december
2884860 sam stein and the enquirer are nothing but lazy no good trashy gossips
2884861 not the stuff the american public wants to hear about in this election cycle
2884862 we havent modelled that but we would not expect it to have any impact
2884863 senator what i am saying is that the prices you are talking about are generally set in international markets and this would not have any impact on those prices
2884864 as far as we are aware no approaches have been made to treasury for a meeting from the north west shelf
2884865 just because you want to achieve a particularly result to use one policy tool such as the carbon production reduction scheme or whatever its called that doesnt mean you need to have an uneven situation for another policy tool
2884866 we would not expect this to have any impact on exploration in other areas but we have not necessarily modelled that in particular either
2884867 if i pay my kids to do their homework i am saying you will get this if you do your homework but i am also saying homework is not likely to have intrinsic rewards
2884868 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2884869 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short

2884877 es un tema que ya nos tiene cansados porque desde hace d as se est hablando de cifras de que hay un arreglo y todo eso es falso doy mi palabra de honor que no existe nada
2884878 lo nico que se est logrando con todo esto es tener inquieto al jugador y tambi n a la gente que luego piensa que somos nosotros y no es el caso

2884880 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
2884881 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2884882 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2884883 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2884884 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2884885 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2884886 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2884887 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2884888 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2884889 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2884890 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2884891 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2884892 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city

2884898 in nazareth he really found his style of guitar making and the guitars that c f martin senior built really came to define the instrument

2884900 what they are doing is checking every note they have to be able to do that quickly and they have to be able to identify if a note is being played correctly it has to be perfect when it goes out
2884901 if i use up all the good wood im out of business
2884902 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2884903 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2884904 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2884905 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2884906 you told me more about the process than i know
2884907 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2884908 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2884909 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2884910 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2884911 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2884912 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2884913 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2884914 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2884915 we must refuse to accept that low socioeconomic status makes it ok for poorer children to fail school
2884916 while higher levels of investment in struggling schools and low socioeconomic communities will help thats not the whole answer
2884917 as a nation we should then be tracking attainment knowing that we are in the powerful position of comparing like schools with like schools
2884918 if two schools have comparable school populations but widely varying results we would be able to ask the question why and ascertain the answer
2884919 we should be able to identify best practice and innovation and work systematically to ensure that they are spread more widely
2884920 we should be able to especially assist those schools that need it
2884921 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2884922 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2884923 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2884924 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2884925 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2884926 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2884927 i love doing what im doing its an amazing experience and ive got absolutely no intention of giving it away
2884928 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements

2884939 whispered in musharrafs ear that it is time to leave
2884940 over the next few days they will make it clear to him musharraf that a protracted battle against impeachment is not in pakistans interests
2884941 we are calling for the case to be handed over to the cbi central bureau of investigation four deaths have taken place in a short span
2884942 without formulating the domicile policy the government is conducting the teachers examination this way the local people will suffer and outsiders will get jobs in the state
2884943 they dont care if they dont have enough money as long theyre happy
2884944 for nearly forty years now diet pills have been making their march across the world as a successful means for aiding weight loss but when does a diet pill become too strong
2884945 if i can become the chief minister of indias most populous state four times and this time entirely on my own without anyone elses support then why cant i become the countrys prime minister
2884946 if you pose this question to my casteist political adversaries they will have no answer to this because they cannot see a dalits daughter rising to such heights
2884947 these parties felt most threatened when my name was proposed for prime ministership during the course of the upa governments trust vote in parliament so both the nda and upa decided to gang up and save the central government
2884948 well i should express my gratitude to these very parties as the profile enhancement that the bsp witnessed over a span of just six or seven days was something we would have otherwise taken six or seven years to achieve
2884949 realising that the rise of the bsp was a direct threat to them the congress led upa was looking for new ways and means to run me down and the latest in the series was implicating me in the disproportionate assets case that has been speeded up particularly after i refused to support them during the trust vote
2884950 my supporters are aware that all the wealth and property i have acquired actually consists of the gifts i have received on my birthdays and nearly rs 30 crores rs 300 million out of that has been given away as income tax yet the government is trying to harass me by cooking up false cases
2884951 i am sure my supporters are not going to get affected by such falsehood and campaigns launched by my adversaries
2884952 while the bjp began to hound me by fabricating cases in the name of the taj corridor the congress left no stone unturned in attempting to tarnish my image by letting loose the cbi to concoct cases against me
2884953 the congress leadership wanted to send me to jail so as soon as i learnt about their conspiracy i moved the supreme court and i am confident of getting justice from there
2884954 what finally led me to withdraw support to the upa government was their utter neglect of uttar pradesh for which they were not willing to pay any heed to our repeated demand for a special package of rs 80 000 crores rs 800 billion
2884955 on the contrary we extended full support to them to elect their own president
2884956 dont get disheartened even if i lose the case in the apex court and the congress succeeds in its design to send me to jail on trumped up corruption charges
2884957 the successor i have chosen for myself is someone 18 to 20 years younger to me and hails from my own chamar community
2884958 but let me make it absolutely clear that he is not anyone belonging to my family
2884959 i have penned down his name in a sealed packet left in the safe custody of two of my close confidantes
2884960 these two people have been told to open the packet and disclose the name of this successor either in the event of my sudden death or if my political adversaries succeed in their vicious gameplan of sending me to jail on trumped up charges
2884961 there will be no alliances with any party that has an alliance with the congress from now on
2884962 the left will have no alliance with those parties that are directly or indirectly linked to any party or parties on the basis of any understanding with the upa or nda in future
2884963 now karunanidhi will make it appear that he is magnanimously offering berths to congressmen in his ministry since he has been totally weakened by the exit of the pmk and the left but the sad fact is that karunanidhi has no option left
2884964 expect a cabinet reshuffle any day now and it is our turn to ask for plum posts as did the dmk when the upa came to power at the centre four years ago
2884965 what do we gain from a government when we cannot even have the power to get a peon appointed in government service
2884966 we have more than the magic number of 118 the simple majority easily available to us through the backing of 35 mlas belonging to the congress even if one has to eventually subtract the 15 left legislators support in the assembly
2884967 who is there to challenge us but for the bjp whose presence in tamil nadu is a miniscule fraction above zero and the vaiko led mdmk which has six legislators other political parties here arent willing to touch the aiadmk with a bargepole
2884968 we need just 17 cross votes to bring down the dmk government two less than the number that helped manmohan singh win the trust vote on july 22
2884969 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country

2884982 in some cases the state government can seek help from the central paramilitary force but there should be a valid reason behind it people in nandigram should respect the law and order system of the state machinery

2885000 in march 1959 both houses of congress passed the hawaii admission act and u s president dwight d eisenhower signed it into law the act excluded palmyra atoll part of the kingdom and territory of hawaii from the new state on june 27 of that year a referendum was held asking residents of hawaii to vote on accepting the statehood bill hawaii voted at a ratio of 17 to 1 to accept there has been criticism however of the statehood plebiscite because the only choices were to accept the act or to remain a territory without addressing the issues of legality surrounding the overthrow despite the criticism the united nations decolonization committee later removed hawaii from the united nations list of non self governing territories

2885006 developers of new software started after the intel announcement at wwdc 2005 already know the deal use xcode and don t make assumptions about the underlying processor architecture the way apple has set things up with xcode once you re compiling a universal binary it s not that much more work to keep producing universal binaries than it would be to produce binaries for a single architecture

2885010 i just dont think were in a position to know whether these were right policies or wrong policies yet
2885011 but if adobe after researching the matter carefully chooses to save itself an unspecified amount of time and expense by not porting a new version of an existing program to a platform that it was never designed for this is not betrayal arrogance or stupidity
2885012 for example none of the adobe statements seemed to me to be arrogant but you obviously feel differently
2885013 mac users should be happy because adobe brought this software to the mac platform and that alone was enough

2885015 the new blog carnival covering the way science is changing or not changing enough in the 21st century praxis is about to start the call for submissions is now open send them to me at coturnix at gmail dot com by august 14th at midnight eastern
2885016 the giants shoulders is a monthly science blogging event in which authors are invited to submit posts on classic scientific papers submissions are due on the fifteenth of each month and entries will be aggregated and linked to on the host blog of the month links to entries should be sent to that months host blog
2885017 what defines a classic paper this depends upon the field in question but one expects that the work should have somewhat stood the test of time we suggest perhaps 10 years old or more contributors should not only describe the research involved but also put it in a broader historical scientific context why is the work in question important groundbreaking revolutionary nifty
2885018 it should go without saying by the use of the word classic but papers should be in an accepted established scientific field contributions promoting non traditional science and pseudo scientific ideas are inappropriate

2885033 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2885034 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2885035 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2885036 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2885037 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2885038 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2885039 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2885040 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2885041 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2885042 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2885043 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2885044 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2885045 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2885046 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2885047 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2885048 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2885049 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2885050 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2885051 when we saw it we said jim youve got a product here
2885052 theres lots of cities just like us that need this technology
2885053 it seemed so simple we wondered why we didnt think of it before
2885054 i think fuel usage wise its a really smart system
2885055 given the fuel prices i would not be surprised if some of the waste companies as well communities that handle waste are looking more seriously at this type of system
2885056 so this is paying for itself more than we ever anticipated it would when we were developing it
2885057 no because he camilo is my older brother and i respect him i only told him that i will decide accordingly besides there is no offer of a bribe
2885058 wasnt that a criminal act under the revised penal code because it constituted corruption of a public officer and as such there was no need for an offer of a bribe
2885059 i asked some people in the studio who know something about swimming and they all agree that this was the greatest relay in history
2885060 n o tivemos uma competi o justa lutei um pouco contra os rbitros e at sa com vontade de rir
2885061 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2885062 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2885063 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2885064 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2885065 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2885066 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2885067 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2885068 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2885069 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2885070 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2885071 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2885072 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2885073 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2885074 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2885075 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2885076 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2885077 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2885078 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2885079 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2885080 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2885081 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2885082 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2885083 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2885084 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2885085 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2885086 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2885087 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2885088 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2885090 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2885091 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2885092 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2885093 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2885094 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2885095 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2885096 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2885097 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2885098 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2885099 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2885100 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2885101 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2885102 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2885103 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2885104 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2885105 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2885106 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2885107 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2885108 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2885109 who are open to doing something on the production side
2885110 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2885111 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2885112 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2885113 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2885114 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2885115 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2885116 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2885117 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2885118 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2885119 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2885120 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2885121 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2885122 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2885123 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america

2885127 many players regard the unrest in georgia as a new reason to sell the euro as europe relies heavily on russia for oil supplies

2885169 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2885197 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward

2885286 we have 180 minutes now and get 90 more against new zealand so we will improve our game from one game to another
2885287 i think the more minutes we get and the more we play together the more we can get done
2885288 for the last two weeks i have been living a lie i have deceived all 10 blackhawk fans for that i am sorry
2885289 hey babe i was just letting u no that i noticed u and i may consider u to be with me
2885290 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2885291 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2885292 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2885293 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2885294 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2885295 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection

2885298 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2885299 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2885300 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2885301 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2885302 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2885303 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2885304 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2885305 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2885306 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2885307 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2885308 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2885309 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2885310 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2885311 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2885312 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2885319 so how come google takes photos of private homes and nobody stops them and we just have to put up with it
2885320 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that i think it was a matter of timing i didnt know what was unfolding
2885321 these people have fully surrendered their lives to christ demonstrated by their dramatically higher levels of spiritual behaviors and attitudes across the board they very strongly agree that they seek gods guidance in every area of their lives at two times the level of any other segment
2885322 attitudes they love god more than anything for them prayer is constant conversation with god they help to mentor others service to others is a way of life

2885346 we will not allow the west bengal government to weaken the case and see to it that the culprits are punished they deserve to be hanged for their offence

2885358 although native flavours are starting to appear in chutneys sauces and spice blends you wont find crocodile meat in the cold cabinet or lemon myrtle on the spice rack let alone fresh warrigal greens or kakadu plums alongside the salad mix and packham pears
2885359 theres a difference between experiencing something unique once and putting it on the weekly shopping list
2885360 research shows that we gravitate to flavours that taste the most familiar
2885361 with such conservative palates australians are not going to embrace challenging new native flavours

2885364 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around 5 per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
2885365 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2885366 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2885367 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2885368 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are likely to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2885369 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year

sobre todo se encend a el anhelo incontrolado de poseer una figura de ensue o digna de un ser superior una vez conquistado el inter s del var n el halo de la deidad viviente arrastraba a su v ctima lejos del territorio masculino hacia un lugar sin guerra pol tica o comercio un mundo femenino impregnado de hedonismo voluptuosidad y lujo el hombre invitado a tan id lico emplazamiento apenas pod a resistir la intenci n de reposar all para siempre pero justo en el instante en que se acomodaba para recibir el manjar de la anfitriona esta modificaba dr sticamente su actitud los susurros se volv an fr os su porte distante su gesto dese oso la v ctima confundida ve a como los sue os se le esfumaban entre los dedos antes de haberlos alcanzado la ilusi n adquir a rasgos de desesperaci n entonces el potencial viril retornaba emerg a de nuevo para reconquistar el para so de placer imaginado pero en el mundo que se le escapa de nada sirven la brutalidad o la violencia que tan tiles resultan en el terreno de los hombres en el pa s de las mujeres se barajan unas artes mucho m s sofisticadas indirectas e imprecisas a las que l no est acostumbrado cuyas leyes desconoce por ello en la carrera de persecuci n por recuperar lo que una vez crey suyo se va minando su capacidad de reflexi n durante el trayecto el hombre deja de ser anal tico y se vuelve emocional en el siglo xviii se modifica el protagonismo femenino de la seducci n el var n se aficiona a las estratagemas con las que vencer la resistencia sexual de las j venes damas son tiempos de don juan donde en el trato con el sexo opuesto la brutalidad deja paso a la galanter a y la pulsi n sexual se disimula con sutilezas que tradicionalmente pertenec an al elenco femenino los varones extreman el cuidado de su vestimenta en imitaci n a las conductas femeninas lo m s interesante es que los varones conquistan un valioso descubrimiento el pie de barro de las mujeres se sit a en sus o dos las damas no son indiferentes a lo que se dice ni a c mo se dice las palabras colocadas en un determinado modo y pronunciadas en un tono adecuado producen verdaderos sortilegios ayudan a poseer mentes y corazones a medida que avanzan los a os las estrategias de encantamiento ampl an su campo de acci n ya no se restringen al terreno de la conquista sexual sino que se extienden al mbito social los cortesanos ganan favores de sus superiores mediante juegos psicol gicos que siguen fielmente las reglas de seducci n en el siglo xix napol on descubre que la bater a de t cnicas seductoras es v lida tambi n a gran escala la oratoria se convierte en herramienta para atrapar ideas y sensibilidades de las masas la teatralidad el espect culo la arenga ganan terreno al discurso a media voz y procuran un inmenso poder con el que subyugar a los pueblos el atractivo f sico deja paso al magnetismo intelectual el atractivo f sico deja paso al magnetismo intelectual el seductor encandila a gente de todo sexo y condici n cualquier persona es un seducido en potencia as nace el tipo carism tico el l der al que se le atribuyen virtudes de gu a y se le entrega poder un ser al que se sigue por convicci n y no por obligaci n a pesar de la adaptaci n y la transformaci n que siempre otorga el tiempo la anatom a de la seducci n su t cnica contin a vigente desde que la inventasen las mujeres del imperio romano veamos el primero de sus pelda os captar la atenci n sin atenci n no hay seducci n posible como bien saben los publicitarios los l deres pol ticos o de negocios los padres de familia los gur s espirituales y los profesores que conocen las leyes de la buena pedagog a no todos los seductores ejercen un magnetismo similar albergan intenciones id nticas ni todas las personas sucumben al mismo tipo de seducci n la personalidad del seductor su temperamento formaci n e inteligencia atraen a unos destinatarios y repelen a otros dicho de otra forma el seductor acoge deseos exhibe virtudes sufre carencias y es depositario de necesidades como cualquier otro ser humano por ello su inter s se centra en aquellos destinatarios susceptibles al menos en apariencia de alimentar su psicolog a personal no hay que olvidar que seductor y seducido se complementan y alimentan mutuamente por otro lado la persona seductora no encandila constantemente y sin descanso el arte de la fascinaci n exige energ a y cuidado en muchos aspectos resulta verdaderamente agotador el magnetismo de una persona radica en que cerca de ella nos sentimos mejor que cuando est lejos nos la imaginamos poseedora de algo que a nosotros nos falta pero lo que verdaderamente nos atrapa se debe a que se muestra dispuesta a compartirlo incluso en exclusiva si nos portamos convenientemente y respondemos a lo que esperan de nosotros se las arregla para que a su lado nos sintamos importantes nicos y originales en sus ojos vemos reflejada la imagen de nosotros mismos que deseamos poseer y proyectar la persona seductora siempre presta una atenci n extraordinaria al otro ensalza sus virtudes fulmina sus complejos regala aprobaci n a raudales y al hacerlo se garantiza el apego el anhelo es aprobado de ser amado y entendido ejerce una pujanza tal que en cuanto lo saboreamos ligeramente ya no podemos prescindir de ello el mismo tiempo el fascinador en cualquiera de sus versiones preserva para s un trozo del secreto un pedazo del

2885428 rizal reformist or revolutionary late last month prof quibuyen came across the above posting and emailed to request for the sake of fairness that i post his response which i frankly was not aware of thus this posting personally although history is not my profession i have a very deep interest in it history drives me to travel a lot especially to western europe which has much relevance to our spanish cultural heritage that includes some of our acquired native filipino customs values and religiosity for good or bad jose rizal though i think and believe that per definition he was he was a great reformist who wrote to expose the abuses of the spanish rulers and religious friars in the homeland i think and believe that the likes of apolinario mabini was more of a revolutionary nationalistic thinker than rizal mabini the brain of the katipunan urged his fellow filipinos not to give aid to either the spanish or the americans but to capture as much of the islands as possible so that the americans who were sure to be victors would become convinced that here we have a strong and organized people that know how to defend their honor
2885429 i want to tell you something i dont want you to let recto know do you realize that the selection of rizal as national hero for the filipinos was william howard tafts doing
2885430 had created or shall we say added a new religion to the already dozens of rizalistas and cultists in our midst who have not seen nor heard nor spoken evil about rizal
2885431 every positive word or letter of rizal as well as documented
2885432 quibuyen asserts that rizal is indeed a revolutionary theoretician of the 1896 revolution but this kind of rizalism is in danger of becoming a cult if not a religion
2885433 became one of the most widely read interpretations in the 1960s and the era of the first quarter storm
2885434 though sison merely used rizal and his martyrdom to show the futility of reformism and to direct it towards the revolutionary road
2885435 every postive word or letter of rizal as well as documented testimonies to support the view that he was after all a consistent revolutionary
2885436 there were more profound political ideological differences between rizal and del pilar both ilustrados than between rizal and bonifacio
2885437 this book should have been given the title rizal the revolutionary instead as this is the real contention of this book
2885438 a saint to be worshipped a demigod to be transformed into a religion
2885439 rizal did not welcome the revolution when it came but he did not condemn his people for embracing it in his farewell to his people he linked his martyrdom with their revolutionary struggle
2885440 why was rizal willing to serve the spanish army as a medical doctor against the cuban revolutionaries when he was arrested and sentenced to die
2885441 rizal said that his intention in applying for the post of military doctor was to study the war in a practical way go the cuban soldiery if he thought he would find there solutions which would remedy the bad situation in the philippines if he were admitted as a military doctor in cuba he explained he could return to the philippines when the necessity arose
2885442 rizal could have escaped when there was a chance and when the opportunity was offered by the katipunan but he instead told the katipunan that he had even given his word to his colonial captors that he would not escape and behave well
2885443 the third and last sworn testimony given by valenzuela before a civilian court in 1917 which supports his 1914 memoir
2885444 confronted with the option between revolution and martyrdom rizal chose the latter
2885445 the favorable interpretations about rizal written by fr john schumacher cesar adib majul zeus salazar setsuho ikehata igor podveresky and austin coates
2885446 this has nothing to do with the preparations for the games
2885447 there is nothing funny in whats happening it is very sad whats going on in the world

2885488 it just gives you energy for practice and we enjoy that we play in front of the best fans in the nfl and they deserve to come see us practice sometimes its good times
2885489 this was a practice format today and we were here for our fans but it was very important we got our work in

2885492 the current system is not working bail is too easily granted frequently breached and improperly enforced
2885493 public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily
2885494 it is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first

2885526 georgia has implemented far reaching political economic and military reforms
2885527 both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
2885528 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
2885529 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

2885564 in this case there were no compact discs with warnings
2885565 plaintiffs have not introduced any evidence to contradict that defendant did not have an understanding of the nature of file sharing programs and copyright sophisticated enough to have reason to know that her actions infringed plaintiffs copyrights therefore the court finds that a fact issue exists as to whether defendant was an innocent infringer
2885566 oh im sorry please forgive me i shouldve rolled over and played dead i shouldve left my husband and aborted my kid
2885567 youre just gonna have to decide darlin whether youre his daughter or my wife

2885569 with the closure of this new financing we can complete development of the processes needed to produce lithium from brines and effluent streams in an environmentally conscious manner
2885570 we must get there before any more damage has been done
2885571 bill how is your new little one i do hope she laughs often
2885572 when the first baby laughed for the first time its laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all when skipping about and that was the beginning of fairies
2885573 rolfe has been telling me about a shortage they are noticing in fairies in the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures
2885574 the kind of fairies they talk of in these stupid muggle fairytales do not exist
2885575 every time a child says i dont believe in fairies there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead
2885576 but you see it doesnt count im not a child
2885577 i think charlies probably right you really have to do something to fix this now why arent you clapping
2885578 do you believe in fairies if you believe clap your hands dont let her die
2885579 you know perce you are the head of the department of international cooperation now
2885580 its your job to go to this neverland place and see what you can do about getting these neverlandese neverlandians people of neverland to treat the fairies of their world with some respect
2885581 i cant go to this neverland place i dont know how to get there
2885582 second star to the right and straight on till morning
2885583 how can i know what i think until i see what i say
2885584 choosing a female flag bearer for iranian team was a defeating answer to those who wanted to pretend that the women rights are being violated in iran
2885585 putin condemned attempts to politicize the olympics describing them as
2885586 the take home message here is its a big deal
2885587 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2885588 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
2885589 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
2885590 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
2885591 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2885592 dont allow the fruits of the victory achieved through the sacrifices of the mujahedeen fighting in afghanistan iraq and the tribal belt of pakistan to be hijacked by the politicians who sat passively while the girls and boys of the red mosque perished and burned
2885593 these are the same politicians who follow the tenets of an alien western democratic system and judiciary and exploit islam to fulfill their own greedy aims

2885595 burn me once stupid you burn me twice stupid me
2885596 i develop positioning strategies for small businesses that differentiates them i appreciate working with companies who see the value of going beyond mere slogans and have a desire to sell from compelling positions opportunities come to light in every discussion
2885597 they poked us and stabbed us with the machetes and they were asking for money specifically dollars
2885598 we had a few quetzales guatemalas currency but we had no dollars with us on the boat
2885599 i said we need help i said my husband was not moving
2885600 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2885601 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2885602 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect
2885603 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something
2885604 ive had two bikes stolen so i stopped buying bikes because they kept stealing them
2885605 its easier than getting a car out and finding parking
2885606 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2885607 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short

2885630 me parece fundamental el proceso que encabeza evo morales no s lo para bolivia sino para el mundo entero que est enfermo de racismo aunque siga siendo una enfermedad rara vez confesada
2885631 bolivia es parte de m esta en m vaya donde vaya ande donde ande y yo estoy en bolivia sin estar estando dicho sea de paso te cuento que en bolivia tuve hace ya muchos a os mi bautismo de fuego como escritor
2885632 llevaba yo un buen tiempo en llallagua y hab a llegado la hora de partir
2885633 el gusto es para m y les agradezco por haberme invitado
2885634 c mo ver s tengo problemas para respirar porque ya no soy joven pero estoy contento porque para m bolivia significa mucho
2885635 it is hard foreign policy on august 11th 2008 rahmon left china august 8th after attending the opening ceremonies in beijing hopefully he got the chance to cheer on dzakhon kurbanov to overwhelming and surprising victory over the world boxing champion abbos atoev rahmon did apparently find time to talk about geopolitics according to the emomali rahmon and the chairman of the peoples republic of china hu jintao had constructive talks on bilateral and multifaceted relations between the two countries including preparations for a regular summit of the heads of state of the shanghai cooperation organization member states
2885636 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2885637 im not so sure because free parking is such a motivator
2885638 when we have our new facility that argument will no longer carry any weight
2885639 the garage will absorb the increased staff and visitor parking demand resulting form the construction
2885640 i raised all the possibilities they just couldnt do it i feel we did everything possible
2885641 its the same reason theres no real treatment for fire ant bites wasps bees all the things that sting you
2885642 we really see the renewable energy industry as a growing market
2885643 one stop helps streamline and accelerate the business start up process
2885644 it helps companies press through some of the bureaucracy you often find in government
2885645 our entire system is built upon this idea of people standing up and being counted and then being held accountable for their actions come november
2885646 what our general assembly has done is effectively obscure that from the public view
2885647 if some are suggesting that we should spend taxpayer dollars and increase government waste by taking a roll call vote on every measure whether warranted or not i do not think that is a very wise decision
2885648 its not weakening accountability its making efficient use of the time
2885649 if everyone is in agreement why do you need to call their name out one after another
2885650 is there room for improvement yes is it wholesale wrong the way its being done no
2885651 i think there is a real opportunity for the people to see the spending habits of those they elected to represent them and to keep the conscience of every legislator at its peak and also to give accountability and comfort to the public
2885652 other southeastern states mandate roll call voting tell me a reason why other states can do it but south carolina cant do it
2885653 the main reason is so they can have plausible deniability when it comes to their position on various measures
2885654 sometimes you have to stand up and be counted frankly thats what theyve been asked to do
2885655 its a way to reduce that steel and glass barrier were in
2885656 it gives them the ability to walk up to us in an informal environment
2885657 a few years ago we had a lot of vagrants around here
2885658 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2885659 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2885660 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2885661 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2885662 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2885663 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2885664 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2885665 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2885666 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2885667 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2885668 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2885669 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2885670 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2885671 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2885672 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2885673 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2885674 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2885675 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics
2885676 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
2885677 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2885678 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
2885679 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
2885680 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2885681 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2885682 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2885683 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2885684 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2885685 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2885686 we expect to have more people attending than the 800 to 900 who came last year
2885687 general purpose 2k epoxy adhesive suitable for gap filling and vertical applications ideal for bonding metal parts and components non sag paste medium working life excellent chemical resistance
2885688 a heatpipe is a heat transfer mechanism that can transport large quantities of heat with a very small difference in temperature link 2
2885689 fin array allows airflow in any direction fin array maximizes surface area for more effective convection air cooling particularly when air flow is limited this provides an effective heat dissipation
2885690 use internally to prevent copper pipe from kinking when bending size corresponds to external diameter of heatpipe over which the bending spring is fitted
2885691 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2885692 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything
2885693 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2885694 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2885695 in some cases the perpetrator had given indications of coming back this is what had caused the fear
2885696 we are the only museum in this region of texas to host this exhibit
2885697 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories
2885698 the hospital auxiliary has long been dear to my heart
2885699 my mother was a charter member i went to church and school with several current members and many were role models for me as i grew up individually and collectively its members have been the driving force behind projects that have enhanced our lives for over half a century
2885700 wenn ich w sste warum die weltspitze enteilt ist w re ich auch dabei
2885701 im pferdesport ist es so dass die karten immer neu gemischt sind
2885702 ich bin mit noch mehr respekt nach china gefahren weil ich nicht wusste wie das pferd die lange reise bersteht wie das training verl uft wie es die hitze und luftfeuchtigkeit vertr gt ich bin sehr gespannt
2885703 es herrscht eine irrsinnige dichte ich habe an erfahrung dazugelernt aber im pferdesport ist es so dass die karten immer neu gemischt sind du wei t nicht wie das pferd auf die umwelt reagiert wie es sich f hlt an dem tag es z hlt nicht nur meine k rperliche verfassung die psychische die konzentration sondern wirklich auch die vom pferd und das l sst sich auch nur sehr sehr schwer beeinflussen und einsch tzen
2885704 anky van grunsven die macht das schon ich trau mich fast wetten
2885705 bei falci gehts eigentlich aber mal sehen wie es dann sein wird wenn das stadion voll ist was dann f r atmosph re herrscht
2885706 das ist schade wenn man wei was da f r arbeit dahinter steckt aber er hat das einzig richtige getan und im sinne der gesundheit seines pferdes gehandelt
2885707 nach diesen drei wochen bist du eh so ersch pft falci braucht dann eine pause f r ihn war es ja ein riesenaufwand und eine nervliche anstrengung
2885708 v lkerverst ndigung und freundschaft zwischen chinesen und menschen weltweit f rdern
2885709 freie berichterstattung in verschiedenen sprachen ber olympia unter benutzung der m glichkeiten der neuen medien und kommunikationstechniken
2885710 easy fm war f r mich als jugendliche eine absolute entdeckung
2885711 der slogan meiner lieblingsshow always find the joy in your life wurde f r mich lebensleitend
2885712 den leuten ein bisschen gute laune zu machen und sie in ihrem alltag zu begleiten
2885713 wir bersetzen nicht einfach nur das w re f r unsere zweisprachigen h rer zu langweilig sondern wir werfen uns b lle zu und kommentieren das was die andere person sagt
2885714 ich mag single sign ons nicht ich glaube nicht daran
2885715 blinde und sehbehinderte verwenden die ger usche des ankommenden verkehrs als einen hinweis um festzustellen wann es sicher ist die stra e zu berqueren wenn sich ein leises hybridauto n hert fehlt ihnen dieser hinweis und sie sind einer gefahr ausgesetzt
2885716 ihr m sst euch immer an das unm gliche wagen sonst erreicht ihr es nie
2885717 dont worry das ist ein gutes zeichen eine kobra muss sich h uten um wachsen zu k nnen genauso muss dein geist vergangenes verarbeiten und sich reinigen bevor er weiter wachsen kann
2885718 this is a local conflict but there isnt the danger of this becoming a regional conflict in our mind
2885719 were not talking about anything beyond diplomacy at this moment
2885720 to some extent regional actors are simply getting on with their own business
2885721 theres a sense that washington is distracted and its political capital is expended
2885722 if the u s and nato allies will not cause a cease fire and assist georgia in restoring its sovereignty now ukraine may be the next victim
2885723 this is a major threat to the stability and security of europe
2885724 well if you ever find the time call me some time
2885725 were finding clear evidence that working on country has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2885726 the health benefits in terms of reducing levels of high blood pressure diabetes and kidney disease are quite striking when people are actively engaged in looking after their country
2885727 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2885728 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2885729 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country
2885730 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity
2885731 we amp squo re finding clear evidence that working amp squo on country amp squo has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2885732 you have betrayed the students the parents and the school she said
2885733 some other joker beat me to the punch on that one okay well its got bridgeport beer in it right how about the great minds think alike so since it is a sweetened and fortified beer combination which makes it some sort of a
2885734 obviously i was trying to win but thats it its not disappointing
2885735 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2885736 somebodys trying to tell us something but i cant translate their message
2885737 this will be a beautiful beautiful place when were done
2885738 it could have been put there to throw us off
2885739 i see the graffiti there and its telling me that they dont want to see a theater and a restaurant there it sounds crazy to me
2885740 people did not want to come to morse avenue because they were scared weve been building anchors for this community and this was one of the anchors
2885741 the demand for prior withdrawal of the invaders is just and our government supports it cuban president raul castro said in a written statement
2885742 therefore it is false to assert that georgia is now defending its national sovereignty he said
2885743 the demand for prior withdrawal of the invaders is just and our government supports it amp squo amp squo cuban president raul castro said in a written statement
2885744 therefore it is false to assert that georgia is now defending its national sovereignty amp squo amp squo he said
2885745 desde las calles de hanoi hasta las llanuras de frica
2885746 the security team at facebook is dedicated to investigating and auditing our own code for holes as well as reaching out to people in an extended community to let us know if weve missed anything
2885747 they seem to be proactive at dealing with the situation and have shut it down fairly quickly
2885748 they have their own anti spam service within the system and thats what helped it from spreading far and wide
2885749 the issues we saw on pcs 10 or 15 years ago were now seeing on social network platforms
2885750 unless social networks are careful they will be facing the same spam type issues that we see in email spam
2885751 what happened over the past few days is an example of this
2885752 someone created a piece of web code that looked like any standard user generated content but it propagated itself across the network
2885753 the resources sector is dragging the market down but thats to be expected as metal prices were softer overnight
2885754 the banks are all higher but the market is still sceptical about the rally
2885755 i was just getting up but i was getting up from doing something badass
2885756 thats why he wore a headband a lot of the movie covering up the stitches
2885757 im a weatherman but they have this program that they say can modify the weather a method of seeding the clouds that they say they have perfected
2885758 last time tom cruises tropic thunder cameo is not actually all that funny tom cruises tropic thunder cameo is not actually all that funny allow bret easton ellis to introduce you to alison poole a
2885759 they did the best they could but it doesnt really get rid of the noise
2885760 lawyers like to see their deals on the front page of tom cruises tropic thunder cameo is not actually all that funny tom cruises tropic thunder cameo is not actually all that funny allow bret easton ellis to introduce you to alison poole a
2885761 the original commission didnt get to the bottom of anything
2885762 but i think the landlords are going to adjust their expectations
2885763 the government is now taking measures to reduce the difficulties that result from rising prices
2885764 hey but arent we making effing tons more than that just exporting our oil
2885765 petronas has played a major role by giving back a substantial amount of its profits to the government
2885766 since the formation of petronas in 1974 to last year the company gave the government rm335 7bil out of a total profit of rm570bil
2885767 all the oil companies get full market price for the petrol and diesel that they sell and the government pay them the difference from the fixed price this is where the subsidy comes into play
2885768 while the industry is stepping up efforts to bring more energy to the market much needs to be done on the consumer end to ensure that greater energy efficiency is achieved
2885769 while this is being pursued nations must also work towards a gradual removal of generous energy subsidies which cause unmitigated consumption and market distortions that are unmanageable in the long run
2885770 an investigation would not reveal anything more than what we already know in my view we need to look at restoring the integrity of the judiciary
2885771 another investigation inquiry or commission will just reveal what we have revealed before i think we should move on and not waste more of taxpayers money
2885772 indeed based on the arguments of the commission itself i can say that possibly it was set up in order to find something to pin on me to drag me to court etc and generally humiliate me
2885773 if we can look at the government and the laws by all means do that study the law the so called restrictive laws and make representations to the relevant minister and the government but what i want to talk to you today is can the press today start looking at itself
2885774 im not here to endorse anything ive not read or considered
2885775 i am not acting on any pressure i am doing this because umno under abdullah has forgotten its roots its struggle for the party for the malays and for the nation
2885776 please take note that we are not gathering at dataran merdeka to walk to the npc
2885777 when prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi announced that the anti corruption agency aca will go through thorough reform i sense that he is committed in changing things
2885778 now that i am free we can focus on getting anwar ibrahim out of prison
2885779 if pm abdullahs secretaries want to talk about politics i have no problem
2885780 were going to smash them thats what we came for
2885781 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2885782 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2885783 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2885784 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2885785 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2885786 nearly 80 per cent of people do their shopping in supermarkets
2885787 although native flavours are starting to appear in chutneys sauces and spice blends you wont find crocodile meat in the cold cabinet or lemon myrtle on the spice rack let alone fresh warrigal greens or kakadu plums alongside the salad mix and packham pears
2885788 theres a difference between experiencing something unique once and putting it on the weekly shopping list
2885789 research shows that we gravitate to flavours that taste the most familiar
2885790 with such conservative palates australians are not going to embrace challenging new native flavours
2885791 its tremendously difficult to hot wire a car thats fitted with an engine immobiliser
2885792 the electronic device disrupts critical components needed to start the vehicles engine
2885793 the mandatory installation of immobilisers in new cars and improved vehicle safety is driving down car theft
2885794 all motorists should invest in an immobiliser and remain vigilant with their keys
2885795 tough laws and heavy penalties send a strong message to potential offenders but prevention is still the best cure
2885796 each stolen car is factored into car insurance premiums and hits the hip pocket of every driver
2885797 a move in november is a likelihood rather than september he said
2885798 theres still a fair bit of talk of elevated inflation and that suggests theyll wait for the next consumer price index cpi before they move
2885799 while the central bank says that scope for rate cuts is increasing it falls short of saying that the time for lower rates has arrived mr james said
2885800 the reserve bank is tip toeing rather than striding down the path of rate cuts
2885801 we believe that the reserve bank has laid the groundwork for a rate cut but the timing and size of any rate move is dependent on economic data to be released over the next few weeks
2885802 if the next batch of economic readings are as dreadful as we have seen over the past month then rates could be cut as early as september
2885803 extremely tight financial conditions are bringing the australian economy to a screeching halt and policymakers next month will decide on the size of their first response mr robertson said
2885804 on the 25 or 50 basis point question there are arguments both ways so at this stage it remains a coin flip
2885805 scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2885806 fallen significantly in recent months and the overall growth of credit had slowed along with the global economy strong commodities prices were still bolstering the australian economy the rba said
2885807 prospects for growth of the australian economy and for inflation will continue to depend on the net effects flowing from these opposing forces it said
2885808 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2885809 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2885810 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2885811 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2885812 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2885865 this is the toughest funny car era to be racing in so bad luck on my part
2885866 this is my first win at brainerd and im really happy to win here every round today was a big challenge to me and the toughest was racing john force hes a great competitor and it was a tough race like i thought theres never a dull moment racing him our car preformed well today and we had great conditions im just happy to win a race here today and give great entertainment to all these great fans
2885867 we were a little behind at first and kept working on it and the car kept getting faster and faster we had to make some small changes today but overall our chevrolet was pretty flawless we get pumped up to race here with all of our friends and family that come out and it does add some pressure but you just have to perform once i get inside the car its really easy to focus

2885876 i went and checked and the ones i saw were lawns that were filled in currie said
2885877 they had it marked in as a culvert replacement and thats not proper bookkeeping
2885878 when we the conservatives came into power it was fairly rampant that you got a culvert because of who you were and who you knew in government he said
2885879 any number of things could cause us to replace a pipe early on maynard said
2885880 they can put a pipe in and then have to do repairs at any one time because of a deep ditch the way the installation went in if there are some erosion problems that it has to be reset or moved around or to get it so that it works better
2885881 yes we put it in early on when they wanted it in and it had to get moved maynard said
2885882 and they would have just put the same pipe back in again but since it was on a different street they had to put a different size in
2885883 i know culverts are getting put in that shouldnt have been put in lawns are getting filled in for people that wasnt supposed to be done money not getting paid for it and everything else he said
2885884 it didnt sit well with me at all i thought it was wrong what was getting done with the taxpayers money getting used and wasted that way and i wanted to bring to attention whats going on
2885885 a lot of people just turn their heads the other way he said

2885937 what you will see is that kobe will be marketed a little differently thats inevitable because a change in public perception is something that cant be denied or avoided
2885938 we were all on our e mails during the second half of the game to make sure it would go up on the internet quickly
2885939 our fans have the expectation to see it own it watch it it feels like one of those turning points in the sports industry
2885940 hes not doing anything outside the game that would mitigate the negative reaction significantly
2885941 you dont see remorse those who do show it bounce back quickly

2885951 i dont know what it was like with the beatles but from what ive seen on tv its very close
2885952 peoples reactions to kobe alone are pretty crazy i have to walk the other way its sheer excitement i saw a guy kobe gave him an autograph and he took off running and laughing and jumping that must have been pretty special to him he went to go tell his friends about it
2885953 i am fortunate enough to have played in four nba finals and numerous big games but it was just different you felt like there was so much more support because its the usa and obviously how proud the fans are here of their country
2885954 you just understood that there was something that was bigger than the game it wasnt just a finals game or a seventh game it was bigger than that
2885955 it was a great feeling he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you so go out there and kick some butt

2885986 were finding clear evidence that working on country has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2885987 the health benefits in terms of reducing levels of high blood pressure diabetes and kidney disease are quite striking when people are actively engaged in looking after their country
2885988 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2885989 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2885990 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country
2885991 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity

2886009 few people know the city of mount vernon and the needs of its citizens as well as karen who will help us better serve the people who live there
2886010 she also has deep experience managing recreation organizations that are similar to the ymca were pleased to have karen join us because she has great ideas for new programs and ways to improve the ymcas facilities
2886011 parents and their children have always turned to the ymca to participate in sports and other activities this is a time when we must now step up to serve the community need as never before
2886012 the tight school budgets are creating enormous pressures on families right now
2886013 there will be a tremendous need for after school activities and athletics that we hope to meet by starting new sports leagues clubs and other programs we feel it is important that the ymca is there to take care of mount vernons children there are very challenging times ahead for the mount vernon community
2886014 there are so many new services that wed like to provide but we simply dont have the space

2886023 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2886024 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2886025 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2886026 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2886027 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2886028 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

2886030 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2886031 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2886032 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2886033 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2886034 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2886035 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2886036 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2886037 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2886038 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2886039 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2886040 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2886041 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2886042 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2886043 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2886044 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2886045 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2886046 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2886047 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2886048 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2886049 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2886050 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2886051 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2886052 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2886053 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2886054 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2886055 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2886056 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2886057 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2886058 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2886059 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2886060 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2886061 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2886062 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2886063 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2886064 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2886065 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2886066 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2886067 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2886068 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2886069 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2886070 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2886071 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2886072 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2886073 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2886074 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2886075 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2886076 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2886077 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2886078 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2886079 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2886080 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2886081 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2886082 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2886083 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2886084 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2886085 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2886086 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2886087 if we can get you between 20 and 30 percent gas mileage increase
2886088 thats kind of what were shooting for with our customers were buying you two to three months of free driving a year
2886089 my fuel economy is exactly the same whether the hho generator is turned on or not
2886090 we really feel like if we do everything right on the obd iis that we can get you to that 20 to 30 percent range of gas savings fairly confidently
2886091 whether its alan wongs or a plate lunch a run on the beach some enjoyment with his family hes kind of doing more or less what we do and its just a thrill to share the experience
2886092 its a great thing to have a presidential candidate here its great for the candidate but its really uplifting for the whole community i think people who arent mainstream democrats feel this is really a wonderful moment for hawaii
2886093 we had a lot of people at the last minute fortunately offering to volunteer for the friday event and so we were well staffed out there
2886094 now we have people at the headquarters doing things like getting ready for the national convention button making and theyll be more activities going on to get ready for the national convention
2886095 which is a way to kind of trade relationships with the delegates from all over the country and build a network
2886096 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
2886097 we should also see a gap up opening with positive international cues and with oil cooling off
2886098 if the campaign is about the issues mccain has no chance
2886099 oils slide from record highs has soothed stagflationworries prompting investors to buy both stocks and governmentbonds today
2886100 this is positive to the market in the short term but westill have to keep an eye on how this story will end finally
2886101 and dont appoint a gray bureaucrat to this job make it someone like arnold schwarzenegger or mike bloomberg who would capture the imagination of the public

2886112 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2886113 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2886114 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2886115 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2886116 you told me more about the process than i know
2886117 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2886118 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2886119 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2886120 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2886121 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2886122 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2886123 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2886124 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals
2886125 people who regularly practice grateful thinking reap emotional physical and interpersonal benefits

2886128 i believe the more time w e spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be
2886129 in the depression years and there may be years like them in the future we saw this same suggestive force working overtime day after day we heard the expressions times are hard business is poor the banks are failing prosperity hasnt a chance and wild stories about business failures on every hand until they became the national chant and millions believed that prosperous days would never return hundreds yes thousands of strong willed men go down under the constant hammering the continuous tap tapping of the same fear vibratory thoughts money always sensitive runs to cover when fear suggestions begin to circulate and business failures and unemployment follow quickly we hear thousands of stories and people believe them readily and act accordingly there will never be another business depression if people generally realize that it is with their own fear thoughts that they literally create hard times they think hard times and hard times follow
2886130 i heard that you could make something out of nothing
2886131 if it werent for bad luck ild have no luck at all
2886132 i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate ultra electronics for being selected to supply this key capability for australias future awds
2886133 the selection of the sonar system is a key milestone for the awd alliance and represents the first of a series of important equipment selections the team will make in the next few months
2886134 i also note ultra electronics has committed to undertake more than 50 per cent of its awd sonar systems work in australia which represents a great result for australian industry
2886135 winning is not a sometime thing its an all the time thing you dont win once in a while you dont do things right once in a while you do them right all the time winning is a habit unfortunately so is losing
2886136 every time a football player goes to play his trade hes got to play from the ground up from the soles of his feet right up to his head
2886137 running a football team is no different than running any other kind of organization an army a political party or a business the principles are the same the object is to win to beat the other guy maybe that sounds hard or cruel i dont think it is
2886138 it is a reality of life that men are competitive and the most competitive games draw the most competitive men thats why they are there to compete to know the rules and objectives when they get in the game the object is to win fairly squarely by the rules but to win
2886139 and in truth ive never known a man worth his salt who in the long run deep down in his heart didnt appreciate the grind the discipline
2886140 we worked really hard on these new songs and i havent been this excited about a new record since the 80s yep still call it a record
2886141 rick delivered a very strong rock record that not only appeals directly to his core fans but also engages new fans who discover him
2886142 what is a deist if you dont mind me asking
2886143 deism is the belief that a supreme god exists and created the physical universe but does not intervene in its normal operation furthermore its based on philosophy and cannot in any way be correlated with the bible or the book of mormon as neither of these are philosophical books but only provide fantastic specific methods but lack any ideas of reason
2886144 are you guys having any luck out here tonight theres a lot of christians in this neighborhood
2886145 i know that but the rest of the christians dont agree with this and i know theres a bunch around here so you better be careful
2886146 do you really believe that god doesnt intervene in our daily lives
2886147 a week ago the blow motor for my vent system went out and i asked god if you are real and are involved in our daily lives then please fix this blow motor
2886148 guys its the middle of august in missouri if ever god would need to fix a blow motor this would be the time but he didnt fix it so i keep paper towels in the back seat to wipe the sweat off my face before i enter the office building
2886149 look guys i have practiced about everything on gods green earth except the piano and i when i do actually practice something i do it thoroughly i understand mormonism to some degree and hell i even think you guys are christians which is more than what other christians in this neighborhood think im just saying that you are spinning your tires here boys
2886150 we just want you to know that god is loving and wants the best for his children
2886151 have you guys ever met god and talked to him
2886152 how in the world do you know god is loving then if you never met the ol boy
2886153 if god involves himself in our daily lives as you both believe then i want a piece of god because quite frankly i wish one of two things one that he stays completely the hell out of my life or two that he stops screwing up with me and gets it right
2886154 mr myers is there anything we can do for you right now
2886155 mr myers how in the world did you know my name you guys are better than the bill collectors i hope you dont share this information

2886179 the resources sector is dragging the market down but thats to be expected as metal prices were softer overnight
2886180 the banks are all higher but the market is still sceptical about the rally
2886181 were finding clear evidence that working on country has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2886182 the health benefits in terms of reducing levels of high blood pressure diabetes and kidney disease are quite striking when people are actively engaged in looking after their country
2886183 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2886184 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2886185 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country
2886186 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity
2886187 the demand for prior withdrawal of the invaders is just and our government supports it cuban president raul castro said in a written statement
2886188 therefore it is false to assert that georgia is now defending its national sovereignty he said

2886190 russia has applied unprecedented military power and it is of such amplitude that it would have scared much bigger states
2886191 this war has changed the whole system of values of pro western liberal minded people i dont want to be a bad prophet but why would russia stop here there are other countries where russia thinks it has a claim to territory
2886192 very many military servicemen were killed probably in the hundreds

2886214 the tour has been awesome to this point and very enjoyable we have played places that we have never been before and the reaction has been great
2886215 it is nice to see the great reaction here in the states to the band and it has been so good that we have already booked return dates to alot of the same venues for the future
2886216 we are extremely stoked about being a part of the metal blade family it is a great home for us and we know together we are going to accomplish everything we have set out to do and so much more when the record is released i dont think we are gonna see home much we plan to tour for pretty much the rest of our natural lives
2886217 with the growing number of young aggressive thrash bands rising up across america we were struck down by the sheer brutality and innovative sound of lazarus a d we brought james murphy onboard to mix the new album as metal blade gets ready to unleash the onslaught that is lazarus in early 2009

2886223 a lot of those camps and practices are closed off but it feels good to come out here and practice and hear the fans go ooh and aah with the big catches interceptions and big hits
2886224 it just gives you energy for practice and we enjoy that we play in front of the best fans in the nfl and they deserve to come see us practice sometimes its good times
2886225 this was a practice format today and we were here for our fans but it was very important we got our work in
2886226 were not in a position where we can have a practice that isnt full speed for us right now so i was pleased with the way our guys worked
2886227 it was good to see rob compete rob heard me whisper that so he whispered to hiram about 10 yards ahead of him to go cover him so it really didnt work

2886274 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2886275 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2886276 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country
2886277 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity

2886293 if you think youre too small to make a difference youve never been in bed with a mosquito
2886294 im quite aware of how good this team is its the best team ive ever seen
2886295 were racing against great teams its a lot of pressure but i love those situations its amazing to be a part of these moments i feel like im driving my best i feel like im doing a good job keeping the car in the center of the lane i feel like im part of the team right now
2886296 the day went as planned lets have the right people go out so we can start moving up in the points everyone was talking about clinching a spot in the countdown before indy but that still doesnt deny the fact that i still want to win drag races and make a statement and catch up to my teammate who is no 1 in the standings thats really what we were looking at just moving up in the points
2886297 and we did that today and we made some ground up in some areas that u s army car was bad all weekend long thats all there is to it crew chief mike green and assistant crew chief neal strausbaugh and all the fram guys are awesome they had my back all day my lights werent good and didnt come around until the semis and the final tony and i were awfully close leaving the starting line together and it was a great drag race we ran a 3 90 and they ran a 3 86 and its just one of those things theyre a great team and theyre tough to beat
2886298 i have never won in brainerd and this is a big achievement
2886299 there is never a bad time for a win but this was really important because were trying to get back in that no
2886300 i have to have a certain amount of confidence and i have to remind myself of that
2886301 you take all this stuff away and i think im pretty humble because of where i come from and how i was brought up i look across the pit and see don schumachers team and john forces and i was in the stands watching these guys i was kid taking pictures of force when i was 12 years old that part of me will never change but theres a competitive nature that was instilled in me when i was a child i know what its like to be on the top and i know what its like to be on the bottom and i dont want to go back there
2886302 beckman is tough too but sometimes you can force people to make mistakes when your car is running well and our car is running well right now
2886303 i changed my routine a little bit i went to take a little bump stage deeper because it was the final round and lane choice isnt a big deal because there is no next round my brain told my right foot to go and the light hadnt come on yet absolutely 100 percent a drivers mistake
2886304 the valvoline mts dodge guys gave us a car that could win this race today we ran great all four rounds it was a great weekend points wise we couldnt have asked for much more it could have been an outstanding weekend if id been effective in the final im really disappointed but weve got a race in a week im going to get over it the valvoline mts dodge guys are over it already everybody is excited that our car is predictable and repeatable now
2886305 we were a little behind at first and we kept tuning on it and kept paying attention to what we needed to be doing and the car kept getting faster and faster
2886306 that chevrolet was flawless today we had to make some small changes to it but it does add pressure especially since you know the car is going to be fast if you miss the tree you can be quicker at the finish line and still lose it definitely adds pressure and you have to perform it costs a lot of money to run these cars and the driver has to perform to keep my job i have to do what i have to and its all on the tree thats free horsepower and ive never seen free horsepower in the dyno room
2886307 its obviously big anytime i can win a race in brainerd because this is my home track and we have a lot of support here
2886308 it can be a distraction but when they close the door and i pull into the water i have no distractions at all

2886316 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2886317 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2886318 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2886319 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2886320 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2886321 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2886322 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2886323 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2886437 the church is solely a place for prayer and worship
2886438 second and third generation muslim immigrants have a different approach to western society than the previous one they perceive themselves as an integral part of it
2886439 muslims in europe and their societies of origin in asia and africa
2886440 the speculation that the position regarding the new commission composition is under discussion is just that speculation
2886441 what this does illustrate is the very difficult position that will apply when it comes to appointing the eu commission that takes office from 2009
2886442 the reality is that under the nice treaty under which we are operating at the moment the commission must be reduced to less than 27 when it takes office late next year
2886443 it would reform the currently dreadful arrangements for managing the eus common foreign policy the switch to majority voting on justice and home affairs would improve the quality of decisions in that area
2886444 al barzani wished to issue an open message for dialogue promoting fraternity and looking to the good of the population
2886445 helps to eliminate barriers and is the point of departure for a search for a common solution
2886446 the work of all is needed beginning with the politicians called to put it into practice through daily effort
2886447 promotes shared responsibility the country has been ruined and it is up to all of us to rebuild it through a united effort we can do it
2886448 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province brigadier dawson said
2886449 shadow governor responsible for authorising bomb attacks across the province
2886450 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan brigadier dawson said
2886451 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province brigadier dawson said
2886452 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people
2886453 local people who mostly live in poverty have heard about trillions of rupiah to be distributed to them but many papuans still die due to poor sanitation where does the money go
2886454 may want to ride onto the platform of the olympics to showcase their activities said wei
2886455 their aim is to split up the motherland such activities are not allowed in any country
2886456 we now need to take account of the decision of a significant number of anglican bishops not to attend this lambeth conference
2886457 in such a scenario who will our dialogue partner be should we and how can we appropriately and honestly engage in conversations also with those who share catholic perspectives on the points currently in dispute and who disagree with some developments within the anglican communion or particular anglican provinces
2886458 we know from experience that once cittaslow has gained a foothold in the town you are in big trouble
2886459 the padma purana states lord rama broke the bridge after rescuing sita and according to the hindu faith something that is broken cannot be worshipped
2886460 this is why nobody has till date declared it a monument
2886461 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
2886462 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
2886463 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
2886464 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
2886465 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
2886466 bukan sekedar iseng tetapi melainkan dari hati yang sehari hari emang rada ngelantur
2886467 ive been planning this for a while but now everything is happening very quickly
2886468 that nothing i mean nothing is at code not the electrical not the plumbing not the structure
2886469 i have equity in the current house my credit is terrific but im a musician my income is zero
2886470 but they said they are local and can make the their own rules
2886471 a neighbor told me that it was going to be torn down
2886472 but whats best for a neighborhood why is highest and best use only financial arent these homes a good thing too
2886473 the permits are really important its really our core work
2886474 this is a program that is not just underfunded its critically underfunded to the point that there are aspects of the program that are dysfunctional
2886475 their ability to do compliance and enforcement work is severely compromised
2886476 the economys down right now and everyone is forced to cut back
2886477 on the other hand you want a program that works
2886478 you can see all the leaks that get on the ground around here
2886479 its kind of overwhelming when i drive around looking for trouble and assessing whats going on
2886480 a little extra resources would let us be a little more broad and a little more thorough
2886481 if there wasnt a consequence for speeding i think interstate 5 would look like an autobahn
2886482 we need clearly to have both enforcement and technical assistance
2886483 running the program now and saying they feel like theyre understaffed
2886484 but permits are getting written and issued its not obvious to me why they need another 100 plus people in the program
2886485 we think its a lot more than we have now
2886486 when drinks americas approached me about going into business with them i knew there was a lot of competition out there but it was the same way when i started doing music im going to put the best product out there because thats what i do
2886487 we must refuse to accept that low socioeconomic status makes it ok for poorer children to fail school
2886488 while higher levels of investment in struggling schools and low socioeconomic communities will help thats not the whole answer
2886489 as a nation we should then be tracking attainment knowing that we are in the powerful position of comparing like schools with like schools
2886490 if two schools have comparable school populations but widely varying results we would be able to ask the question why and ascertain the answer
2886491 we should be able to identify best practice and innovation and work systematically to ensure that they are spread more widely
2886492 we should be able to especially assist those schools that need it
2886493 if you still want me to run i will run
2886494 yeah its true but its a personal matter and i wont discuss it
2886495 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen

2886499 we cannot disbelieve the version of police officials who witnessed the encounter we have to believe somebody
2886500 theyre not going to give them to you for free
2886501 dap is also disappointed that deputy prime minister datuk seri najib razaks irresponsible remarks in condoning extreme hooligan and rowdy behaviour that disrupted a forum held by the bar council and threats of using the internal security act against the bar council is a desperate attempt to revive the waning political fortunes of barisan nasional
2886502 now that bn can no longer respond to charges of corruption mismanagement abuse of power and waste they are playing with fire by using religion to frighten the people
2886503 for a future prime minister to defend such extreme and rowdy behaviour is a genuine cause of concern for malaysias future as a harmonious and peaceful multi racial society that guarantees freedom of religion
2886504 however matters relating to religion cannot be reduced or defined by mere declarations of principles or intent alone as real people and human sufferings are involved understanding and compassion is necessary
2886505 we should understand the pain and suffering of a malay muslim family if their child whom they had so lovingly brought up as a muslim suddenly converts out of islam and becomes a non muslim as they say like cutting out ones own flesh
2886506 similarly we should also see the pain and suffering of a non malay family of cutting ones own flesh when their child converts to islam against their wishes to marry a muslim and when he or she wants to revert back to his or her old religion after the marriage breaks down to marry again is prevented from doing so
2886507 just as we understand why malay muslims are so emotional when malay muslims convert out of islam we should also understand the same feelings of non muslims when non malay non muslims who convert to islam are prevented from reverting back to their original religion
2886508 if we can see through such sufferings of muslims and non muslims through the prism of dialogues and compassion instead of absolute laws religious edicts and moral certitude by lessening their sufferings we would have made malaysia a more cohesive and harmonious society
2886509 it is regrettable that some members of political parties such as pas pkr and umno were involved in the almost violent demonstration
2886510 such issues and procedures if left unresolved without good mutual understanding will continue to haunt the multi religious society of malaysia
2886511 he hoped that the bar council got the message that there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
2886512 four members of hindraf were arrested for creating an awareness of their cause at the recent commonwealth parliamentary association conference on aug 7 but here you have over 300 protesters behaving aggressively carrying inciting banners and storming into the bar council forum raising uncalled for racial sentiments against fellow malaysians without fear and protected by the police
2886513 the statement by the home minister appears to be condoning such violent behaviour and supporting hooliganism and claims he has not received any complaints of threats to national security or disturbance to public order are utter rubbish and nonsensical
2886514 es interessiert mich nicht das nbc die serie am 9 oktober starten will es interessiert mich auch nicht dass molly shannon und selma blair die hauptrollen spielen ich sage diese serie wird niemals das tageslicht erblicken

2886516 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2886517 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2886518 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2886519 very refreshing i think he mightve been half expecting to get pinch hit for
2886520 we got a little help today to get a little momentum going and we took advantage of that
2886521 its lucky we came out of here with two out of three with the way we played
2886522 even with guys in scoring position theyve gone right after guys and challenged them
2886523 it helps because you get normal rest for other guys he greinke misses his turn but we just reschedule it
2886524 you know what ill be honest with you im tired of making people money seriously im the
2886525 i was talking with my wife last night and i say all the money they take away just because you say something its a lot of money im not going to continue to contribute all of my money i can do a lot of things with that money
2886526 when they take that kind of money im not going to put up with that
2886527 ill protect my players and do what i have to do but thats a lot of money and i dont know if people appreciate that i take money away from my kids
2886528 its a smoother transition for me because i know a lot of guys in this clubhouse
2886529 im excited to get a fresh start its a new beginning i have a lot of great memories in colorado unfortunately it didnt work out im excited to be here
2886530 el hombre es capaz de hablar s lo sobre lo que no es y a decir la verdad es capaz de hablar solamente sobre lo que no es el hombre habla sobre lo que todav a no es sobre lo que ya no es y fracasa lamentablemente cuando trata de hablar sobre lo que es siempre hemos confesado que la verdad no se expresa pero se vive se vive fuera del lenguaje pues el lenguaje no es un instrumento destinado a enunciar lo que es pero a expresar lo que no satisface al hombre y a formular lo que desea su contenido no est formado por lo que es sino por lo que no es
2886531 yo me entiendo porque me pertenezco a m porque mi pensamiento me pertenece y porque estoy inmerso en l
2886532 cada uno tiene su manera de amar y odiar y este amor este odio refleja su personalidad entera sin embargo el lenguaje designa estos estados con las mismas palabras para todos los hombres as el lenguaje pudo fijar solamente el aspecto objetivo e impersonal del amor del odio y de los miles de sentimientos que alteran el alma
2886533 es el sonido articulado la palabra que solo nos ofrece una existencia donde lo externo y lo interno est n tan ntimamente unidos
2886534 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2886535 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2886536 this is the most prestigious fireworks competition in the world
2886537 this year we finally said lets give it a shot

2886540 resurrecting allegheny city the land structures amp people of pittsburghs north side
2886541 its my feeling that the city has abandoned us its very discouraging to those of us who are trying to make a difference
2886542 i didnt know the severity of the damage until the next morning in the daylight
2886543 and yet it seems the citys busier helping north shore development the stadium authority sells a property to the steelers for 1 3 million when its worth close to 10 million almost a 9 million difference thats almost 9 million that could help neighborhoods i know its not just that simple but its a signal
2886544 i wanted to be part of this community and i feel i am supposed to be here
2886545 i felt the heat and called back and said im in danger
2886546 it just feels like were a scene of fires to the city
2886547 but theres a bigger picture that were trying hard to change
2886548 as costs go through the roof there has to be a day of reckoning
2886549 the scary part is that nobody knows when this is going to end or how this is going to be fixed
2886550 it also takes energy to heat the aggregate heat the asphalt and sand operate the plant truck asphalt to the job site and run the pavers shuttle buggies and rollers and right now were paying 4 70 a gallon for diesel
2886551 you dont have to drive very far to see that a lot of good work is being done but as we move forward well have to prioritize projects there are no new resources coming available so well have to take 9 2 million from next years budget
2886552 weve been losing substantial purchasing power over a number of years
2886553 while penndots mission is to minimize the impact on motorists at the end of the day we cant spend more than we collect these are very difficult times
2886554 every time we ran a trip we picked up 450 patients from first aid stations field hospitals off the roads or in fields and escorted them back to a port
2886555 the last lecture is much more the kind of programming that pbs would bring its viewers year round it creates the emotional reaction and has the inspirational aspect that we think will be very effective
2886556 ninety percent of the people here were nice to us the government was not
2886557 i could be in here six months a year two years it doesnt matter because im from kazakhstan
2886558 if these people are going to remain in the country its important to us
2886559 if not we dont have an interest its not like a homicide or a rape or something like that
2886560 my father will have to work for another year to pay for this
2886561 even if theyre not allowed to come back for a while its better than this
2886562 we gave up on being angry now we just want to go home
2886563 its taken pennsylvania 12 years since legislative proposals on the issue began to get to where we are today
2886564 this isnt the kind of thing where everybodys going to be able to reach complete agreement on all the issues
2886565 i dont believe they understand the financial concerns and some of the costs homes will incur to become assisted living residences
2886566 dont go far enough to ensure adequate care is provided in safe surroundings these regulations just do not cover all the critical bases
2886567 its not perfect for consumers but there has to be a balance in that we want providers to be able to provide this service
2886568 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2886569 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2886570 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2886571 was heute passiert ist ist nicht nur f r die bolivianer sondern f r alle lateinamerikaner wichtig

2886574 insgesamt bin ich mit meiner leistung in peking zufrieden ich kann doch nichts daf r dass die weltspitze so weit weg ist
2886575 you can look at this as half empty or half full all in all im happy because we did a lot of things well to be in a position to win
2886576 its hard to believe it got under the wall guzan said
2886577 but if we get the result against nigeria well forget all about this
2886578 our knee jerk reactions were like any other human beings we were angry we were upset
2886579 as a male sport we tend to hide our feelings a lot but there was definitely a moment where guys let off how they felt about the situation how they felt about hugh not being on the bench
2886580 the best way we can honor them is to go out and play hard larsen said
2886581 this is quite a personal loss for us but hugh told us wed all be stronger for it
2886582 ive played in many big games but the energy tonight was different
2886583 i think they knew that history was being made tonight obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it is for ours you could feel the electricity it was enough to make your spine tingle a little bit
2886584 the excitement of it the anxiousness of it the anticipation was just crazy
2886585 im kind of glad its out of the way now this game was just over the top
2886586 he basically came up to us and said im here to support you our country supports you and so go out there and kick some butt bryant said
2886587 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back
2886588 i could have taken the line of the shot but that would have put me in the stands or i could have gone back to the tee i had to go in there and try to hit something
2886589 i would have liked to obviously play better but i had a good week
2886590 i had my ups and downs had a little go of it early in the round and tried to make a move
2886591 i love ben curtis a lot and i love the fact hes made the team
2886592 i just wanted to shoot something good and see what happened
2886593 i thought maybe i could catch boo but he was playing right in front of me so i knew by the last few holes that wasnt going to happen
2886594 he was very good its nice to see him back
2886595 hopefully he got his second wind and he can do what he did in the first half
2886596 they score an awful lot of runs and if you make a mistake they dont foul it off they hit it
2886597 but we are a strong team we will never fall down and stay down we will always come back up
2886598 we went out and showed the world and every team out there what were here for
2886599 im confident well be stronger on team finals now that all this dramas out of the way
2886600 two of the things on this primitive planet that keep me sane
2886601 i wanted to go 1 45 and if it werent for that messed up finish i would have done it
2886602 i just wanted to save as much energy as possible for the relay
2886603 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
2886604 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2886605 youve got to tip your hat to somebody that does something like that in a pressure packed race like that thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2886606 i hated every minute of what happened in 04 ive always told myself that the character of a person or at least an athlete is discovered when they have to deal with failure unfortunately that was my shining moment because it was the biggest failure of my career to date
2886607 i just got to go home and take care of myself its going to be a tight final natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2886608 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final

2886614 you really have to be of the mindset that you want to change your life and you dont have to go to extremes to do it
2886615 cutting your portions of energy dense foods incorporating more physical activity and doing simple things are really going to make a difference over time i was very excited that it was written by a registered dietitian thats always a good thing
2886616 flavor is an important part of health and weight loss
2886617 with most diets youre counting the days until its over they dont stick with you as a lifestyle
2886618 theres a high expectation in the sonoma diet that people are going to be cooking a lot
2886619 i like to encourage people to cook but the truth is that a lot of people dont have a lot of time
2886620 the first wave is the most extreme the most low calorie
2886621 i dont know anyone whos followed the program but id be surprised if they didnt lose weight

2886870 im not trying to hit into a double play but thats the result theres not really much to say
2886871 i just hit it so high i was hoping it would blow over the fence
2886872 its kind of do or die you hope you have a grip i dont think anyone ever catches that with two fingers on the ball youre kind of throwing with your whole hand i definitely wish i had made a better throw it kind of short hopped tek and allowed a run to score
2886873 i was going home thats why im playing in there if weve got a chance were not going to give up that run just to get the second out
2886874 he was getting stiffer and stiffer as the game progressed it was harder to get loose
2886875 he was still throwing great which makes it harder to put together because hes been so effective
2886876 missing two starts is not what were shooting for but pitching at half speed for the last 10 isnt either we think if we act now this will really be favorable
2886877 well see when i wake up today how i feel hopefully ill be in there tonight
2886878 its been bothering me for like four days now it got better then it got a little worse i just needed a day to help me calm it down a little bit
2886879 lowrie actually was limping a little bit yesterday after he hit that ball off his foot
2886880 it just makes sense weve got a quick turnaround i kind of like playing ac anyway this way he can show his brother white sox coach joey hes the best player in the league
2886881 were finding clear evidence that working on country has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2886882 the health benefits in terms of reducing levels of high blood pressure diabetes and kidney disease are quite striking when people are actively engaged in looking after their country
2886883 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2886884 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2886885 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country
2886886 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity

2886960 its a bad pull he hit the base and it was after he hit the base his first step he tried to decelerate tried to stop really quick after he hit
2886961 obviously the best thing to do would have been to keep running but that load of trying to stop real quick is what caused it
2886962 the other one just kind of felt like a bad cramp
2886963 this one i felt it heard it kind of pop
2886964 its a very significant pull and i dont know if well see willie again the rest of this year
2886965 willie plays so hard that if you get him back you know he going to go hard so youd have to know hes absolutely 100 percent before you bring him back because hell pull it again
2886966 this game has a way of humbling you one way or another

2886977 he got a couple of pitches up deeper in the count and they had seen a few and they got him
2886978 we are vulnerable to that pitch and it can be devastating sometimes r a doesnt even know where its going to go
2886979 we played a real bad ballgame its not in line with the way weve played lately weve been very competitive
2886980 i just go for it with the feeling that i am going to have fun doing the activities

2887097 in the last few years there are more and more reasons to be concerned in our country about the institutional situation of the castilian language
2887098 the spain which exists as we know it for hundreds and hundreds of years is one which speaks in one language and in several
2887099 bilingualism is not respected in several regions and this creates problems for national tourists who only speak castilian and for foreigners
2887100 its a fundamental right to receive an education in the language of your country and it is being ridiculed
2887101 it is not meant to marginalise castilian but to support the weaker language

2887123 there is no reason why home births should not be offered to women at low risk of complications and it may confer considerable benefits to them and their families
2887124 evidence to support the assertion that homebirths is a less safer option for women experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies
2887125 he pretty much defines the term undersized power forward but hes never backed down from any match up the celtics drafted the more recognizable glen davis but powe hasnt given up his spot in the rotation much like kevin garnett he never takes a play off and he plays tough team defense powe even scored more points per game 7 9 than james posey and tony allen
2887126 if you want a nice guy to go about his business like a mild mannered man you can look past jason maxiell if hes in the game for a minute or a quarter hes making an impact gobbling up rebounds throwing down massive dunks and blocking shots that send players to their knees all with his 6 5 frame how can you not vote for the man who eats babies on a regular basis and makes no apologies for it
2887127 najeras tough and tenacious and he rebounds very well for his size i expect him to be one of the better players on the sadly lacking nets this season
2887128 reggie evans gained mainstream attention when he grabbed chris kamans family jewels while playing for the denver nuggets in the 2006 07 season now thats doing the dirty work evans is a guy who makes a living on hustle he has very little actual basketball talent but is always among the leaders in rebounds per minute at times he was the best player on the floor in the sixers pistons playoff series this year shocking but true when hes on his game hes a menace
2887129 a brief d leaguer who wasnt thought to amount to much of anything has become a pivotal part of the mavs future hes undersized but plays in the paint not incredibly athletic but outworks other guys and plays with a huge chip on his shoulder as dallas moves forward in trying to eliminate their finesse team moniker bass is going to be a huge part of that
2887130 few players would be able to parlay a season in which they scored just 6 6 points per game and pulled down 3 9 rebounds a night into a new four year 17 million contract then again few players alive play with the energy heart and determination turiaf does the free spirited reserve rebounds defends and blocks shots but it is his relentless passion for the game that sees him outclass all other hustle players
2887131 the guy is a gnat on defense the kind of in your face guy that pisses off opposing players and fans can get in players heads and cause an off night hes a skinny euro but he has developed a fearless game fearless of shooting as well whether hes hot or not the fact that detroit and san antonios coaching staff spoke highly of him says a lot
2887132 the man is a physical freak with a wingspan longer than youd expect explosive speed and the intelligence to read opposing players and anticipate their moves ju ju has quickly become one of the hornets best defenders while simultaneously snagging steals left and right when hes not hopping around for boards he may not have dominated the stat sheet like other rookies last year but he did a little of everything and was a total hustle player
2887133 this has bruce bowens name all over it but if i chose him most people would likely see his name and skip right past it so instead ill take bowens soon to be predecessor and pupil ime udoka
2887134 im not going to have to worry about him obama because somebody else down south is going to take him out if that man is elected president hell be shot sure as hell the hate would be so deep down south
2887135 the kkk or someone will assassinate obama if we get a n president all you n s sic will think youve won and that the white people will have to bow to you f that
2887136 the scary thing out there is the lone wolf phenomenon there are enough crazy people in this movement that it is possible one of them will decide today is the day to kick off the aryan revolution
2887137 im here for my country first and foremost but also for everyone whos ever had to deal with this around the world
2887138 people kind of look at me as an inspiration but the people who send me those messages and stories theyre my inspiration especially since a lot of them are in far worse situations than im in right now
2887139 thats kind of been weighing on me the most since ive been here just the fact that i still have this in my body and there is still some risk to it the doctors have told me ill be fine ill be cured of it but i just want to hurry up and be done with it already
2887140 it does take away a little bit from this experience
2887141 ive just tried to minimize it as much as i can i dont want to think about it and i dont want to dwell on it but sometimes thats hard because its such a big deal
2887142 the first few days you feel bad for him then its almost like you forget he has it
2887143 hes part of the team i cant believe what hes going through but he still has that drive to be here and do his best
2887144 but his goal was to swim at the olympic games and hes excited were all supporting each other in everything we do
2887145 we were trying to figure out why he was being so coy and turning up to training late
2887146 there were many rumors floating around we started most of them
2887147 the olympics look a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer
2887148 it gives us an idea that what were doing here isnt as high on the pedestal as we sometimes put it on were going to be behind him every step of the way it doesnt end here
2887149 im really happy i did that it was one of the best experiences for a sporting event ive ever been to in my life
2887150 the coaches were worried about us being on our feet being hot but i dont care that was something i always wanted to do if i ever made the team

2887161 what astonished me the most about iran were its women i met and spoke with scores of them from all parts of the country and everywhere they were wonderful vivid bold articulate in several languages politically astute and audaciously outward looking while some men demurred the women werent afraid to voice opinions about anything under the sun

2887166 it has on each side two figures of women very well made in such a building he dispatches his work with those men who bear office in his kingdom and govern his cities and his favorites talk with him them after the king has talked with these men on subjects pleasing to him he bids enter the lord and captains who wait at the gate and these at once enter to make their salaam to him the salaam which is the greatest courtesy that exists among them is that they put their hands joined together above their head as high as they can every day they go to make the salaam to the king

2887199 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2887200 i thought it was important for me to get out there tonight and compete against a team we know is going to be very successful
2887201 i thought it was a good start i still have a long way to go and im glad that one is under my belt
2887202 thats a lot of fun to get in there against some of their starters and get some work
2887203 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics

2887212 there have been national enquirer headlines claiming a love child scandal involved senator john edwards or a member of his staff forcing edwards to issue a strong public denial
2887213 despite its reputation as a supermarket tabloid the national enquirer is the paper that broke the story which was confirmed of jesse jackson having an illegitimate child hence the papers exclusives cannot be dismissed out of hand
2887214 edwards contacted abc news and requested that he be interviewed about the allegations

2887239 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2887240 the temperature has decreased i must rectify the situation for my own comfort
2887241 in a few words explain what this blog is about
2887242 do those girls on the perimeter need to keep prancing like that for the next hour
2887243 ruth continued from early morning without resting even for a moment
2887244 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2887245 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything
2887246 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research

2887256 weil sich die wurftechnik der koreaner von der der europ er stark unterscheidet
2887257 wir haben 30 minuten gebraucht um ins spiel zu gelangen aber eine handballbegegnung dauert eben die doppelte zeit und in der hat sich die bessere und konstantere mannschaft durchgesetzt
2887258 wir werden in den n chsten tagen noch einiges zeigen
2887259 ditte und heike haben sich von durchgang zu durchgang gesteigert beide ihr volles leistungsverm gen abgerufen und keine nervenschw che gezeigt
2887260 wir k nnen und wollen in allen synchrondisziplinen ganz vorne mit dabei sein nach dem tollen ergebnis sind wir jetzt besonders motiviert und werden hier noch einiges zeigen

2887262 wir haben berall gel chelt unter und ber wasser ditte und ich mussten uns nur anschauen und wussten der f nfte sprung ist ein punktebringer
2887263 vor dem ersten sprung war ich sehr nerv s danach ging es aber immer besser
2887264 ich freue mich unheimlich dass der auerbach diesmal geklappt hat bei der olympia qualifikation hat ditte ihn total vergurkt und h tte deshalb beinahe nicht in peking starten d rfen

2887268 i cant believe it i never thought id have a chance to whip on them youngins
2887269 they all did a good job too theyre all awesome and i was very glad to meet them
2887270 i think they all took it seriously i just think i worked harder i had something to prove that i could do it at my age and with bilateral surgery on my knees
2887271 you know how i said i wanted that piece of pie at sprouts once the challenge was over im not going to reward myself with that until i get under 200 it is within reach maybe a couple of weeks
2887272 for the first time in my life i have it in my head that im going to do it
2887273 now when i drive by this mosque its not just a big building thats foreign
2887274 i can tell you that these rigs have saved not hundreds but probably thousands of lives
2887275 im a little bit embarrassed that the sign is so big
2887276 ill quote him i dont want to do a statue in the park
2887277 that was steel shells on the sides a lockdown for a cot and a lot of bungee cords where stuff was tied to the walls

2887283 we have a lot to make up but we are in the time frame right now where we will be able to tell if the pinks are going to return to prince william sound and southeast alaska
2887284 if this was the end of the season we would be very short across the board but we still have another six weeks ahead with the exception of sockeye and chum salmon salmon harvests have been lower than forecast
2887285 but the jury is still out on the pink salmon harvest
2887286 the pink harvest has started to take off in kodiak but remains flat in southeast and prince william sound
2887287 we are seeing poor runs of multiple species across broad geographic areas
2887288 that indicates to me it is probably an ocean problem but mixed in with those were a few runs that were pretty good
2887289 we have a great record of making escapement goals which is the main thing
2887290 good escapement goals set you up for a good run in the next years
2887291 descidas nos pre os n o s o suficientes falta o governo reduzir o imposto sobre os produtos petrol feros
2887292 blogs are just a publishing technology which can be used for distributing any type of content including journalism some bloggers are journalists but most are not
2887293 http www martinstabe com blog 2007 02 03 blogging vs journalism yet again
2887294 sydneys probably comparable to melbourne and perth in that sense in terms of the level of exposure however just being larger
2887295 any further deterioration in the outlook for global growth would represent a significant downside risk to the domestic activity profile particularly if it led to a marked slowing in growth in china and india
2887296 in addition the ongoing turmoil in capital markets could exacerbate the slowing in domestic growth by further reducing the availability of credit to households and businesses
2887297 the budgets especially for traditional advertising keep shrinking and clients want more for the buck they pay in addition the cost of talent is rising to the point of an unreasonable level
2887298 lack of understanding a friend of mine who was a traditional art director said that he thought interactive was cheap and quick in reality its expensive and time consuming many people lack a decent understanding of what it takes to do interactive work
2887299 there are really two main concerns cost and quality when it comes to cost and interactive production there really are two extremes at play one extreme is that you have interactive productions that require the same high end special effects and quality that television requires there still is a huge misconception that because the production is going to be on the web it is going to be cheaper in fact the cost will most likely increase because in addition you now need to make that content interactive on the other extreme you have concepts that require a streamlined cost effective method of production that means having people on the team who wear more than one hat the new term preditor producer shooter editor describes this new emerging group of filmmakers
2887300 in general ive noticed a healthy influx of interactive capabilities one stop shop content makers and other longer form talent like episodic television directors now being represented though commercial production companies then there are support services like digital and graphic design in house editorial ancillary production work on a wish level id like to see more a directorial talent take a greater part in online projects even if its not profitable now
2887301 yes of course as the definition of interactive marketing gets bigger there will be a lot more specialists there are already some excellent interactive production companies that only do installations or mobile or 3 d or games and there are some giant ones doing massive productions of banners i think it will fragment and actually make it much easier for agencies to go back to being brand agents and there will be a wealth of specialists to make it easier to get good work done
2887302 it would be great to explore how we facilitate collaboration right now we are still very much in the hands off mind set i would love combined teams in one space where we generate and evolve on the job we might even learn something along the way can you imagine the fresh ideas that could come from that level of interaction
2887303 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2887304 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2887305 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2887306 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2887307 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2887308 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2887309 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2887310 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2887311 now they have this great platform they can cross fertilize with content and redistribute
2887312 the necessary flexibility to do something strategic with either of these businesses today
2887313 history has a way of changing things around in peoples minds
2887314 what people today dont remember or realize but i remember very clearly is how excited everybody was when this first happened your brethren in the press thought this was a very bold move aol was not the third fourth place or whatever it is today it was the leader
2887315 i smelled it a little bit but i didnt smell it enough to try to block it
2887316 if you own an suv and you know the long term prospects for an suv are not positive because the price of gas is going up what do you do
2887317 you figure out a way to make money put in a hybrid motor or electric motor or if youre a forward thinking company you sell it while it still has value but what you dont do is drive it in the mud and wait
2887318 the net net of this today is its a much less powerful much less dynamic much less elastic and growing organization
2887319 time warner management has acknowledged many times the negative impact of the aol deal after the internet bubble burst
2887320 we moved on after 2001 and undertook what was widely acknowledged as a difficult turnaround over a period of years
2887321 were continuing our transformation toward an even more content focused company with strong brands and improving prospects for growth
2887322 jeff has the view his core business is content and production
2887323 if were right time warner is getting close to an outright sale of aol
2887324 and if the division fetches the value we suspect of about 12 billion then we think theres about 2 50 of near term upside in time warner
2887325 so where in the game rules does it say that companies have to be responsible for anything other than profits
2887326 how do the networks reach the consumers when they are on the move
2887327 with the clout of an nbc or an abc clients are going to do that first
2887328 will not move the dial as the network revenue ad base is in the billions at most this could be 2 to 4 of their base business
2887329 with the stroke of a pen the u s court of appeals has opened the door to a massive increase in the penetration of dvr capabilities
2887330 in short order effective dvr penetration could now jump to north of 60 of cable households that is all digital cable subscribers with an even larger increase in dvr outlets per home
2887331 if youre buying a car your first experience with the brand is after an internet search
2887332 consumers look at a website and that interface becomes part of the understanding of that brand
2887333 the motion and the clean graphics show the wit and playfulness of the brand
2887334 even if youve never been to a store you feel like you would recognize it
2887335 its not the highest resolution but a way to show data its a fun thing to see where you are in relation to your friends
2887336 its a lot easier for us than for traditional firms to change their culture and do what we do
2887337 small new firms say we understand the new digital space
2887338 if you are big and old by definition you dont thats how they are branding them vs us
2887339 at a gathering of branding firms if you ask who is an expert everyones hand goes up including the catering company its very confusing for clients in the end the client has to decide what mix of partners they need
2887340 memory seems to be made up mostly of still pictures
2887341 historically her footprint was primarily on the west coast but i would say in the last five years she has expanded her footprint to a national level and in the last two years has really put a lot of distance between herself and competitors
2887342 i would estimate that 60 to 70 of all big pitches are going to her
2887343 she seems to have grabbed the market from boston based pile amp co in my mind they are less active or at least publicly active
2887344 you have some old school consultants who are really good people but they dont present themselves well when they go head to head
2887345 catherine is a pretty sharp lady she presents herself well shes got an agency background and has hired a couple people who do too so they do very well
2887346 rigor of their process and ability to implement an agency selection process that was comprehensive effective and efficient
2887347 its not a required part of our process we take a very firm position that we will not solicit or sign up agencies at the start of a review
2887348 the business model for newspapers is broken no one has figured out how to fix it thats probably because it cant be fixed
2887349 yet there was john edwards ignoring the many many previous examples of why it is so important to admit the truth quickly and keep it simple unable to deny any longer that he had had an affair with a campaign worker he insisted on parsing it was all a mistake if she was paid off it wasnt my money and in what may be a new high in the annals of weaseldom my wifes cancer was in remission

2887382 keine frage vor nicht allzu langer zeit war die mahnung man solle nicht jede weltgeschichtliche grausamkeit als holocaust und nicht jedes zweite regime als faschistisch etikettieren ein triftiger ber das relativierungss chtige bed rfnis das in aller regel als movens hinter solchen verlautbarungen stand aufgekl rter einwand einstweilen jedoch ist die warnung vor einer solch interessierten inflationierung ihrerseits zur ubiquit ren und nicht weniger interessierten floskel geworden die tats chliche bedrohungen unter der toga moralischer entr stung verh llt
2887383 denn in zeiten globalisierter regression ist politik als versuch schlimmerem einhalt zu gebieten gerade die konsequenz einer auf ihre bedingungen reflektierenden an der freiheit der individuen orientierten gesellschaftskritik bla bla bef rdert die gruppe sinistra pc dorthin zur ck wo sie angefangen hat in des volkes scho denn dort ist das ozeanische unbehagen an der zivilisation zu hause bla bla um es nochmals zu betonen die bedingung der m glichkeit jener bestimmten negation erfordert die verteidigung des im bestehenden immerhin als verhei ung pr senten zivilisatorischen berschusses gegen die r ckkunft des vorzivilisatorischen schreckens in der kurrenten gestalt ihrer ummasozialistischen protagonisten sowie ihrer deutsch europ ischen verwandten im ungeiste
2887384 die wahlverwandschaft von konservatismus und revolution wird den sinistren dialektikern also bis auf weiteres verschlossen bleiben und man wird sich deshalb auch nicht zur intervention im realpolitischen handgemenge gedr ngt f hlen sondern an stelle von kritik selbstverliebtem theoriegepauke fr nen
2887385 im grunde ist mit dieser paraphrase liebknechts alles gesagt dass das anti deutsche bem hen nie etwas anderes war als ordin rer antiimperialismus der aufgrund anderer politischer umst nde eine zeit lang eher zuf llig auf das richtige objekt zielte und sich nunmehr gegen den imperialismus gegen den krieg f r den frieden im umma sozialistischen geist
2887386 nicht von ungef hr wird daher auch kaum noch der versuch unternommen den kritischen begriff den man sich in antideutschen kreisen von islamischen gemeinschaften und der dazugeh rigen ideologie immerhin zu machen versucht als der sache wom glich unangemessen zu revidieren oder gar zu entkr ften
2887387 hinweis auf den relativ geringen industrialisierungsgrad islamisch gepr gter weltregionen der jedoch geht aus mindestens zwei gr nden an der sache vorbei erstens weil es gerade die historische versp tung bzw r ckst ndigkeit war welche die deutschen f r ihren antikapitalismus zu nutzen wussten zweitens weil das argument mangelnder industrialisierung sich durch die fortschritte des iranischen atomprogramms selbst berholt hat
2887388 keine frage vor nicht allzu langer zeit war die mahnung man solle nicht jede weltgeschichtliche grausamkeit als holocaust und nicht jedes zweite regime als faschistisch etikettieren ein triftiger ber das relativierungss chtige bed rfnis das in aller regel als movens hinter solchen verlautbarungen stand aufgekl rter einwand einstweilen jedoch ist die warnung vor einer solch interessierten inflationierung selbst zur ubiquit ren und nicht weniger interessierten floskel geworden die tats chliche bedrohungen unter der toga moralischer entr stung verh llt entsprechend versteht man sich hierzulande mittlerweile bestens darauf sich des schlechten gewissens nicht mehr alleine durch verdr ngung und projektion sondern getreu dem motto erinnerung macht frei gerade durchs bekenntnis zur eigenen geschichte zu entledigen und ganz nebenbei unmoral in moralische berlegenheit umzum nzen
2887389 als ob die parteinahme f r die usa und f r israel auf politikberatung und nicht darauf zielte den antiamerikanischen und antizionistischen konsens deutscher friedensfreunde wo es nur geht zu st ren und die kollaboration mit regimes wie dem iran auf allen ebenen zu delegitimieren man darf darauf gespannt sein wie sinistra solch in der tat unselige gesch ftemacherei wie sie insbesondere deutsche firmen aber auch erst k rzlich die sterreichische omv betrieben und weiterhin betreiben zu sabotieren gedenkt ohne dabei in geostrategische verlegenheiten zu geraten
2887390 en passant wird hier aus welchen gr nden auch immer eine dauerhafte milit rische berlegenheit israels unterstellt die es so nat rlich nicht gibt weil diese berlegenheit eine frage politischer k mpfe ist und nicht auf unbezwingbaren m chten basiert

2887447 no me voy con el mejor sabor de boca pero s que quiz s cualquier otro resultado hubiera sido injusto hoy creo que mejoramos en no cometer errores y estar en el mismo canal quiz s nos falt un poco ofensivamente pero cuando vuelvan varios jugadores que tenemos fuera vamos a estar mejor
2887448 s fue curioso me hablaba y me dec a qu defensor que soy la verdad que bien creo que es un jugador que representa mucho para puebla y que haga esas cosas motiva mucho a sus compa eros
2887449 el rbitro fue un tanto imparcial y cort el juego pero hay que lidiar con esto en el futbol mexicano ya que son dos o tres los que son buenos y los dem s son de medio pelo y la verdad es que nos desesper a los dos lados
2887450 fue un partido muy trabado lo manejamos bien y estuvimos bien parados pero s nos vamos con cierto sabor a derrota porque pudimos haber conseguido m s la temporada pasada met amos las que ten amos y ahora no hemos podido
2887451 nos est costando pero hemos hecho buenos partidos ya hemos tenido una que otra oportunidad que pudieron haber cambiado nuestros resultados pero estamos tranquilos porque estamos haciendo las cosas bien y ante indios esperamos sacar la victoria
2887452 ha habido algunos imponderables tenemos cinco jugadores en selecci n nacional ludue a no est ben tez no est y aun as estamos soportando el mismo nivel de juego que el torneo anterior s lo nos esta faltando hacer goles
2887453 yo no juzgo un resultado sino una manera de jugar que es la que nos ha dado muchas cosas siempre buscar ganar
2887454 estoy contento por lo que manifest el equipo porque lo que expres en la charla t cnica fue lo que se manifest en la cancha un equipo ordenado un equipo que respeto una filosof a de juego y tarde o temprano tiene que llegar el triunfo este equipo ha vivido que hasta en 8 partidos llevemos 2 puntos por eso lo que m s resalto es la forma en la que estamos trabajando y eso me motiva
2887455 me gust todo este d a siempre los partidos aqu con puebla son muy interesantes despiertan mucha pasi n y lo que mas resalto es el detalle que tuvieron los jugadores de puebla que me dieron un regalo y un reconocimiento
2887456 ustedes vieron creo que el arbitraje fue muy rigorista porque una de las filosof as de mi equipo es no hacer foules y la expulsi n de
2887457 en las cascaritas chel s me dice que juegue de central
2887458 fue un partido complicado con muchas imprecisiones no tuvimos muchas chances de gol y estuvimos imprecisos en el medio campo al final por la situaci n de vilchez que no pod a aguantar el dolor chel s me mand a la defensa y por suerte lo pude hacer bien porque en las cascaritas ah me pide que juegue
2887459 todo lo que marc fue muy dudoso se pas mucho con las tarjetas no nos dejo jugar tanto lo nico bueno fue que no influy en el resultado
2887460 lo bueno es que no hemos perdido pero en el partido de hoy no creamos muchas chances de gol y as es dif cil ganar nos motiva el hecho de que indios est mal y nosotros con el paso de las jornadas vamos a mejorar
2887461 dadas las circunstancias no es malo el punto obviamente queremos sumar de a tres pero como se dio el partido ante un gran rival es importante
2887462 yo con l me sent a muy bien respaldado pero as es el futbol situaciones que tienes que resolver en un segundo en las que uno suele ser muy atrevido y como ya estaba amonestado tuvo que irse
2887463 necesito un poco mas de compa a de repente me encuentro un poco solo pero de apoco iremos encontrado ese equilibrio
2887464 el rbitro condicion el partido en la expulsi n de ismael rodr guez fue muy apresurado e incluso lo vi muy nervioso me parece que la importancia del partido y la rivalidad que existe entre ambos equipos provoc que se equivocar en un par de ocasiones porque tambi n no juzg un fuerte golpe sobre enrique vera y no expuls a ninguno de ellos as como otra jugada en la que un lateral de morelia toc con la mano el bal n y ya estaba amonestado
2887465 estos errores no quiere decir que hay justificaci n por no asegurar el triunfo pero creo que este tipo de situaciones condicionan al juego y a un buen espect culo as que le pedimos que no vuelvan a suceder esos errores
2887466 sabiamos que en las jugadas a pelota parada se iban a tener esos peque os roces pero en todos los partidos que he visto aqui en m xico no han marcado un penalti en contra de esa manera s lo queremos que nos ganen con un buen futbol y nos con esos condicionamientos
2887467 en el primer tiempo jugamos muy mal no me gust me parece que fueron los peores cuarenta y cinco minutos que hemos tenido a lo largo del torneo en el segundo tiempo fuimos m s agresivos y contundentes que como recompensa pudimos hacer un lindo gol
2887468 me duele mucho esta expulsi n porque ped a gritos jugar y ahora que tuve la oportunidad el rbitro fue muy rigorista pues desde el primer tiempo se la pas encima de carlos s nchez y de m nos dec a que no le reclamaramos nada porque nos hechar a o marcar a un penalti en contra
2887469 cuando estabamos dentr del rea hubo un forcejeo en el que romero se deja caer sujetandome de playera que como consecuencia ca encima de l y de inmediato el rbitro me sac la tarjeta amarilla en ese momento le dije que por qu no aguantaba la presi n tras los reclamos del morelia y con esto tuvo para sacarme la tarjeta roja
2887470 me llamo mucho la atenci n porque el rbitro buscaba tanta conversaci n con nosotros y los reclamos del morelia los dejo pasar s lo espero que la comisi n de arbitraje tome medidas y ponga atenci n a este tipo de errores que no pueden seguir pasando

2887473 dubai is known for innovation and taking radical steps which its neighbouring emirates and countries cant even dream of
2887474 i think by the time supply comes on board dubai would have created more demand
2887475 independientemente de que no pudimos conseguir el triunfo me voy contento por el buen funcionamiento y entrega total que mostr el equipo frente a grandes jugadores que tiene el am rica aunque debo reconocer que este punto obtenido nos preocupa porque durante el torneo llevamos tres empates que no nos ayudan de mucho para estar en una mejor posicion en nuestro grupo que es el m s complicado
2887476 desde un principio del partido ambos equipos apostaron todo para ganar y se reflejo con un juego de toma y daca despu s en el segundo tiempo el rival tuvo mayor control del bal n pero supimos reponernos y hasta tuvimos la oportunidad de remontar el marcador en una jugada que tuvimos en los ultimos minutos pero el gran trabajo de ochoa nos impidi llevarnos la victoria
2887477 este es el puebla para esto hay para esto nos alcanza pero nosotros nos seguimos matando hoy no merec amos ganar contra el mejor equipo de la liga pero tampoco perder porque aunque los imponderables estuvieron en nuestra contra siempre estuvimos luchando pelando y hasta hoy nadie ha pasado por encima de nosotros
2887478 obviamente con esto no nos alcanza tenemos que sumar de a tres pero por el momento para lo que estamos empezando construir por lo que tenemos que sudar lo tenemos que padecer puedo decirles que este es un puebla del que me siento orgulloso
2887479 no tenemos el carrilero izquierdo que los dos ltimos a os hemos tenido mora y entonces tenemos que trabajar de otra manera en cada partido nos hemos plantado de tres maneras diferentes y en las tres hemos arriesgado y sin haber sido ganadores en esta reorganizaci n vamos bien los que le van al puebla no se angustien y los que no agu ntense
2887480 mi defensa en tres partidos s lo ha recibido dos goles por eso no me preocupa en lo m s m nimo
2887481 prefiero que mis jugadores se pasen de energ a a que les falte la penitencia la pr xima semana se la va a echar lvaro ortiz no yo el equipo se sobrepuso a su ausencia y me ense o que puede jugar con 10 y con 9 hombres el expulsado pierde el lugar y l stima porque se lo ven a ganando bien pero es tanta las ganas de todos de demostrar que pasa esto llevamos 22 jugadores en 3 partidos y ah est n todos al pie del ca n y con su caracter stica m s tatuada que nunca

2887497 for a long period in the season he came under heavy criticism from a section of the hostile perak crowd its a credit to his professionalism that he ignored the vindictive and often personal abuse and got on with his job of scoring goals he was very close to returning to chile at one point due to the aggressive abuse he and his family received but the perak players rallied around him as they realised his abilty to score goals was second to none and he was an excellent character as part of the team
2887498 he is an exciting player i feel he is still not there physically but overall he has all the skill and technical qualities to be an arsenal player
2887499 i cant believe jim mcginty and alan carpenter plan to close this hospital down as a tertiary hospital

2887515 due to the many caution periods it was a very difficult race for a time it appeared as if it would be very difficult for us to win however with a really good performance and thanks to audi tdi power we were able to achieve the result we wanted i m happy for the team that we brought home this double victory and it was also a very nice audi d but for marcel f ssler
2887516 the strategy that we had in our minds before the race did not work out because of the many yellows nevertheless i was able to pull away quite well unfortunately we always lost the advantage we had due to the caution periods thank god in the end it was still enough to win i m more than happy marcel f ssler must also be praised it was his first race with this car and he was able to catch the two acura hondas and thus make the audi 1 2 victory perfect this was again a great race weekend thanks to the team of audi sport north america to the boys at home and michelin
2887517 a beautiful 50th race the race was not easy especially after the penultimate restart with the two acura hondas in front of me behind these cars we lost a lot of down force so it was incredibly difficult to close the gap to them once i even went off the track at the end it worked well thanks to audi tdi power we got the acura hondas on the straights it was a nice race i spent a lot of time in the car it was a lot of fun
2887518 this was a very special race for me the final restart was unbelievable it was pretty close between brabham and the wall but i said to myself now or never it worked out i am very happy that i was able to give the second place to the team it ran very well from the beginning i am satisfied generally speaking the atmosphere at audi and in the american le mans series is perfect
2887519 i m really happy it was a very good and interesting race with many yellows some helped us some did not help us i think we did a good job marcel f ssler drove very well and integrated really well into the team there is nothing to complain about and we can go home with a smile on our faces
2887520 this was a perfect day with excellent driving from all our drivers the team did not make any mistakes our strategy and pit stops were also good and both marco and marcel made great passes at the end of the race
2887521 that will expand but its hard to do here because we dont have a system of royalty rates
2887522 the problem is when you sit down with them all of a sudden their great desire to pay the artists seems to evaporate
2887523 we dont like the result of services we asked you to set up
2887524 the riaa has taken its lumps but is not getting its kudos
2887525 its harder and easier to be a musician these days
2887526 role in this is worthy of a multi hour discussion
2887527 we have to make sure isps have an incentive to innovate
2887528 be careful before you legislate away their incentive for business development
2887529 the keyword is survival we are married to technology and technology does drive a lot of the decisions
2887530 i went out and bought myself a drum machine and added drum programmer to my business card
2887531 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
2887532 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2887533 but this research indicates that this may not be as big of an issue as marketers think clearly the bigger challenge is focusing the community around a purpose that people want to contribute to and be involved with
2887534 one interesting discovery was the apparent inconsistency between what organizations set as goals and what they actually measure
2887535 we also noticed mismatches between what respondents set as goals and the investments they actually make as well as between their goals and the talent that they deploy against the community initiatives
2887536 these findings mirror what we have seen in our earlier studies of organizations using social media channels in their communications initiatives
2887537 this may be indicative of the maturity level of the communications industry in terms of their understanding of how to best deploy and measure new communications tools and methodologies
2887538 invest most in the area that services your key business objective
2887539 make sure you deliver real special unique obvious value to the core group you
2887540 the core of the community needs to be of high value or interest to people a focus worth contributing to
2887541 get insight into what motivates members to join the community we found a different motivation than we hypothesized too often people get drunk with web 2 0 tool excitement and then try to push their business and customer goals into the wrong tool
2887542 people are busy they need information in brief easy to scan bits they can quickly choose what is interesting to them and go right to it
2887543 keep activity levels up constantly add new content what can you do to excite people and get them to share in the community
2887544 make sure you devote enough time to managing the community letting it fester is worse than not having it in the first place
2887545 participate but do not try to control the community belongs to the people not you
2887546 get legal and pr to buy in and help on design but keep them out of active management
2887547 make sure you have a committed core of passionate users before you launch
2887548 you must have a critical number of high quality participants to get the momentum going
2887549 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
2887550 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
2887551 due to the stopping of supplies for past many days there is crisis like situation in the valley fruits worth crores of rupees cant be shipped to jammu and other parts
2887552 valley is a potential market for goods manufactured in or imported from jammu besides most of the forwarding agents for kashmir fruits are based in jammu in the whole process jammu will suffer most economically it would be wiped off the trade map the state will lose over rs 800 crores annually by virtue of excise duty and other taxes
2887553 as people of jammu have decided to continue the economic blockade the government must open alternative trade routes to tackle the grave situation in the valley india and pakistan must immediately open the cross loc routes with valley
2887554 it is surprising how the government is tolerating the economic blockade to kashmir the blockade is totally unconstitutional illegal and government must immediately act against the vested interests and restore supplies to the valley
2887555 the authorities should also explore alternative road links to the valley
2887556 many of our bookings have been cancelled as the activists of extremists organizations are not allowing the tourists to travel to kashmir we desperately need to explore the options of alternative route links like jehlum valley road in the wake of the blockade
2887557 the opening of routes like srinagar muzaffarabad will not only give kashmiri products an access to the international markets like central and east asia but other world class products could also be made available to the consumers here
2887558 the cross loc trade will give fillip to the valleys economy
2887559 people have been left starving here in the absence of essential commodities the muzaffarabad road needs to be opened so that essential food items life saving drugs and other items of daily use reach the valley
2887560 among all valleyites we are the worst hit by the highway blockade this is our peak season and unfortunately all our produce is rotting in trucks on the highway though india and pakistan have been working on the cbms but now is the time when the jehlum valley road needs to be opened so that we are saved from incurring huge losses
2887561 if the government doesnt immediately open the cross loc roads we will be forced to go on hunger strike
2887562 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
2887563 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness
2887564 executives realize that if employees are stressed out financially have excess debt it really makes them less productive
2887565 theres a real financial benefit to the company a long term financial benefit for their employees to be on track for retirement and financially fit
2887566 if a company doesnt have a competitive 401 k program in place its going to be very difficult to compete for talent
2887567 ajaran agama itu selalu berputar seperti siang dan malam begitu pula dengan ajaran pak musaddeq para rasul itu selalu ada zamannya dan bergiliran membawa ajaran agama

2887569 why is kyle baker including these gross and weird looking children in this comic

2887598 we sent the accountant a fax saying we needed an investment income of 50 000 so then the accountant put on his letterhead that my client has an investment income of 50 000 and was able to support the mortgage
2887599 they certify it that this is the amount she had and she can support the mortgage
2887600 on the original application they always used to disclose as british even though they were not british they were from uganda from nigeria and they told me to mention on every single application that the client was british

2887602 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
2887603 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
2887604 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
2887605 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2887606 you told me more about the process than i know
2887607 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
2887608 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
2887609 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
2887610 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
2887611 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
2887612 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
2887613 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2887614 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals

2887624 you arent going to believe this but the ups guy just delivered the media guide and as we said all of our thank yous and have a nice days i turned to mrs
2887625 you turn a photographer or a bird watcher or an audubon guy loose here and theyre just going to go nuts for hours and hours
2887626 we expect to finish the project on or ahead of schedule
2887627 we find that agreement very encouraging and thats the kind of flexibility that we hope the department of homeland security can bring to this unique situation as well
2887628 the state of texas has been a longstanding partner in border law enforcement through the texas parks and wildlife game wardens
2887629 similarly weve been longstanding partners with both the federal government and citizens of the rio grande valley to invest in the conservation of these unique and irreplaceable resources
2887630 the economy is affecting everyone even people who arent low income have to make adjustments
2887631 but low income families are more vulnerable to changes in the economy some people eat at home instead of going out to dinner but others go to the food bank
2887632 basic things like bread and milk are rising and people cant do without them so they turn to the food bank and food stamps
2887633 in the news media when there was a debate of whether there was a recession i had no question we saw it here all the time
2887634 people are underemployed they cannot afford the cost of food and their increased expenses
2887635 even in a strong economy low income texans struggle to make ends meet
2887636 today the combination of rising food and energy prices is making it even harder for low wage workers to feed their families
2887637 even though we are not dealing with a natural disaster we are dealing with a disaster nonetheless
2887638 but weve got to do this im sitting here thinking of everything i need to do i need to get another job everything piles up bills dont wait
2887639 s a food bank sees a spike in users but not in donations
2887640 broken down the sense of isolation and aberration offenders have
2887641 discovering that when they go online there are lots of people like them with whom they can network around the world
2887642 we cant even begin to put a dent in the problem
2887643 theres nothing from this investigation thats been turned up nor otherwise are federal and state authorities aware of any ongoing efforts to recruit young girls or boys here in vermont to have sex with adults
2887644 its a shame that this is a country that has historically required tragedy in order to really wake up and understand the true dimensions of a problem
2887645 once photos or videos are taken the children are not likely to tell anyone because they know the images will be out there forever
2887646 we have seen some kids grow up on the internet
2887647 they collect photographs of kids like some collect baseball cards
2887648 a lot of people doing this just look at images but theres a certain percentage that will start to victimize children in their own families
2887649 she probably took it the wrong way and busted out the mace

2887652 anything we can do to help educate the public we want to do
2887653 a type of islam a preparation for the true islam or orthodox islam
2887654 it is to help us learn about god to become more obedient to our creator
2887655 todd hunters anti tax claim is an example of a politician at his worst hoping voters will share his selective amnesia
2887656 the changes have begun and i think im going to be part of that
2887657 she had a great desire to use her talents as a producer and as a very spiritual person to celebrate social justice and to unveil social injustice
2887658 as a mom as my wife and as my friend she didnt need to thank me for visiting her but she always did
2887659 a couple weeks later i said to myself what are you doing with your life
2887660 his death opened my eyes to realizing there are things i need to accomplish in this world
2887661 this is what happens when you let the canadians have technology more advanced than wood burning stoves and beaver traps
2887662 the eclipse ensemble is pleased to continue the celebration of the remarkable writers we have featured since 1997
2887663 you can put your heart and soul into something and readers go because the writer has missed some portion of the cliches out there

2887665 gave me the inspiration that my kind of sf might be welcome
2887666 they have to negotiate discuss and really listen to each other they apply what they have heard or read elsewhere they make stuff up they bounce ideas off each other they have a professor and a college aged teaching assistant in there with them but ultimately they the students are doing the heavy lifting
2887667 that the more speculative fiction i assigned the more students read in general greg keyes once said to me that if you give kids the fruit of the tree of literature they will discover the root if you give them just the root it will kill the tree or at least kill their desire to read any more a lot of parents and teachers it seems to me are worried that their kids dont read much and they figure that if a kid is only going to read a few books a year those books ought to be classics this makes a certain amount of sense but it often backfires sometimes it turns kids off to reading in general the trick is being willing to trust young readers to find the classics but also let them explore and get passionate about whats relevant to their lives no one likes to be forced to do anything

2887677 beijings environmental problems especially air pollution are regional they are determined by wind direction and weather conditions in the region
2887678 i am not taking anything from beyond the 4 gospels as reliable because i do not trust anyone beyond the apostles to have understood a lick of christs teachings
2887679 jesus is one path to god because jesus is one messenger of god among many including abraham and the other prophets and whoever else i forget my pantheism jesus isnt literally the only path to god but his teachings the golden rule centrally advocated by like every prophet in every religion everywhere are the only way to godliness
2887680 enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and many are those who enter by it for the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life and few are those who find it

2887689 its just been a really tough year for me obviously losing the 200 breaststroke at trials kind of affects your confidence a little bit i felt good going into the race tonight but obviously everybody brought their a game eveyrbody swam really really well those times are the top times in the world this year
2887690 i regret to inform you that your husband name rank social security number is dead
2887691 i have had to put my personal opinions aside in order to truly understand that defenders of our freedom are fighting a bigger battle
2887692 their battle goes beyond politics religion race or gender they are the defenders of us all they are the defenders of our differences
2887693 to look beside each soldier to find the people who fight beside them the spouses the sons the daughters we serve too we share the victories we share the defeats together we all fight for our freedom
2887694 whoa whoooooa what time is it is this morning geeeez
2887695 the thing that got people talking shockingly was baby borrowers its airing couldnt have been more topical given the news about jamie lynn spears and the teenage girls who made the pregnancy pact in massachusetts probably the people who need to pay some attention to it who really need to benefit from knowing that raising a kid is no picnic arent going to be the ones who watch it which is sad
2887696 we are thrilled to be adding these awesome artists to our family and cannot thank them enough for the spirit time and energy they have already invested in the house
2887697 we are looking forward to growing and working with them on future projects

2887705 we realized we wanted to push bravo beyond the screen that means both the television screen and the computer screen
2887706 we wanted to provide our fans with some sort of deeper connection with the brand so we came up with the idea of these viewing parties
2887707 we realized bravo fans were dying to talk to us
2887708 were going to live and die by understanding who our viewers are and what theyre looking for and this is one way of doing that
2887709 i think their feedback will help us develop bravos overall strategy whether its programming digital initiatives or our e commerce plan
2887710 were thinking of trying some new things would that be of interest to you
2887711 there are a lot of people trying to discover these new video stars from talent agents to competitors

2887734 but i never would want that job of having to pick whats next theyve done very well
2887735 absolutely i just assumed that hbo would be the right environment for it the fact that amc said they wanted to start this kind of business and do this kind of programming was fantastic it was a great place to get it done
2887736 there are two things at work one is the entertainment value the show is very high quality
2887737 the writing is very good the stories are completely surprising
2887738 theres a cultural resonance because there is some question about who we are and what were about and where we came from
2887739 a lot of the shows are about whats embarrassing and that never changes a lot of its about denial about how we juggle our work and our private lives

2887816 i am very proud to have earned the support of the members of csea seiu local 2001 and to be standing with them in our fight to bring real change for the families of our district
2887817 whether its rising gas and food prices the health care crisis or the unstable housing market working class families in our district are truly struggling just to stay afloat their members know that i will fight for working families every day in congress on the issues that matter to them
2887818 we endorse politicians who support the things we believe in good paying jobs decent health care and retirement quality public services and improving the lives of working families
2887819 jim himes has committed to make these issues his priorities as the 4th districts representative in congress
2887820 a political endorsement is a decision we do not take lightly
2887821 our members support candidates who have pledged to be held accountable to us once elected
2887822 i think it reeks of desperation if they have to position themselves as so edgy and so controversial that theyve been called out by us
2887823 what were trying to do is communicate with the audience in a way that they like and can appreciate
2887824 so somebodys got to talk to sarah you going to talk to her
2887825 clearly sarah closed the gap on kenny over the last month and theres no question without roy blunt kit bond and the partys financial resources kenny would have fell way short
2887826 we had a structural disadvantage but you have those in any campaign we were outspent by 500 000 im not whining about it kenny won its just real but fundraising is where it hurts most its an act against the machine if you give to a candidate they dont support
2887827 roy gave him a financial edge but he didnt give him a bounce
2887828 kennys own internal polls had him up in southwest missouri a few months ago and she won southwest missouri
2887829 i am not happy about the attitude of hulshofs campaign in the recent blog
2887830 hulshof will not have my vote and neither will blunt i vote for principle over party
2887831 are they unmitigated 100 benefits no because everybody in politics has detractors
2887832 they ran three weeks of television ads there free and clear with no hulshof influence they spent 260 000 then they went dark for a period tactically we ceded kansas city and i believe if we followed them to kansas city and met them on that battleground we wouldve lost the election
2887833 we had hoped to lose there by 30 or 40 points instead we lost by 50 we lost well beyond our expectations there
2887834 its hard to move them the battle for undecideds was in kansas city springfield and st louis and when 400 000 people turnout its just not enough clearly something was moving but to be honest with 400 000 it was interesting it was within even four
2887835 his net name i d among republicans statewide was 26 percent when this thing started that means 74 percent of republicans had never heard of kenny hulshof and i bet 100 of her voters voted for sarah steelman for state treasurer before and a large percentage probably voted for her twice once for senator once for treasurer this was kenny hulshofs first statewide election victory so im just gratified we won
2887836 the party held down the better candidate they did everything they could to defeat the better candidate a candidate who they couldnt control and they did defeat her but barely
2887837 ninety five percent of steelman voters will become hulshof voters
2887838 republicans and conservatives without a question are going to vote for kenny hulshof over jay nixon kenny will win southwest missouri and hell win it handily
2887839 without it wed be much less equipped to run a general election now were up and running ready to go
2887840 coach z pretty much called out the plays that were going to be the plays that stand out in the game
2887841 thats two weeks in a row when you get that belief and that excitement its good to see
2887842 there were a couple of plays during the week that i said when i get here im calling this play and its going to be successful when i call it and it sort of happened you know it did it happened
2887843 i want to practice winning for me as a head coach
2887844 its not like im gritting my teeth and im punching guys and grabbing guys and shaking guys or anything like that but its just that i like to win
2887845 how hard can football be once you get the terminology down youre still doing the same thing you can only run a gut stretch dive draw theres five runs you can basically run that everybody in the nfl runs your passing routes youve got slant cross out up go so its the same weve just got to get the terminology down and make it work in the system
2887846 for the most part we are executing mostly what were setting out to do
2887847 my first year the walk got long after the eighth or ninth day after two a days
2887848 you see the guys pass you on the scooter and so i decided to invest in one it just cuts your walk down and your time down getting to practice and the meetings its one of my best investments so far
2887849 he broke tackles i think this year we will be able to see for certain what deangelo williams can do i think the last couple of years we knew he was able to do some things but i think this year will be his true test i think he will do just fine
2887850 one thing that we noticed right away and it started even before we went on summer break was that he was taking a more active approach in the leadership of our team and its very evident now
2887851 i dont mean to make this sound like he was immature but hes really grown up and i think hes become a major player on our offense i mean that in every regard because we can use him on and off the field he helps the young guys as well
2887852 it does feel different being one of the guys that has been here for three years
2887853 you know the laws of the land the lays of the land what you can and cant do its fun because you have new guys coming in and you get to mold them
2887854 you can help them on the field but you can help them off the field as well where to get a house or whatever to make it easier for them on the field because lets face it the easier it is for them off the field the easier it is on the field
2887855 whether im the starter or the backup im preparing myself for both so theres no disappointment there
2887856 but i dont think there will be a starter here you take a starting back and he gets 12 carries and you take the guy thats backing him up and he gets 15 carries truly does it matter who starts as long as there is productivity there
2887857 to be a force to be reckoned with means a lot this year has just been phenomenal its just crazy
2887858 i cant believe we dont win a race in three or four weeks and were in a slump
2887859 i never could get the runs in the right spots
2887860 i needed to stay with him to be close enough to try to make a move in a braking zone we never could get close enough to get an opportunity
2887861 i hope i can give the wood brothers a shot in the arm that they need to really get the momentum to move forward
2887862 weve got so much talent surrounding the quarterback its going to be hard for them to lose a game
2887863 with the coaching staff we have we can make adjustments throughout the game and put our quarterbacks in the best position possible well be fine
2887864 the most consistent performer the guy that makes the play the guy that is least likely to turn it over least likely to make poor decisions
2887865 weve just got to execute the offense just make good decisions and get the ball to our guys because weve got a lot of talent
2887866 we realize all we have to do is just get the ball in playmakers hands and make great decisions and the rest will take care of itself
2887867 it was unfortunate what happened to ryan you know you never want to see a teammate leave
2887868 andrew and i realize its our time to step up
2887869 if youre competing against someone its nice that its a great guy like jarrett lee
2887870 we had the chance to get good experience in the spring i think that will be big
2887871 were working hard weve had this whole camp to work and get comfortable with our teammates and just build off what we started so i think people can estimate us however they want were just going to focus on doing our jobs
2887872 we were able to experiment at glenville because things were so bad that if we got a first down we got a standing ovation
2887873 from there we tweaked and developed it over the years at tulane clemson and west virginia
2887874 the version we run here at michigan likely will be different than what weve done before
2887875 ive played for some of the greatest offensive minds in the game such as mike martz dennis green tom moore and jon gruden and coach rod adapts his system to his personnel as well as anyone
2887876 i could throw the football so we passed a lot woody was a playmaker but coach rod came up with ways to get the ball to wide receiver rod gardner
2887877 ive always told my wife and coaches that if i ever have a big time job im still going to take a small time approach with my office door open to anybody who wants to talk to me
2887878 the best advice i ever got was just be yourself and im going to do that even if im coaching the super bowl champions in the nfl
2887879 at first i didnt like coach rod because he has a very volatile personality on the field and he uses abrasive language
2887880 he does it because he wants to put so much pressure on you to be perfect in practice that youll be prepared for games
2887881 its amazing though how hes completely different off the field he really cares about his players and hes a family guy who loves his wife and children
2887882 if people knew more stuff like that maybe there wouldnt be so many misconceptions about who he is
2887883 were certainly disappointed for requan but we know that hell do everything in his power to return to the field
2887884 well now turn to clifford harris for senior leadership at running back and see who among the younger players will step forward and take advantage of this opportunity
2887885 there certainly were a lot of things talked about and it was all very important to me as long as rutgers and the state of new jersey are committed to being the best were going to grow responsibly i think thats what weve done
2887886 could i have had it if i wanted yes but im part of something bigger than just football im part of rutgers university
2887887 i felt the commitment was there i dont want to do things that way when youre part of something there has to be trust
2887888 i didnt expect this signing here at florida state as a team that i grew up watching grew up loving and always saw in the top five
2887889 theyre counting us out so we have this new mindset that hey we have to step it up and prove the doubters wrong
2887890 i wish they would have had us on the bottom of the list
2887891 we werent really a team and now weve just come together weve gotten everybody to be one its just like its contagious
2887892 i hear it every year were going to be different this year
2887893 on the plane ride over i was kind of thumbing through it looking through it just trying to remember it
2887894 one thing we have to get straight is this chad thing
2887895 were going to have to call him rook or call me c p or something
2887896 i dont know he looks a little thin he needs to eat some chicken wings or something
2887897 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom
2887898 its going to be a lot of fun im looking forward to it i really do
2887899 i dont have revenge on my mind or anything like that i have one thing on my mind and thats a victory period
2887900 i think when youre in this business you know that things can happen anytime
2887901 being in it now this being my second year ive seen things happen throughout the season the last year where hey its just the way this business goes its the nfl and you have to be ready to live with whatever happens it went down
2887902 they said over and over again theyre going to do what they have to do to help this team win
2887903 ive been there before i know what its all about i think it brings out the best in all of us and i think it makes our team better so im no stranger to that i welcome the challenge and i look forward to it
2887904 we might have to back off of the firm and fast a little bit
2887905 its hot its humid its sticky its wet theyre all going to play the same golf course and it isnt going to be like the golf courses weve all seen in the u s open a little bit softer a little bit slower
2887906 it just seems like every time i play in tournaments in this town i play terrible i dont know why i dont feel the pressure but ill feel it a little bit when i step on that first tee
2887907 we are still mowing the same amount of land that we would for the open
2887908 the greens at no 2 are so hard to figure out
2887909 thats what makes this course so much of a challenge
2887910 i think we had five players ranked in the top 10 in 2003 but this field has got a lot of the bigger names in it
2887911 we are very excited and hope we can hold them all here
2887912 i think there is buzz about the tournament and the golf course and i think there are believers out there so thats why our field is so much better
2887913 one of the things he always used to say was when his team got back to school in the fall he would have all of us take off our shoes and socks
2887914 and he would look at our feet and know which of us were playing a lot of golf in the summer and which of us spent more time at the pool

2887931 i said youve got three swings hit the ball out of the ballpark
2887932 but then it comes to the situation when shelby steals the base now what we need at that point is just a base hit but when youve got first and third hes got that hole i wanted him to just be aggressive and attack the ball
2887933 they the errors were routine balls when you make five errors like that you give the other team too many opportunities to score and it comes back to bite you
2887934 after we made the errors then they didnt capitalize to just blow us out like we were saturday night
2887935 we still had a chance and we had the potential game winner right at the plate with two outs
2887936 we cant afford to give away ballgames and its going to come down to this last week where we go head to head with them aug 25 28 at ernie shore

2887938 the community comes out to support this as well as any stop we have on tour and thats important to all of us
2887939 jim correll and his staff get credit because they have one of the best events on our tour you see jay haas and loren roberts and all these guys come here because of the way they run this tournament from the condition of the golf course and what they do for the wives of the players and what they do for charity its a top notch event
2887940 don didnt hesitate to raise the purse again this year
2887941 we are thrilled to have peter here for the first time he is a very popular player out here with the fans
2887942 to mobilize the community like this event does is just a perfect fit
2887943 weve increased our charity because thats important to the tour and to us
2887944 he looked poised for a young guy and mike has to be happy with his quarterback coming out and looking fairly sharp
2887945 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2887946 i thought for his first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2887947 i thought it was important for me to get out there tonight and compete against a team we know is going to be very successful
2887948 i thought it was a good start i still have a long way to go and im glad that one is under my belt
2887949 thats a lot of fun to get in there against some of their starters and get some work
2887950 i settled down and did some good things and some bad things but got more comfortable as i went along
2887951 i dont have any doubt not just because i was here i know thats a good football team and i thought our guys stood in there and went toe to toe with them in the first half thats a positive
2887952 everybody is pulling for each other to become better and at the same time everybody wants to be out on the field
2887953 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2887954 you have to get focused and give it a go
2887955 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2887956 i got a good piece of wood on that one
2887957 we had a couple of ducks on the pond and thats when i step it up
2887958 i made some terrible pitches with guys in scoring position
2887959 we have to win as many games as we can the way the division is its crucial for us to keep playing and keep plugging along
2887960 to win three out of four against their pitching staff is pretty good
2887961 theyve got an outstanding staff and getting three is big
2887962 ich mag single sign ons nicht ich glaube nicht daran
2887963 by 1969 black artists were following rocks lead and recording extended epics
2887964 the demand for prior withdrawal of the invaders is just and our government supports it cuban president raul castro said in a written statement

2887966 the resources sector is dragging the market down but thats to be expected as metal prices were softer overnight
2887967 the banks are all higher but the market is still sceptical about the rally
2887968 what we have seen in the past with the commonwealth grants commission is that theyve always had enough political pressure on them to take into consideration the unique position of queensland as the most decentralised state
2887969 weve always been able to maintain a significant advantage even from the labor party have protested against it
2887970 we think were in with a very good chance this year
2887971 at the last olympic games in 2004 the americans easily won the gold with two invasions in the previous three years with britain getting the silver russia didnt even show we havent won the gold since 1996 when the judges were impressed by our levelling of grozny this year i expect russias armed forces to get the gold back for us ive already received a call from our olympic committee telling us that the judges are impressed by the reported civilian death toll and by the synchronised obliteration display put on by our heavy artillery israel were briefly in with a shout which is absurd they didnt even do a proper invasion of lebanon they just bombed an airport russia shows the world how this sort of thing is done old school style
2887972 its absurd that russia is using this in an attempt to win olympic glory its like something from a satirical news website or something
2887973 i am sickenified by this outrageous news if id attacked iran like all them internets conspiracy theorists and rednecks said i would then this terrible tragedy would not be occuring

2887989 which is a bacteria thats found in the bowels of a significant proportion of the population its usually not a problem unless the persons immune system is off balance either by illness infection or by the use of certain antibiotics and thats why in hospitals it tends to become a problem
2887990 youre going to get into a bit of trouble there are so many things that are out of your control especially on a motorcycle you have to be the defensive driver in all situations typically the motorcycle will never win against a vehicle of any size

2887999 a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step
2888000 we dont proactively go out and remove phones without reason we go through a process which includes factors such as consulting with the community local businesses and if appropriate local municipal governments and law enforcement before we determine if that removal is warranted
2888001 the fact is some of the people around that area where there were two bears that were shot he said their garbage pickup is very very poor i used to get it between 30 and 40 calls a day or e mails a day about that service
2888002 if any pedestrians cyclists other vehicle traffic or anybody walking along the street observed the accident please give our collision investigation unit a call at 717 3012
2888003 the statistics dont show anything unusual happening other than you have a lot of planes and helicopters flying around right now there doesnt seem to be any connection to all of these
2888004 so that would include things such as industrial processes things such as the manufacturing of aluminum and cement
2888005 please tell mr stuart hamm that alvaro mart n g mez is here

2888031 i kissed a girl and i liked it i hope my boyfriend dont mind it
2888032 sounds like the type who makes out with her best friend just to get a dudes attention
2888033 i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest i heard the bullets hitting the chassis
2888034 my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was turned to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire
2888035 i got out this morning a friend found me and brought me out on the back of his motorbike i was already waiting for death in my basement the city is in ruins there are bodies lying in the street
2888036 all i have left is the clothes im standing in and these two bags my house was wooden it was turned to splinters by the shells i climbed out of the ruins i dont know where i will go i dont know what to do
2888037 i saw our house in flames as we ran theres nothing left for us to go back to our lives are ruined
2888038 people have no water no electricity no gas and no food
2888039 my relatives told me georgian soldiers burnt to death a family of seven people in their apartment an 18 year old boy who climbed out into the street for a few moments was shot dead by a sniper
2888040 we sat for four days in a cellar without food and water
2888041 when we came out we saw the whole street had burnt down the city was gone only ruins were left it was a slaughter first they bombed and shelled us then the tanks came in and levelled the city to the ground
2888042 i dont know what i will do now my town no longer exists my brother is still there fighting
2888043 when the firing died down i ran out to the home of my relatives on a different street
2888044 i saw that the city hospital was completed destroyed and around it lay corpses and injured people a lot of them and the injured lay there dying for three days because no one could get to them
2888045 where were the russian troops for the first three days now they say on television that russia defended us they saved south ossetia but thats rubbish
2888046 russian tanks only came this morning when we had already pushed the georgian forces out of tskhinvali we did it ossetians ourselves at the cost of many lives and russia came only at the end to take up positions that we had already won and now im lying here and my friends go on dying there
2888047 ossetian patriots first let us cleanse our markets of georgian spies then forward to liberate the homeland
2888048 we are sending men who have done military service so teenage lads dont go to die
2888049 in tskhinvali you cant find one brick standing on top of another the city is still disputed there are georgian strong points on the hills surrounding it im going back to fight tonight ive got my own team of guys
2888050 my cousin came from dmenis village last night he got two bullets in the back were going to go there and slaughter the georgians like the fascist pigs they are if the russians let us well smash them all the way to tbilisi we are a warrior race we know how to fight
2888051 the georgians hit our positions with grad missiles they surrounded us but we managed to break out if im needed ill be heading back
2888052 a 78 year old woman with an infant under each arm was crushed by a tank
2888053 a lot of volunteers are getting held up in the north of the republic but we wanted to get straight to the action
2888054 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2888055 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2888056 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2888057 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2888058 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2888059 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2888060 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2888061 im not sure i would have been able to handle him in any case today
2888062 no doubt he has talent and hes been able to keep this up for five or six weeks
2888063 its been a good week considering that i was only hitting the ball again a week ago after not being able to move my neck im looking to improve and carry it forward next week in washington
2888064 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
2888065 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness
2888066 executives realize that if employees are stressed out financially have excess debt it really makes them less productive
2888067 theres a real financial benefit to the company a long term financial benefit for their employees to be on track for retirement and financially fit
2888068 if a company doesnt have a competitive 401 k program in place its going to be very difficult to compete for talent
2888069 were going to do first second third down two minute red zone all in one practice
2888070 does he have the formation right the snap count right the mike linebacker point out right the read right and then the throw
2888071 we can take away x y and z its not going to happen
2888072 the play breaks down and this is where the receivers are flowing this is how you should flow
2888073 especially in that 24 hours my first nfl game big game it was my birthday and then i had a baby on my birthday it was all in 24 hours it was a good couple of days
2888074 i was going straight to the hospital i took the team flight back we got to the complex around 3 30 in the morning and i got to the hospital around 4 she arrived later that night
2888075 the stats on the baby seven pounds three ounces 20 inches
2888076 born 8 08 08 at 9 04 p m my birthday too its pretty sweet
2888077 the first play we were just watching the safeties seeing how they were biting down
2888078 we did play action and clowney is just as fast as fast can be the safeties came down a little bit on the run he beat them over the top and i put it out there and let him run
2888079 it was kind of watching the safety david got outside i put it out to him again and he was able to get it again and go down the sideline
2888080 you saw the physical attributes hes got size a strong arm and hes a smart guy
2888081 that quarterback room sets a pretty high bar for work ethic and hes right there with them hes impressive in terms of just continually absorbing the chunks of information and getting better the guy thats here now versus the guy that was here a year ago its night and day
2888082 im definitely trying to do that and trying to get a roster spot for myself
2888083 as a receiver you cant make plays you cant get anything done without your quarterback
2888084 definitely i consider myself a deep threat and i have since high school
2888085 my speed thats always been my notch on anybody else
2888086 the fact that you can get the ball down the field and have someone who can get the ball to where it gets the defense on its heels a little bit you enjoy speed
2888087 david just wants to make sure hes not a one hit wonder that there are some other singles coming out here in his future
2888088 hes doing everything weve asked him to do as a coach youre really proud of guys like brett ratliff and david clowney when they marry their talent to their work ethic

2888091 africans need food water and so on but we also need affordable computing i believe that africa is about to miss a great development opportunity in much the same way as it lost out in the industrial revolution unless serious and committed efforts are made by africa to address the rapid expansion of the digital divide mandela i am certain that africa has to own its development processes a lack of specialised knowledge means that africans are using computer and internet systems that they are not involved in producing
2888092 the flare up of major hostilities between russia and georgia has been dubbed by some
2888093 the fighting backfired and the russian counteroffensive now seems aimed at capturing the 40 of south ossetia which was under georgian control until last week
2888094 they the russians control pretty much all of south ossetia now
2888095 the conflict could widen already georgias other separatist region the black sea enclave of abkhazia is mobilising and soon tbilisi could find itself fighting on two fronts other small nations could become involved in a broader caucasian war
2888096 the conflict spreads further still bringing in former soviet republics such as ukraine which like georgia aspires to nato membership and kazakhstan which is loyal to moscow the war in yugoslavia would seem like small fry compared with any war among former soviet republics

2888098 ive never been under the illusion that i was going to wake up one day and the dvr menace was just going to disappear this just makes the ad skipping problem even more urgent
2888099 the appeals court has opened the door to a massive increase in the penetration of dvr capabilities
2888100 today dvr penetration stands at roughly 25 percent of tv households in short order effective dvr penetration could now jump to north of 60 percent
2888101 well see an acceleration of dvr type technology and that will destroy the present ad model

2888109 many countries have given us duty and quota free access but the us has not bangladesh strongly presented its case when it was proposed that the facility should be provided to non ldc countries pakistan and sri lanka bangladesh demanded the facility as a ldc country
2888110 in the face of the demand it had been decided that
2888111 but we succeeded in making the african countries understand what was being tried we assured them of giving concession in duty and quota free access to some of their commodities if necessary
2888112 all will have to do their bits to expand trade in internal and international arena and ensure political stability at home we hope good sense will prevail over everyone

2888116 when youve been married 34 years you dont have to say much
2888117 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2888118 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2888119 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2888120 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2888121 there has been a lot of comment today regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2888122 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player
2888123 the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2888124 there is no water no light no bread no gas nothing its a nightmare
2888125 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2888126 they are trying to turn 2008 into a year of mourning for china
2888127 i admit that we face a severe campaign because i know that these people will not lose their momentum
2888128 with the special background of the eve of the beijing olympic games hostile forces at home and abroad will surely act like cornered mad dogs and step up their terror and sabotage activities
2888129 finally we start to see his smile not everybody knows that he hadnt played an official game for four months but a talented player like him will retrieve his form very fast
2888130 even now i can retrace the first steps i took as a child and be stunned by the beauty of the islands the trembling blue plane of the pacific the moss coloured cliffs the north shores thunderous waves

2888135 its john mccain who wears 500 italian shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state its barack obama that climbed up the hard way
2888136 its funny to have anybody characterise barack as an elitist
2888137 you know this kid who was raised by a single mother has walked away his entire life from lucrative careers to work in the community
2888138 as you may know not long ago a couple of hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2888139 i think the blue skies will come especially after todays rain ive got my fingers crossed hopefully tomorrow will be better
2888140 the readings that we were looking at indicated that we have no cause for concern at this stage
2888141 it feels like youre at 3 000 metres because of the air you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog right now im just knackered
2888142 we seem to be stuck in a weather pattern that is bringing us high humidity and higher than normal temperatures but despite all this the air quality continues to remain in the satisfactory range that does not pose any threat to the athletes
2888143 on the ipfw campus i have come into contact with many more obama supporters than mccain supporters i even know a few people that are working full time for the obama campaign this semester
2888144 skelly not so very long ago as a matter of fact i became totally convinced that we can find what we are looking for and we will find it if were looking for it and we shouldnt be uncertain about

2888153 an arrhythmia is almost always the cause of sudden death he said
2888154 the heart develops this chaotic rhythm it quivers and doesnt pump out blood and the person loses consciousness
2888155 this type of occurrence happens at least once in most city2surf races
2888156 people shouldnt undertake this sort of activity without training for it it tends to stress themselves out

2888162 after waiting for all our luggage to come out i see that everyone has there gear but mine is still missing
2888163 a lot of people are waiting so i still have faith

2888173 the court ultimately came to a very very wrong conclusion the first notice that the mbta provided that they were going to the court was after they had gone to the court
2888174 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code programs or similar type of information to a computer and does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans
2888175 reflects the courts view that they believe that the massachusetts bay transit authority was likely to succeed on the merits we think thats actually not the case some of the material in the students talk regarding security problems with the mbtas electronic ticketing system had been previously reported in the boston globe and boston herald newspapers
2888176 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years
2888177 my style is very americana i gravitate to pieces that are american by nature either western or depression era
2888178 well gee i never intend to sell anything so its not my fault that i do i entered anyway
2888179 my whole life began to revolve around pregnancy it was excruciating
2888180 i asked myself all the usual questions why did it have to happen to us what did we ever do wrong it was a massive emotional drain every waking minute was consumed with the thought of having a baby
2888181 it put a lot of strain on us as a couple as well every month youd be roaring crying and trying to pick yourself back up again once you knew you werent pregnant by the time we got round to doing ivf the strain was tremendous
2888182 we learnt breathing techniques and relaxation therapy which was very useful when it came to dealing with that agonising wait for the phone call to tell you how many of your eggs have fertilised
2888183 we also did yoga classes and picked up some meditation techniques they were very simple things that could be used in everyday life but they were really effective
2888184 plus being surrounded by other couples who were in the same position as us was so much help we began to feel much more hopeful
2888185 after that we got pregnant pretty soon and although sadly we miscarried now we are expecting twins and we are over the moon
2888186 were only beginning to realise now that the incidence of anxiety and depression among ivf patients is actually huge
2888187 these people sadly are much more distressed than doctors realised given that there seems to be a strong correlation between distress and pregnancy from a medical point of view it makes sense to address those stress levels
2888188 what i see with the irish couples that i meet is that theyre panicking about getting on the ladder for ivf so that doesnt help
2888189 at every stage of that journey you need support i find cognitive behavioural therapy very useful because it challenges your core beliefs so many women think that pregnancy is never going to happen for them
2888190 we go right back to asking them about their behaviour in childhood about their worries fears and anxieties and then we come up with a plan of action
2888191 if a woman is stressed tearful or anxious then cbt can be very useful for her
2888192 cbt is very much here and now focused and ivf is a hugely stressful procedure both physically and emotionally for couples who are going through it one of the main things i focus on is their stress levels and how we can cope better with them
2888193 i was used to putting my mind to something and then getting it
2888194 so when the most natural thing in the world suddenly becomes the most difficult thats really hard
2888195 we try to find out is there anything that can be done to ease the burden of ivf for them for instance by taking time out during the cycle of treatment
2888196 we ask do they have a good diet what do they take to relieve stress are they active in a gym and if they are could they replace that with something more soothing like yoga or acupuncture or reflexology
2888197 its a rollercoaster ride for couples there are massive sad days where you have to let go of your hopes and dreams but i wouldnt like to portray it as being only a hard thing most people i see get through this programme pretty well if theyre united going in in the first place it is not all doom and gloom
2888198 i think its really good that doctors are beginning to realise how much stress levels impact on pregnancy itself
2888199 it hadnt really occurred to me when i started out just how much stress does affect you as i had always thought of myself generally as a fairly laid back person
2888200 but i remember when i was going through ivf having a huge screaming row with my mother
2888201 now i realise that if you are going to be anxious it does affect you and if theres anything you can do to relieve some of the anxiety of infertility it has to be worth doing
2888202 their whole attitude is different theyve got life to them
2888203 i would caution that you could go broke waiting for these investments to turn around you can be right in the long run and go out of business in the short run
2888204 while the one year mumbai interbank forward rate is 7 to 8 per cent the yield on a one year treasury bill is 9 25 to 9 5 per cent and a aaa rated corporate bond earns a yield of 10 to 10 5 per cent so there is a substantial arbitrage opportunity of at least 2 percentage points
2888205 whos he think is keepin that fat bitch in devil dogs
2888206 de eerste helft zat ik rustig achterovergeleund op de bank maar we lieten de vs terug in de wedstrijd komen
2888207 shota heeft nog geprobeerd om louis in portugal te bellen maar dat is niet gelukt toen hebben wij hem gezegd dat hij moet doen wat hem te doen staat
2888208 de vrouw en kinderen van shota zitten momenteel aan de zwarte zee kust maar de paspoorten van de kinderen liggen in tbilisi via zijn connecties wil hij de papieren bij zijn familie krijgen zelf probeert hij naar turkije te vliegen om dan met een auto de grens over te gaan maar hij keerde zaterdag toen wij tegen iraklis speelden vergeefs terug van schiphol
2888209 maar shota maakt zich grote zorgen over zijn hele familie
2888210 the biopsy that was performed did not show any evidence of skin cancer
2888211 en de headset van het arbitrale trio kan daarbij wel eens een belangrijke rol spelen
2888212 en ik moet me vergissen als die niet van de assistent scheidsrechters zijn
2888213 de koptelefoons staan de hele wedstrijd open en ik denk dat de leden van de tuchtcommissie de bevindingen van de grensrechters als wettig bewijs zullen beschouwen het is niet zo dat een 3 2 uitslag in het voordeel van van hulten doorslaggevend is maar over het algemeen wordt meer waarde gehecht aan verklaringen van officials dan van spelers
2888214 dit laat zien wat de kracht is van het programma van de zwembond
2888215 het is niet zo dat we in nederland toevallig n talent hebben als je een estafette wint geeft dat de breedte van je top weer hoe goed er getraind wordt hoe de faciliteiten zijn als je dan als miniatuurstaatje iedereen achter je laat is dat geweldig dat lukt niet met geluk

2888226 these are still early days to estimate the size of the 3g market in india
2888227 apart from the standard music and video downloads expect a host of india specific content that is what will drive demand for 3g services here
2888228 india is one more market that the iphone is being launched but for the iphone to be really effective it is imperative that 3g services are launched
2888229 but im not necessarily for guns i just see so much violence that involves guns where the guns end up being used against the owner
2888230 it brought to my attention that i needed to pick up something that would be effective so i decided pepper sprays tasers stun guns and items like that would probably be best and provide some distance between myself and the person who could attack me ive concentrated on products that would give that distance and could incapacitate an assailant for a period of time
2888231 the blog will provide information that would help people to avoid situations that might get them involved in some type of violent crime

2888235 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2888236 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2888237 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2888238 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2888239 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2888240 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2888241 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2888242 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2888243 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities

2888251 get rich or die trying making money on the web the black hat way
2888252 for example an insurance adjuster can access claim details while on the road when previously this data resided in a terminal based application
2888253 were bringing forward a concerted effort to heighten the focus on the mobility capability that exists at ibm today to let customers access data and applications from the growing number of mobile devices
2888254 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2888255 as you know i feel very strongly about religion and i am so appreciative of the chance to go to church here in your society
2888256 mr bush told president hu that this is an important aspect of the u s china dialogue and that the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect of our dialogue
2888257 i think president hu was saying youve gone to church today and youve seen christians worshiping openly in our society
2888258 i took it to mean that i think in the future there will be more room for christians and other religious groups in this society
2888259 sends a message to all of the countries in the former soviet space that russia is resurgent and is willing to flex its muscles
2888260 made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2888261 to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2888262 there are already russian aircraft over georgia so the chances of direct engagement between russian and nato aircraft is very high

2888265 today the 31st were buying 200 bikes here in kampala and heading up to gulu in northern uganda
2888266 i always think of you thank you for your kindness
2888267 many of the children took their bikes to bed with them they were so happy to have them
2888268 these are the thank you letters from the children to their sponsors
2888269 we have mixed feelings about whats going on about the people who did not make it
2888270 we pray for them and we pray that we all will be safe
2888271 in the end we have to keep our faith together and keep praying when we go through the bad things in life
2888272 a lot of the things they do i wish i could do half
2888273 we all are very sad but in an optimistic way we believe in gods plan and when this life is over there is another life waiting for us
2888274 from day wear to evening wear its a modern way to update your look
2888275 especially in summer with nice tanned legs its a quirky take on a boyish look
2888276 the dress has been really well received with women saying that it absolutely takes the hassle out of planning their date outfits
2888277 many have joked that it helps them transform in a superman style make over due to the hectic lifestyles that we are all leading these days i believe that in the future more fashion will be focused on two in one versatile outfits that can be altered to suit different occasions
2888278 its good for the world to have girls playing softball and these women are going to show young girls how to win
2888279 want to has nothing to do with it in public life
2888280 that a democratically elected president of georgia and i quote must go
2888281 id like to say straightaway that regime change is an american expression
2888282 we do not use such an expression but sometimes there are occasions and we know from history that there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
2888283 without the departure of saakashvili it is impossible to stop the conflict in south ossetia
2888284 the designers have delivered a fantastic overall look and i am confident that team gb will make an impact
2888285 he is not responding to treatment we wanted to shift him to another hospital but doctors said that he was in no state to be moved
2888286 some of the hotel employees were inebriated and made passes at us later at night they knocked on our doors frightened we called up our managers gautam jain and rajeev mehra who were in another hotel when they arrived the staffers tried to flee prasun who was climbing down a pipe fell and hurt himself
2888287 the state government would be asked to purchase fruit from fruit growers and utilize it locally by distributing among schoolchildren and paramilitary forces
2888288 there is no blockade it has been invented by separatists who after having been caught on the wrong foot are seeking to guilt trip the shri amarnath sangharsh samiti into calling off the jammu agitation which is just and has been completely peaceful
2888289 muslims are behind 99 of all the terror attacks and plans in the west not chinese japanese christians jews hindus buddhists or even wiccans it is time we call a spade a spade
2888290 i am worried well see that the democratic party decided to make history and thus failed to elect a president
2888291 liberemos a la gente de este pa s o al menos la poca que quede viva despues de nuestros operativos militares pol tico libertarios
2888292 long term nation building military engagement in a land torn by ethnic and religious conflict with no exit strategy
2888293 sort of being pimped out in some weird sort of way
2888294 i was going to vote for her but i got in the booth and i just thought about her voice
2888295 perempuan ibarat sumur laki laki ibarat timba tak mungkinlah sumur mencari timba
2888296 daripada duduk duduk malas begitu lebih baik pergi ke sungai cari
2888297 mak beginilah rupanya menjadi permaisuri itu dijunjung tinggi ditayang tayang dirum rum dipuja puja tetapi semuanya hampa belaka aku sendiri kesunyian
2888298 i dont believe any arrangement for children can compete with an intact family where the mother raises her kids and the father is also very involved in their lives
2888299 i intuition and experience suggest that a child benefits from having before his or her eyes every day living models of what both a man and a woman are like
2888300 did not want to hear the science but wanted to if you will preach abstinence which i felt was scientifically incorrect
2888301 you know the politics of sex in secretary of health and human services tommy thompson commenting to him
2888302 when we saw it we said jim youve got a product here
2888303 theres lots of cities just like us that need this technology
2888304 it seemed so simple we wondered why we didnt think of it before
2888305 i think fuel usage wise its a really smart system
2888306 given the fuel prices i would not be surprised if some of the waste companies as well communities that handle waste are looking more seriously at this type of system
2888307 so this is paying for itself more than we ever anticipated it would when we were developing it
2888308 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2888309 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2888310 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2888311 he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
2888312 we dont want adults sending mixed messages to children that its ok to shoot up drugs in order to become a star because its not ok
2888313 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally
2888314 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2888315 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2888316 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2888317 apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet
2888318 this great figure whose poetry which reflects nostalgia and liberty speaks to us all
2888319 theres a finite amount of gas left in this tank and weve used at least half the tank
2888320 some of our soldiers have deployed more frequently than others because of their unique skills and the high demand for those skills
2888321 but weve made progress in adjusting the structure of our force to better meet current operational needs which means more troops share the burden of deployment
2888322 as of now nobody in the lawyer team knows where he is
2888323 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2888324 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2888325 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2888326 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2888327 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2888328 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2888329 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2888330 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan
2888331 this is a voting block that has never been open before and it has opened up at such a time as this
2888332 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2888333 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2888334 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2888335 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2888336 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2888337 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2888338 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2888339 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2888340 lilly you have just six months to learn what pay your male co workers do earn or we will rule your discrimination claim post hoc
2888341 it turned out that i ended up getting paid what i did because of the accumulated effect of pay raise decisions over the years in any given year the difference wasnt that big nothing to make a huge fuss about all by itself
2888342 i have been quite surprised and i must say pleased by the fact that central banks have been able to effectively simulate many of the characteristics of the gold standard by constraining the degree of finance in a manner which effectively brought down the general price levels
2888343 the record of the past 20 years appears to underscore the observation that although pressures for excess issuance of fiat money are chronic a prudent monetary policy maintained over a protracted period of time can contain the forces of inflation
2888344 he hadnt been chief minister very long and that in itself was a difficulty because his record in office was quite short
2888345 a lot of people were probably quite upset by the timing of the election they werent convinced by the reason the chief minister gave
2888346 its not their gig they like to be friendly with all the parties because they cant pick and chose whose going to be in national power
2888347 i think they would run a mile rather than get caught up in some local political shindig
2888348 we deliberately didnt touch on that out of respect for the moment and just acknowledged each others path and what happened on the weekend as member for nelson and member for blain
2888349 it was absolutely amazing within several days after that email being circulated a number of people came to our door and said we heard youre strapped for cash heres our cheque
2888350 their record on education and education is one of the big issues has been appalling through their whole government and basically the chicken has come home to roost
2888351 theres a very very high level of community concern about crime across the northern territory
2888352 both side of politics should commit to auditing the police force and seeing where our resources are
2888353 we are crappy therefore liberal are crappy so why change as the result will be the same
2888354 this swing againt labour would not have been so great if the party had kept clair martin as their leaded for this election
2888355 its obvious that the public has quickly become disenchanted with rudd and the labor brand and the coalition must capitalise on that now
2888356 our policy is that we will not commit to any policy we have no significant policies and will not have any significant policies that is our policy
2888357 i understand why you did it harry but it still hurts
2888358 i needed something to come back to someone to make me want to live
2888359 it ripped my heart out and all i could think was that i wanted to die and be with you
2888360 when will it be i wouldnt miss being there fred was
2888361 his death is still fresh and will be for some months but weve got to keep focused on the positive
2888362 theres going to be a mass for everyone that died during the final battle
2888363 but were going to have our own service for fred at the burrow
2888364 well bury him in the weasley plot in st catchpole
2888365 what part of its not ready yet dont you understand
2888366 good now do just what the recipe calls for i wont let you mess it up
2888367 theyve been there too long already the longer their memory stays modified the harder it will be to undo it
2888368 its not that i dont want you to go its that i dont want you to go alone
2888369 ron they cant see you yet not until i remove their fake memories
2888370 ill eat lunch at a pub while you find them i dont have to be there when you
2888371 besides id rather take some time with them i need
2888372 oh ron i just need to explain things to them i need time
2888373 go see your parents bring them back and then ill meet them
2888374 as you may be aware ive been asked to be minister while thicknesse is being evaluated for the effects of the imperius curse
2888375 it might be less than two weeks theres already talk from some of the department heads about forming a coalition to get someone else in the top spot
2888376 its only been a few days why are they so keen to give you the sack
2888377 i wont be getting the sack as i dont formally have the job ill go back to heading the d m l e
2888378 the person theyre trying to get to replace me isnt too far from the previous administration
2888379 oh there wont be any questioning of blood status or any of that rot
2888380 but if my information is correct the international statute for secrecy will look like a wet napkin compared with what they have planned
2888381 please dont tell me there are witches and wizards who actually liked being rounded up for questioning about their family history
2888382 no but the people who were doing the questioning liked the power they had and are looking for new ways to exploit it
2888383 im working on that but i cant do much in two weeks especially because they are so well funded
2888384 probably thats actually one of the reasons i asked you here
2888385 dracos going on trial for accessory to albus dumbledores murder
2888386 because of voldemorts taking of the ministry there was never a trial
2888387 draco didnt cast the killing curse and he certainly didnt push him off the tower
2888388 but he did disarm him as you said yourself and that makes him accessory
2888389 well i wont pretend that he doesnt deserve to be punished for that or for the stupid ways he tried to kill dumbledore before then he almost killed ron and katie bell
2888390 and hes been charged for those incidents as well as you can guess your testimony will be incredibly valuable in each case
2888391 you may not have a choice in the matter if the wizengamot decides your testimony is necessary youll have to appear or be put into azkaban for contempt
2888392 id like to see you try it that lot out there would tear azkaban down brick by brick to get me out
2888393 you said that was only one of the things you came to see me about
2888394 id like you to consider applying for the auror academy this year
2888395 i havent taken my n e w t s and i havent even finished seventh year at hogwarts
2888396 it says ive been awarded n e w t s in defence transfiguration and charms
2888397 for my role in defeating the darkest wizard in a century
2888398 but what about potions dont i need a n e w t in potions too
2888399 able averys advanced potions pass your n e w t in two weeks
2888400 thats ludicrous i cant take the potions exam in two weeks i dont even know if i want to be an auror any more
2888401 the wizarding world needs you potter you did pretty well back there getting the jump on me with that petrificus totalis and you did everyone a favour by getting rid of voldemort but we still need you
2888402 i just dont know it seems like i deserve a break after all that
2888403 the ministry may not make it without good people like you inside
2888404 ill see you in a couple of days in courtroom ten
2888405 but compared with his attending the olympic games the profit is much larger than the loss
2888406 no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2888407 china will be a better place if there is more freedom of religion
2888408 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2888409 president hu seemed to indicate that the door is opening on religious freedom in china and that in the future there will be more room for religious believers
2888410 it is good that the president can worship here but it is not likely that we will have more freedom or be able to register our churches
2888411 several house churches have been closed before the olympics the police say that we are threatening national security and demand that my husband gives up his faith
2888412 he needs to justify and defend his successful policy towards east asia
2888413 he has been more successful in the region than china
2888414 he did not waver in his decision to come and he emphasized that not going would have been an affront to the chinese people that has been very well received in china
2888415 it is an irony that like other presidents hes finding china a pretty nice place there are no hecklers and he can make his points and the u s can feel superior its a welcome diversion from washington
2888416 something different than that young boy who grew up in a small town in north carolina
2888417 because that young boy would never have done this never thought about doing it
2888418 my first reaction was of all the people not john edwards
2888419 he just fell into a trap that we can all fall into
2888420 i would treat him no differently but he would be snubbed by some people at church this morning our sunday school teacher said a lot of people didnt back him anyway
2888421 no matter what your party affiliation if someone from your town is successful you hate it
2888422 to be involved in something like this my heart goes out to his wife
2888423 that would really be a power trip that really would
2888424 i think almost anyone would kind of lose sight of reality
2888425 if he ran for political office again id vote for him
2888426 he should have been man enough from the start to say i done it
2888427 hes not really very important in american politics right now but im afraid this will just deepen the cynicism that the american people feel towards politicians and politics
2888428 the stunning admission edwards made to abcs bob woodruff and in a written statement from chapel hill on friday afternoon was that hes a narcissist
2888429 he admitted that wallowing in self focus out on the trail and thinking youre special can result in a solipsism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and therell be no consequences
2888430 auto psychoanalysis by the perp thats really rich when bill clinton acknowledged an affair after equally adamant denials he simply went into an old fashioned spiral of penitence his allegedly long dark night of his alleged soul
2888431 even in confessing to preening edwards was preening his diagnosis of narcissism was weirdly narcissistic or was it self narcissistic given his diagnosis im sure his h m o would pay
2888432 the creepiest part of his creepy confession was when he stressed to woodruff that he cheated on elizabeth in 2006 when her cancer was in remission his infidelity was oncologically correct
2888433 there is some sincerity and some snake oil in every politician but john edwards exudes both in almost freakish measure
2888434 maybe slippery john somehow convinced earnest john that this moment would never come in fact it was inevitable and if edwards had somehow won the democratic nomination the party would be in the midst of a historic meltdown
2888435 im not sure theres any issue where they differ as much as this sometimes we complain in politics that democrats and republicans run to the center and they copy each other with their proposals at least in health care we dont have to worry about that
2888436 our proposal is to give every family in america a 5 000 refundable tax credit and they take that tax credit and that money a refundable tax credit to go across state lines to go any place in america and go online and pick out the insurance policy they want
2888437 democrats want the government to make the choices thats a fundamental difference
2888438 but if youre one of the 45 million americans who dont have health insurance then you will have it available to you no one will be turned away because of a pre existing condition or illness
2888439 everyone will be able to buy into a new health insurance plan thats similar to the one that every federal employee from a postal worker in iowa to a congressman in washington currently has for themselves
2888440 while sen obama wants to build on top of the employer sponsored insurance system sen mccain wants to build away from it and move more people to the individual insurance market
2888441 the stock democratic health reform solution before bill clinton changed it was a play or pay employer mandate and thats exactly what barack obama has
2888442 and in 1992 the favorite gop solution was tax credits to buy private health insurance so a lot of things have happened in 16 years the health care system is much worse than it was but we pretty much have the same solutions that weve always had
2888443 i just try to conserve everything and make it into the semifinal i try to bank as much rest as i can tonight recover and sleep and try to warm down and get out of here as fast as i can so im not getting so run down
2888444 i was still running off the adrenaline and hyper from this morning
2888445 the 100 back is probably the quickest progressing event in the past year in swimming theres a lot pressure on me but im going to enjoy it as much as possible
2888446 the 100 is just fun for me so im just enjoying it right now setting myself up for the 200 and hopefully get a medal out of it
2888447 for a prelims swim i keep wanting to say morning swim but its night here it felt very relaxed
2888448 im quite shocked actually i had a pretty crazy swim
2888449 that was a little faster than what i expected to do
2888450 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you
2888451 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2888452 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2888453 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2888454 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2888455 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2888456 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2888457 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2888458 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2888459 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2888460 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2888461 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2888462 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2888463 we are made up of people of every conceivable racial background
2888464 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you
2888465 large numbers of these people gt really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2888466 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america

2888468 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that gt we gt have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading gt for complete annihilation as a people

2888477 we are made gt up gt of people of every conceivable racial background
2888478 you talk of times of peace for all and then prepare for war
2888479 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2888480 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
2888481 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
2888482 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2888483 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2888484 ive asked la marque to give up the road in their extraterritorial jurisdiction
2888485 but they voted against it the road has no value its a state right of way were not planning on building a hotel on it
2888486 i sat here monday before the storm and clocked one at 83 mph one at 76 mph and another at 90 mph
2888487 early in the mornings and late in the evenings its like a racetrack
2888488 the city council felt like it was something they didnt want to relinquish
2888489 i would have to send our reserve officers to court and they work other jobs during the day
2888490 we expect to have more people attending than the 800 to 900 who came last year
2888491 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2888492 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2888493 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2888494 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2888495 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2888496 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2888497 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2888498 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2888499 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2888500 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2888501 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city
2888502 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2888503 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything
2888504 im elated and excited a new home is something weve always dreamed about
2888505 the most exciting part of any habitat build is seeing what god can accomplish through people like us
2888506 claims that we can make superior snap decisions by trusting intuition or through the power of unconscious thought have received a great deal of attention in the media
2888507 trust your gut instinct when those shopping decisions get tough say scientists
2888508 at worst theyre outright dangerous in stark contrast to claims made by the dutch research team and in the media we found very little evidence of the superiority of unconscious thought for complex decisions
2888509 on the contrary our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is if conscious thinkers are given adequate time to encode material or are allowed to consult material while they deliberate their choices are at least as good as those made unconsciously
2888510 our study is the first to specifically examine psa screening in younger men which provides an important assessment of quality of care especially for high risk groups
2888511 further investigation will be required to understand the impact of new risk stratification strategies with particular focus on the policy implications of potentially large increases in health care resource use
2888512 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
2888513 the times they are a changin marital status and health differentials from 1972 to 2003
2888514 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
2888515 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
2888516 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
2888517 acid sensitive channel inhibition prevents fetal alcohol spectrum disorders cerebellar purkinje cell loss
2888518 this study demonstrates that direct pharmacological blockade of task 1 and task 3 channels protects the most sensitive target of fetal alcohol exposure cerebellar purkinje cells
2888519 the healthy human mouth is home to a tremendous variety of microbes including viruses fungi protozoa and bacteria
2888520 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
2888521 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue
2888522 this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
2888523 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
2888524 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
2888525 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
2888526 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
2888527 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
2888528 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
2888529 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
2888530 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
2888531 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease
2888532 the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2888533 they hedge their bets a little with inflation and it is not clear that inflation has peaked
2888534 im not sure that this adds to the case for a september cut and i dont think it adds to the case for 50 rather than 25 basis points
2888535 in addition to the effects of tighter financial conditions other factors including a slowing in global growth declining asset markets and higher fuel costs are acting to restrain domestic spending and activity
2888536 any further deterioration in the outlook for global growth would represent a significant downside risk to the domestic activity profile particularly if it led to a marked slowing in growth in china and india
2888537 the rba is now talking about a slowdown in the china and india which i think is new and significant
2888538 as soon as lezak came off that last wall i started going crazy were a team we went in as a team and now were exiting as a team and were going out with that gold that we needed to get back
2888539 ive been on the last two relays where we come up short
2888540 to be honest with you i got really tired of losing
2888541 were becoming more successful in identifying perpetrators in cold cases than we were when we didnt have this technology
2888542 i dont know if there is enough room to keep all of this evidence
2888543 i believe in the innocence movement but youve got to have some common sense injected
2888544 minute men help us blacks invade our home land we are your people we are white just like you help us ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2888545 i am king is a statement about all men we are all descendents of royalty and if we carry ourselves and respect ourselves in that manner and believe in ourselves then we are all kingsit has nothing to do with being arrogant i am king is not a statement about myself i am king is about every man who is going to go and buy the fragrance
2888546 this recognition by one of australias leading wine publications is a credit to the act and region wine industry an indicator of the quality wine and tourism product they provide and the contribution they make to our local economy
2888547 i do not care what you know about the bible when you leave this class you can get an a and go to hell im not interested in making smarter sinners in my class im here to help you know god
2888548 we are here to continue recovering natural resources and the consolidation of nationalisation
2888549 my big dream is to have unity among the bolivian people
2888550 they will either talk more in the language of de facto secession or start to negotiate
2888551 even if the government is strengthened it has to negotiate there is no other option
2888552 were sorry the clip you are trying to play is not currently available
2888553 were sorry the clip you are trying to play is not currently available gt in your area
2888554 i tried to go out faster i tried a lot harder but it wasnt faster and it ended up being an overall waste of our time
2888555 i should have been in the final i have that in me its disappointing i wont be there
2888556 the trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt
2888557 i would be shocked if edwards did not have the affair
2888558 i wouldnt be so quick to dismiss the enquirer they have broken several high profile stories in the last few years
2888559 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2888560 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2888561 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2888562 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2888563 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2888564 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2888565 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2888566 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2888567 the taipei auckland route is incurring losses on lower than expected demand worse high oil prices have further impacted our bottom line
2888568 im not so sure he shouldnt be impeached or recalled whichever is swifter for doing that
2888569 what the hell did we used do with our time
2888570 sometimes following your path to achieve your goals requires sacrifice or foregoing the activities that others are free to do

2888572 what is the one thing you are most afraid of
2888573 we especially like this subversive giles amp brother ribbon key chain by philip crangi
2888574 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2888575 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2888576 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2888577 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2888578 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2888579 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2888580 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town
2888581 when the iphone came out we were excited about the big screen the graphics chip and the good components
2888582 we thought it was an opportunity too big to pass up
2888583 wow this is a strange and interesting turn of events
2888584 damn boy youre a bad ass i wish i could be like you when my balls drop oh wait you havent dealt with that yet dont worry about it as cool as you are you dont need to fret
2888585 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2888586 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
2888587 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months

2888591 an expected future to come v the realistic future to come
2888592 wir m ssen ber verhandlungen sprechen und ber eine politische l sung eine milit rische gibt es nicht
2888593 inakzeptabel besonders wenn sie von dem vertreter eines landes stammen dessen aktionen im irak afghanistan und serbien uns allen wohlbewusst sind
2888594 the spirit of 8 8 88 must never be allowed to die
2888595 the wild west because it is so easy to steal there
2888596 it would be number one on the new york times bestseller list
2888597 in russia its quite normal for men to slap women it is cultural it is part of life
2888598 no problem the price is 10 000 with the girl landed it is simple it is easy to get access to the girls its a phone call i know the brokers in moscow st petersburg and kyiv i can call moscow tomorrow and show you how easy it is i can get ten to fifteen to twenty girls shipped to me in a week
2888599 they know why they are coming and what they are going to do they will not be any trouble
2888600 that is bullshit i never trafficked in women i dont need trafficked women agents in russia are overwhelmed with women who want to do this voluntarily if you look at their living conditions in russia there is no way of surviving they live in poverty at least this way they can make a living when people need to eat what are you going to do
2888601 my opinion is a prostitute is someone who is selling herself from that point of view that is what they are it is true they definitely do not want to do this they are being pushed by their social level of their life theyre getting pushed by necessity theyre being pushed to survive then maybe theyre not really prostitutes
2888602 the girls come here and they send some money home and the family lives if they dont come to work here or in germany or england their family suffers i give the girls a chance to earn money for me it is a business transaction plain and simple but i am also helping these women out
2888603 ive heard that a lot of these women have no idea theyre going into prostitution when they accept these so called job offers to work abroad
2888604 in fact ive read that a lot of them think theyre going to be waitresses or hotel cleaning staff
2888605 i think 10 percent dont know what theyre getting into ninety percent know exactly what theyre going to do what they may not know exactly is the conditions or how much money they will get
2888606 you dont have a problem with pushing women who are absolutely destitute into prostitution
2888607 look thats what they can offer life is a business its a trade you want to give something for nothing you can help once or twice but then ten twenty or forty times for that you want to get something in return
2888608 how much will it cost to bring a woman over and what kind of profit can be made
2888609 if it is run the proper way the clean way you can have a good clientele and make a lot of money you can buy a woman for 10 000 and you can make your money back in a week if she is pretty and she is young then everything else is profit
2888610 you know after 9 11 how difficult it was supposed to be to get into the united states i will show you right now how easily we can get into the united states and then come back and nobody will ever know we were in there

2888629 we will continue to pursue peace the fighting in north cotabato will not in any way disrupt our focus for a genuine and lasting peace in mindanao
2888630 let us disabuse ourselves from the notion that mr saakashvili is some glorious democrat
2888631 we are right now suffering because we want to be free and we want to be a democracy multi ethnic democracy that belongs to all ethnic groups and thats exactly whats happening there so basically i have to i mean its not about georgia anymore its about america its values
2888632 you know i went to two u s universities i always thought that these values were also those of my own we have held them not because we love america although i do love america but because we love freedom and the point here is that i also thought that america also stands up for those free loving nations and supports them
2888633 a combination of american recklessness serious miscalculation and over reach by georgian president mikheil saakashvili as well as russias forceful reassertion of its regional national interests and status as an oil and gas rich tough international player means america and europe have yet again helped generate a crisis that tests u s global credibility
2888634 saakashvilis decision to send tanks into south ossetia gave russia the trigger that it may have wanted to send in more of its own troops and weapon systems russia was ready putin now prime minister of russia but still the ce nter of power was relaxing and chatting with george w bush in the birds nest olympic stadium in beijing looking quite in control and confident
2888635 saakashvilis own recklessness and overconfidence to further understand the reasons why tanks from both sides rolled into south ossetia

2888712 percaya diri itu skill framework dan paradigma bisa dipahami dipelajari dan dilatih diakselerasi mendahului usia atau karir anda atau diroketkan dan diledakkan menembus batas yang selama ini memenjarakan anda percaya diri adalah induk dari segala life skill anda
2888713 believe in yourself have faith in your abilities without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy
2888714 people who ask confidently get more than those who are hesitant and uncertain when youve figured out what you want to ask for do it with certainty boldness and confidence
2888715 when you allow yourself to begin to dream big dreams creatively abandon the activities that are taking up too much of your time and focus your inward energies on alleviating your main constraints you start to feel an incredible sense of power and confidence
2888716 confidence can get you where you want to go and getting there is a daily process its so much easier when you feel good about yourself your abilities and talents
2888717 giving people self confidence is by far the most important thing that i can do because then they will act
2888718 there was never any fear for me no fear of failure if i miss a shot so what
2888719 it doesnt matter who you are where you come from the ability to triumph begins with you always
2888720 only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master for this reason mastery demands all of a person
2888721 you will either step forward into growth or you will step back into safety
2888722 outstanding leaders go out of their way to boost the self esteem of their personnel if people believe in themselves its amazing what they can accomplish
2888723 security is mostly a superstition it does not exist in nature nor do the children of men as a whole experience it avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure life is either a daring adventure or nothing
2888724 whatever you fear most has no power it is your fear that has the power
2888725 how am i going to live today in order to create the tomorrow im committed to
2888726 we are not animals we are not a product of what has happened to us in our past we have the power of choice
2888727 through persistence self knowledge prayer commitment optimism a resolute trust in god and the building of your own personal moral strength you can enjoy the blessings of a deeper faith and face the difficulties of life with courage and confidence
2888728 even if you havent encountered great success yet there is no reason you cant bluff a little and act like you have confidence is a magnet in the best sense of the word it will draw people to you and make your daily life and theirs a lot more pleasant
2888729 i knew there was a way out i knew there was another kind of life because i had read about it i knew there were other places and there was another way of being
2888730 if you wait until all the lights are green before you leave home youll never get started on your trip to the top
2888731 the starting point of great success and achievement has always been the same it is for you to dream big dreams there is nothing more important and nothing that works faster than for you to cast off your own limitations than for you to begin dreaming and fantasizing about the wonderful things that you can become have and do
2888732 you are the only person on earth who can use your ability
2888733 we create stress for ourselves because you feel like you have to do it you have to i dont feel that anymore
2888734 a lot of people are afraid to tell the truth to say no thats where toughness comes into play toughness is not being a bully its having backbone
2888735 here at work were all just trying to get a job done my people have the confidence of their convictions and they know their skills
2888736 the old saying that success breeds success has something to it its that feeling of confidence that can banish negativity and procrastination and get you going the right way
2888737 action is a great restorer and builder of confidence inaction is not only the result but the cause of fear perhaps the action you take will be successful perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow but any action is better than no action at all
2888738 remember a real decision is measured by the fact that youve taken new action if theres no action you havent truly decided
2888739 competition is always a fantastic thing and the computer industry is intensely competitive whether its google or apple or free software weve got some fantastic competitors and it keeps us on our toes
2888740 we are the creative force of our life and through our own decisions rather than our conditions if we carefully learn to do certain things we can accomplish those goals
2888741 every day youll have opportunities to take chances and to work outside your safety net sure its a lot easier to stay in your comfort zone in my case business suits and real estate but sometimes you have to take risks when the risks pay off thats when you reap the biggest rewards
2888742 somehow i cant believe that there are any heights that cant be scaled by a man who knows the secrets of making dreams come true this special secret it seems to me can be summarized in four c s they are curiosity confidence courage and constant
2888743 confidence is the most important single factor in this game and no matter how great your natural talent there is only one way to obtain and sustain it work
2888744 a clear vision backed by definite plans gives you a tremendous feeling of confidence and personal power
2888745 some of the best business and nonprofit ceos ive worked with over a sixty five year consulting career were not stereotypical leaders they were all over the map in terms of their personalities attitudes values strengths and weaknesses
2888746 i am not looking like armani today and somebody else tomorrow i look like ralph lauren and my goal is to constantly move in fashion and move in style without giving up what i am
2888747 i have great faith in fools self confidence my friends call it
2888748 people ask how can a jewish kid from the bronx do preppy clothes does it have to do with class and money it has to do with dreams
2888749 whether you think you can or think you cant you are right
2888750 make the most of yourself for that is all there is of you
2888751 im not old enough to play baseball or football im not eight yet my mom told me when you start baseball you arent going to be able to run that fast because you had an operation i told mom i wouldnt need to run that fast when i play baseball ill just hit them out of the park then ill be able to walk
2888752 aerodynamically the bumblebee shouldnt be able to fly but the bumblebee doesnt know that so it goes on flying anyway
2888753 what a man thinks of himself that it is which determines or rather indicates his fate
2888754 even if youre extremely skilled and talented a lack of self confidence can prevent you from performing at your best in pressure situations
2888755 the day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them they have either lost confidence that you can help them or concluded that you do not care either case is a failure of leadership
2888756 the history of the world is full of men who rose to leadership by sheer force of self confidence bravery and tenacity
2888757 what is it that you like doing if you dont like it get out of it because youll be lousy at it you dont have to stay with a job for the rest of your life because if you dont like it youll never be successful in it
2888758 it makes no sense to worry about things you have no control over because theres nothing you can do about them and why worry about things you do control the activity of worrying keeps you immobilized
2888759 if money is your hope for independence you will never have it the only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge experience and ability
2888760 i consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among men the greatest asset i possess the way to develop the best that is in a man is by appreciation and encouragement
2888761 ive learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success
2888762 the older i get the more centered i become and the more i think i really know about myself what i know is that what other people do doesnt really have any effect on me
2888763 the worst things in history have happened when people stop thinking for themselves especially when they allow themselves to be influenced by negative people thats what gives rise to dictators avoid that at all costs stop it first on a personal level and you will have contributed to world sanity as well as your own
2888764 ever notice how your senses are heightened when you are in challenging situations youre experiencing an adrenaline rush that gives you extra energy if you see every day as a challenge youd be surprised how efficient you can become and how much can be accomplished
2888765 a leader has the vision and conviction that a dream can be achieved he inspires the power and energy to get it done
2888766 i mean theres no arguing there is no anything there is no beating around the bush youre fired is a very strong term
2888767 i have always loved the competitive forces in this business you know i certainly have meetings where i spur people on by saying hey we can do better than this how come we are not out ahead on that thats what keeps my job one of the most interesting in the world
2888768 a happy life consists not in the absence but in the mastery of hardships
2888769 if i regarded my life from the point of view of the pessimist i should be undone i should seek in vain for the light that does not visit my eyes and the music that does not ring in my ears i should beg night and day and never be satisfied i should sit apart in awful solitude a prey to fear and despair but since i consider it a duty to myself and to others to be happy i escape a misery worse than any physical deprivation
2888770 if youre a car salesman and someone says this is a terrible car im not buying it it doesnt mean they hate you they just dont like your product i think thats a mistake a lot of people in show business make theyre so tied to their act they take everything personally
2888771 we would accomplish many more things if we did not think of them as impossible
2888772 its easy to have faith in yourself and have discipline when youre a winner when youre number one what youve got to have is faith and discipline when youre not yet a winner
2888773 its easy to have principles when youre rich the important thing is to have principles when youre poor
2888774 using the power of decision gives you the capacity to get past any excuse to change any and every part of your life in an instant
2888775 you dont have to be the biggest to beat the biggest
2888776 an optimist is a person who sees a green light everywhere while the pessimist sees only the red stoplight the truly wise person is colorblind
2888777 each of us has much more hidden inside us than we have had a chance to explore unless we create an environment that enables us to discover the limits of our potential we will never know what we have inside of us
2888778 we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender
2888779 if i set for myself a task be it so trifling i shall see it through how else shall i have confidence in myself to do important things
2888780 of all the things that can have an effect on your future i believe personal growth is the greatest we can talk about sales growth profit growth asset growth but all of this probably will not happen without personal growth
2888781 the true value of a human being is determined primarily by the measure and the sense in which he has attained to liberation from the self
2888782 the greatest glory in living lies not in never falling but in rising every time we fall
2888783 i made a resolve then that i was going to amount to something if i could and no hours nor amount of labor nor amount of money would deter me from giving the best that there was in me and i have done that ever since and i win by it i know
2888784 know the enemy and know yourself in a hundred battles you will never peril
2888785 the most important thing is gods blessing and if you believe in god and you believe in yourself you have nothing to worry about
2888786 a big part of financial freedom is having your heart and mind free from worry about the what ifs of life
2888787 the turning point i think was when i really realized that you can do it yourself that you have to believe in you because sometimes thats the only person that does believe in your success but you
2888788 success seems to be connected with action successful people keep moving they make mistakes but they dont quit
2888789 one of the things that may get in the way of people being lifelong learners is that theyre not in touch with their passion if youre passionate about what it is you do then youre going to be looking for everything you can to get better at it
2888790 im pretty passionate about things i do and particularly at this age because i dont have to do the things i dont want to and ive got more things that i do want to do than i can do
2888791 there is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit ones errors it not only clears up the air of guilt and defensiveness but often helps solve the problem created by the error
2888792 the two worst strategic mistakes to make are acting prematurely and letting an opportunity slip to avoid this the warrior treats each situation as if it were unique and never resorts to formulae recipes or other peoples opinions
2888793 in life and business there are two cardinal sins the first is to act precipitously without thought and the second is to not act at all
2888794 i have to say ive made many mistakes and been humbled many many times but you know what its never too late to learn
2888795 you have to pretend youre 100 percent sure you have to take action you cant hesitate or hedge your bets anything less will condemn your efforts to failure
2888796 i never looked at the consequences of missing a big shot when you think about the consequences you always think of a negative result
2888797 with engineering i view this years failure as next years opportunity to try it again failures are not something to be avoided you want to have them happen as quickly as you can so you can make progress rapidly
2888798 success is not built on success its built on failure its built on frustration sometimes its built on catastrophe
2888799 my philosophy is that not only are you responsible for your life but doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment
2888800 dont limit yourself many people limit themselves to what they think they can do you can go as far as your mind lets you what you believe remember you can achieve
2888801 if you want more you have to require more from yourself
2888802 one of the marks of excellent people is that they never compare themselves with others they only compare themselves with themselves and with their past accomplishments and future potential

2889439 when you deregulate whatever industry it might be you should do it carefully and you should do it in stages and everyone should know of changes well in advance
2889440 while cci welcomes mr barnetts preparedness to allow shops to open later on weeknights the same standards must also apply on sundays and for all retailers so they can better meet the needs of their customers
2889441 cci is keen to assess the full detail of the liberal partys policy including the rules that will apply to weeknight trading and what stores if any will be allowed to open on sundays
2889442 ccis research shows that wa consumers want extended trading hours and that deregulation in other states has seen better business for retailers and lower prices for customers
2889443 in 2008 there is no need for us to be told where and when we can shop all other states and territories have reformed their trading hours laws we should do the same the current laws are bad for consumers retailers and the state as they restrict choice competition and innovation in the retail sector they hold back small retailers from growing their businesses
2889444 cci also urges the premier alan carpenter to hold firm on his pledge to deregulate the states retail trading hours laws for the sake of consumers retailers and the wa economy
2889445 cci is concerned the premier appears to be softening his previous commitment to reform

2889452 ada perkembangan baik sekali dibanding minggu lalu sudah bisa mengenali orang
2889453 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
2889454 idahoans want leaders who address issues that affect their families
2889455 tawdry shots between political parties dont serve idahoans who are tired of partisan bickering
2889456 ive worked for 16 months now to improve the political discourse in this state and this is a step backwards
2889457 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
2889458 by the time theyre taking the psat its much too late to determine whether they should be taking algebra in the eighth grade biology and other important gatekeeper classes needed for college
2889459 this test will help schools identify students who have some talent and could likely succeed if they take honors or ap courses but have not been recognized
2889460 just because you go to a public school you should still have the same opportunities
2889461 if you want your kid to go to a highly selective institution you really do have to know in the eighth grade
2889462 theyre locked in a death match with act over who takes the act or the sat once you buy into a certain product line youre likely to stick with it
2889463 by the time they apply to school the results would not be relevant
2889464 that plays out in kids real lives most of them are taking a hodgepodge of classes and by the end of 11th grade its too late
2889465 eighth grade is not the key year for college assessment thats sixth grade
2889466 now were going to have a preadmission test to get ready for the preadmission test get ready to get ready to get ready
2889467 to believe you need an eighth grade test on top of the psat and sat is just insane
2889468 we have people in sacramento and in political offices that think that accountability is testing and accountability is not testing
2889469 the eighth grade california standards test should tell us how children are prepared for high school im not sure we need it again in the ninth grade in the 10th grade and then the 11th grade teachers are so loaded down with tests they have very little time to teach anymore
2889470 our primary purpose is to check on how effectively are schools preparing students and we see them as very important
2889471 california has a very shabby test setup a lot of these testing outfits are entrepreneurial theyre trying to make a buck
2889472 if there is a market to be served to add another test theyre more than willing to do that but if the test is well conceived it will have an instructional yield
2889473 but testing takes time testing costs money you really have to demonstrate that the addition of another test is worth it the jury is still out on that
2889474 i dreamt about this day since i was a little girl on a ranch in alaska
2889475 it was relaxed and romantic i wore a traditional wedding gown and diamonds and he wore jeans and a button down shirt tys definitely my perfect prince
2889476 i know i love the idea of the back nine of a major on a sunday
2889477 i love it so much that im actually disappointed im seven months away from the next major and i dont know what im going to do
2889478 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2889479 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2889480 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
2889481 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2889482 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2889483 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2889484 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2889485 for me personally it is very difficult to believe in that al qaeda is in the gorge
2889486 because to come from afghanistan to that part of georgia they need to cross at least six or seven countries including the caspian sea no al qaeda influence cant be in the country
2889487 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2889488 well since israel and the us are against chavez putin and ahmadinejad they must be good
2889489 russia needs to realize that the empire is gone austro hungarian empire is not coming back the ottoman empire is not coming back and nor is the soviet empire
2889490 as president mikheil saakashvili deflowers his own revolution and shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
2889491 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted some restrictions and called new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
2889492 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
2889493 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
2889494 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2889495 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2889496 report to camp at 8 00 to begin your training
2889497 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2889498 no ones claimed we are in breach of the law and we dont think we are we are continuing as we planned to do at the beginning of the year anyway
2889499 the union will not be wasting any more time or resources on nationals legal challenges
2889500 they have the correspondence and all the information they could possibly need and the commission can foot the argument this time
2889501 the majority 77 percent thinks we should do whatever it takes to protect the environment
2889502 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2889503 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2889504 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2889505 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2889506 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2889507 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2889508 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2889509 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2889510 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2889511 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2889512 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2889513 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2889514 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2889515 more than 80 of american teenagers are concerned about the environment and the role of the united states that is causing pollution
2889516 nationwide 79 of teens are bothered by the fact that america has emerged as the worlds leading pollution source
2889517 bothered them that the america was the worlds leading pollution source
2889518 over 80 of american teens are bothered by the fact that the u s represents one of the worlds leading sources of pollution
2889519 online study discovered that more than 80 of american teenagers are concerned about the environment and the role of the united states in causing pollution
2889520 the time became right to recognize that green is a rapidly growing cultural and business phenomenon and is presenting brand new opportunities and challenges
2889521 and that as a company we should be the green media market leader and be ready
2889522 theres no one more cynical than a disgruntled group of large conglomerate employees they have had many many many mass e mails and initiatives the longer theyre here the more they say ive seen things come ive seen things go so we have a great challenge to be very real
2889523 we heard loud and clear that there was a very high expectation that consumers have about companies over two thirds believe that businesses have some responsibility for the social good thats a lot
2889524 wed like to hear back that weve had an actual impact
2889525 were going to be under a microscope were going to plead for a lot of attention and were going to get it and were really going to try to do everything right what i hope is that the shoutdown of our perceived imperfections doesnt scare anyone else from trying to do it
2889526 should become part of the fabric and rhythm of our every day
2889527 i think its like any pro social initiative that starts with some particular mandate
2889528 it starts out as something conscious something you have to point to and the road is filled with potholes and cynics it would be like saying was our goal in 1987 to hire a woman then never do that again no the goal was to have it become the fabric of medical schools and law schools and board rooms and everything in between the goal was to stop talking about it for it to be part of the everyday
2889529 in a few years we wont have to think about walking any more and our commissaries are going to be right and our lighting is going to be right and our corporate car fleet is going to be right and were going to know how to do it what i found is that we were already doing a tremendous amount of stuff that for a media company we were not particularly good at communicating we never took it on as something we needed to prove to the world i actually think we were incorrect on that

2889538 our survey showed the percentage of local executives who were satisfied with returns from spending on innovation slumped from 53 per cent last year to only 33 per cent in the latest period furthermore more than two thirds of respondents said they were either dissatisfied or unsure of how to rate their organisations payback from innovation
2889539 no doubt assisted by the desire to cut costs in the face of slowing economy and uncertain markets
2889540 were now in a much tougher external environment and innovation will be more important than ever as a means of taking market share creating price premiums and achieving superior returns for shareholders
2889541 economies move in cycles and the cycle is turning decisively in favour of the export and import competing sectors

2889548 im going to keep trying to do my best and see what happens

2889550 i felt like i had to take it out faster than normal my first 100 was almost a second faster than normal
2889551 i felt to even be in the race i kind of needed to do that
2889552 the 200 im will be a little different because i can take it out there and maybe not be as tired
2889553 i want to see him first before i make any judgment there
2889554 i know hes been working out but i just want to sit down and talk to him face to face and make sure everythings set up for him here so he can be successful
2889555 im sure theres some apprehension there but i know he wants to get back going get back up here with the guys
2889556 we took him out and are just easing him back in
2889557 he feels good and i want to make sure he keeps feeling good

2889590 300 film composer tyler bates signs on to score codemasters rise of the argonauts
2889591 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game
2889592 rise of the argonauts is an epic game with some of the biggest greek heroes like jason hercules and achilles which inspired me to compose dramatic sweeping music to create the proper setting for this exciting adventure
2889593 in rise of the argonauts every design choice emphasises immersion we want players to actually feel like theyre heroes in ancient greece not just playing a game tylers experience with composing for film and tv gave him a fresh perspective and his music for the game set the epic tone we were hoping for

2889603 the sunshine coast is well catered for with daily flights from melbourne and sydney and its important for the airports future growth as well as the local tourism industry that an alternative route is added to the flight network

2889608 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
2889609 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
2889610 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
2889611 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
2889612 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified
2889613 risks and benefits of bmi reporting in the school setting
2889614 our feeling is that the information should be given to parents if there is a serious health concern much like any other health concern a child might have
2889615 this information should not be included on a report card or such medical information should be kept separate
2889616 many patients in india enter into clinical trials because they have no better option to receiving care
2889617 one of the major problems of clinical trials in india is that they are not publicized as clinical trials
2889618 physicians are attracted by inducements of foreign travel funds and fame of the four stakeholders the sponsor or drug company hospital investigator and patient three are on one side
2889619 why should we keep india behind everyone else why close our doors for business when we have the capabilities
2889620 since trials for foreign sponsors must follow international rules they actually help raise indian standards the experience with other outsourcing industries has also been that more business has brought better regulation and monitoring
2889621 companies spend resources to train people and bring in expensive equipment
2889622 over time as the overload from big institutes flows to smaller ones in second tier cities the benefits will spread farther
2889623 conducting clinical trials is not like landing a man on the moon
2889624 those who say it will enable india to develop cutting edge technology are talking nonsense
2889625 a little bit careful so as not to bring disrepute to the industry and country

2889640 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
2889641 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change

2889643 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
2889644 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
2889645 we would go out to heards lane to have picnics
2889646 ive done lots of different sports and this is by far the most fun
2889647 when the wind is calm its like sitting on a cloud on your front porch at 3 000 feet you can see everything
2889648 it was a brilliant start i had hardly settled into my seat in my coaching box in the stand when we scored and i got told off for shouting too much

2889655 people in the galveston area should not miss this opportunity to see it and to participate by sharing their stories

2889657 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
2889658 we feel without that our history is being cut short
2889659 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
2889660 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
2889661 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
2889662 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
2889663 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community
2889664 its an even harder sell when you tear it down and dont replace it with exactly what it once was
2889665 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for
2889666 i think having similar buildings within 100 yards of each other is not good business on behalf of the city but im going to talk to our folks talk to city commissioners and meet with lynn ray and see if we cant get something that will make them happy
2889667 i would hate to think it was a black and white issue because this new sanders center is going to be open to the entire city of texas city

2889676 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2889677 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2889678 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2889679 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2889680 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2889681 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2889682 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2889683 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2889684 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2889685 the flight from the home is a flight from yourself from responsibility from the nature of woman in pursuit of false hopes and fading illusions

2889688 many years ago christian pioneers had to fight savage indians today missionaries of these former cultures are being sent via the public schools to heathenize our children
2889689 counterfeit marriages called civil unions pose a serious threat to the health of our culture and while the president may believe this is an issue to be resolved at the state level he should use his moral leadership to steer states away from such culture threatening unions not encourage them by showing indifference or political tolerance
2889690 supporters of v gene robinson the newly consecrated homosexual episcopal bishop claim his elevation sends a powerful message of love and tolerance however it is not tolerant to brush off opposition to the consecration of a homosexual bishop nor is it loving to suppress evidence that homosexual behavior is a death style that is sending young people to an early grave
2889691 o ne of the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the prophets of a new sexual order
2889692 gaining access to children has been a long term goal of the homosexual movement
2889693 violated federal campaign finance laws during congressional elections in 1990 1992 and 1994 and the presidential election in 1992
2889694 equipping our children with the values necessary to stand against liberal education and cultural forces
2889695 i oppose changing the definition of marriage to permit same sex marriages or the granting of special rights on the basis of sexual preference i will strongly defend the rights of organizations like the boy scouts and salvation army to participate fully in american culture free from legal coercion to hire personnel who would undermine the beliefs of such organizations

2889700 but sony is all about ed scott bringing in either one of two former y amp r colleagues of his jack smith or josh griffith who want to get back to writing
2889701 over the past three years i thought i must have been an adopted irishman but our luck has definitely come back
2889702 i had a small problem and had to make a stop to have the crew check out the car
2889703 we came in made some changes and the car was absolutely great when we went back out having done that our strategy was that we basically had to run behind the no 4 corvette and then we could win with a short splash of ethanol at the end
2889704 the car wasnt great at the beginning of the race but everything came to us
2889705 we made adjustments that gave us a good car at the end then unfortunately the no 4 car had a bigger problem than we did
2889706 jan was behind me i was pushing hard and i was trying to make up some time
2889707 i just turned the car in too quickly and got on the inside curb the car shot across to the exit curb and then onto the grass by the time i was on the grass there was no way i could hold it
2889708 im all right but im disappointed with myself for making such a mistake
2889709 the car was loose but we fought through it i think jan liked the setup better than i did and he drove an amazing stint then the way the pit stops played out the race probably would have gone our way in the end
2889710 first we won the race which was great for corvette racing second we proved once again that safety is always paramount at corvette racing it was an unfortunate accident for olly and while the car was damaged the driver emerged unscathed thats a testament to the importance we place on safety
2889711 we provided a great deal of exposure for champ car by displaying their banner prominently on the front of the no 4 corvette after its encounter with the wall in the kink
2889712 he pushed me the whole way and it only came to the bit just before canada corner when i decided that if i was going to go i had to go now
2889713 i think oliver s marathon based training program proved superior to my cabernet and patron tequila based conditioning program
2889714 although i dominated the first two thirds of the race in canada corner i saw olivers wife and three children looking so forlorn at his struggle to keep up that i dropped back and gave him the lead
2889715 the walls are so thin you dont know who is listening
2889716 she managed to turn the family court into one of the top courts in the country
2889717 whats even crazier is the states attorney is actually going to prosecute me in court for this
2889718 theyre sniffing along the grass walking on the grass because thats where the dogs want to walk
2889719 if anything i was more surprised with her conduct to continue to allow her dogs to trespass on this property after she had agreed to cease and desist
2889720 from this point forward she began to constantly walk the dogs in our yard
2889721 i would tell her to get the dogs out of the yard always hearing the same responses it is not your yard stating we are harassing her yelling obscenities giving visual obscenities etc
2889722 the dog walking was is an almost every day event
2889723 okay today were going to play with glitter but its white and sometimes people call it shaving cream
2889724 passages like this make the book her parents recently published about the familys ordeal feel intimate feel like one is sitting with greene in 2002 when she learns there is a 99 percent chance she has leukemia and she futilely clings to the 1 percent chance she does not
2889725 there was nothing wrong with him no physical problems whatsoever
2889726 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
2889727 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected

2889729 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
2889730 you told me more about the process than i know
2889731 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone

2889733 give you goose bumps or make you start to cry
2889734 were finding clear evidence that working on country has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2889735 the health benefits in terms of reducing levels of high blood pressure diabetes and kidney disease are quite striking when people are actively engaged in looking after their country
2889736 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2889737 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2889738 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country
2889739 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity

2889745 di pan ada lembaga untuk memberikan bekal maupun pengetahun kepada artis yang akan maju mengenai masalah politik kebangsaan parlemen di dpr itu seperti apa yang memberikan training itu doktor politik juga politisi yang aktif di partai sekarang anda lihat saja derry drajad kalau tampil di acara republik mimpi itu sudah berbeda karena sudah di training
2889746 bukan sinisme publik tapi sinisme pengamat padahal yang milih kan rakyat jadi kenapa pengamat mengatasnamakan rakyat lha wong rakyat kalau didatangi selebritis senang sekali karena kebetulan banyak koruptor bukan dari artis dede yusuf adjie massaid komar bukan koruptor kan nggak ada artis yang jadi koruptor
2889747 the destruction of businesses that have contributed and continue to contribute to the development of botswana and the disruption of almost 42000 innocent lives due to job losses is most unfortunate and can certainly be avoided we strongly recommend that the introduction of the levy be stayed until the scheduled workshops present to the authorities realistic and proven to work interventions

2889779 just once i would like to see american voters make it clear that candidates will lose if they do get down and dirty then americans would actually have to make their decision for president solely on the basis of the candidates experience skills potential and policies
2889780 so far only one candidate appears interested in having voters choose that option
2889781 now we know edwards is so self absorbed that he would run for president knowing he had a giant skeleton in his closet that would essentially end the election were he the nominee that reflects poorly on him to say the least

2889896 if you read blogs you know that there is this conversation and that some articles are the talk of the day and other posts have important things to say about those
2889897 if you built graphs in your mind of what the talk looks like i think it looks like what ive done i get the sense memeorandum is just a natural representation of what is already going on
2889898 the best way for someone to get into the blogs thing is to find a blog that is tracking an issue important to you because someone new to it can understand the headline and then go read the blog i think my site works pretty well that way
2889899 my dad started using my site a couple weeks later he spotted something he was interested in and now he knows all these bloggers
2889900 the main items can be a journalism piece a blog post or a press release but the discussion is so cool since its like instant editorials which is what most blog posts are memeorandum is much easier than doing a search on the link and for myself and others like robert scoble it has disrupted how we use the web

2889910 the sharp acceleration in producer price inflation seen in recent months is a concern to policymakers as this poses a strong upside risk to cpi consumer price index growth

2889914 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2889915 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2889916 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2889917 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2889921 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2889950 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
2889951 it seems inevitable that the forest will change and some of the native species will lose out
2889952 we know that if birds are not present to fulfill that role there often is nothing else that can do it
2889953 the implications are severe and thats why we consider bird conservation to be so important
2889954 when i go around and give talks it seems like people dont really understand their risk of being the victim of insider sabotage

2889966 they literally charged into the waffle house store in broad daylight
2889967 we were surprised at their brazenness and the level of violence
2889968 weve seen these robberies in the past it appears to be cyclical
