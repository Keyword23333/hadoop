1720001 this could be a symptom of incipient alzheimers in me so i have now taken up crosswords myself unfortunately though i find the cryptic crossword impossible so instead i do g2s quick crossword which is much easier even if it takes most of the day to complete which probably means that i have left it too late

1720018 thats not something that is permitted in the cba its not something we are going to allow and something should they decide to do we will have to manage it the way we would manage any other violation of the collective bargaining agreement
1720019 i think it was a show of unity i think we felt that the cba collective bargaining agreement had been violated in terms of our rights and negotiating with our clubs an extra bonus for this tournament we also felt that it had been set up as if a million dollars was going to the winner and thats not the case we were a little disappointed in the way the tournament had been handled but on the same token its a great tournament and there are great teams in the tournament
1720020 well see how the grievance goes thatll be in the fall well see where we go from there you know i think the fact that we shared the money was to show that were unified as a group it seemed the comments made about the fact that we were splitting the prize showed that the line is drawn in the sand and theres going to be conflict but i think the players are ready for that
1720021 as players were very disappointed and the fact that we werent allowed to negotiate the prize and although were happy with the money at the same time if theyre saying that the mexican teams get twice as much as we do we dont feel thats fair if youre going to add this tournament give us a chance to negotiate prize money thats fair and equal to every team
1720022 we didnt want it to be a situation where were kicking the crap out of each other we know that theres bigger things in this year and if the league are going to add these extra games on at least make it fair for us to have a chance to play for the same thing that the other teams in the tournament are playing for it was a sign of solidarity between both teams and all the mls teams that were in it
1720023 we wanted to make sure that everybody is playing for the rest of the games this season and not getting any injuries in this game where were a little disappointed in the prize money
1720024 every player feels that this tournament is a great tournament and were excited to play in these games and you could see even though were making half of what other teams are making we still fought just as hard
1720025 the interesting thing is that it seems like the players are ready for a fight and why shouldnt they be the revolution and dynamo were put in a position to play five extra games and the prize money they receive really is insufficient compensation for their efforts in the tournament
1720026 in our club we make sure players receive x of the purse from any outside tourney
1720027 i dont know how all of a sudden this became whether through the media or through the player that the only thing that matters in this tournament is the prize money i dont ever hear that in mls i dont hear that in the world cup

1720074 we have always known that children who have undergone trauma best express themselves through the arts painting music writing poetry but we found a new energy and transformation in these kids when we put them onstage and allowed them to tell their own stories
1720075 each of these art forms in and of itself is a form of story telling a child may tell their story by simply writing it out or they may translate it into a verbal picture through poetry or sometimes the visual depiction works best for them through drawing music has been a means of conveying of loss since long before nashville slicked it up and made millions off of it but sometimes the layperson doesnt recognize that people can tell a story also through dramatic expression or dance and those are the kinds of stories we also wanted to tell the physical stories each scene tells the story of children who have suffered emotional trauma and how they find their way in the world and we tell that story through singing acting and dance
1720076 by taking one persons story and creating a song we have already created a new story an interpretation of the original as viewed by another soul taking it another step and adding dance creates yet another story and making it a dramatic representation yet again adds a layer so in creating a scene for a production the children suddenly are privy to the depths of a story from the eyes of several creators and their own creative juices begin to flow from depths they had not yet plumbed
1720077 the title i used to dream comes from the centerpiece song of the show written by carol priour and brought to musical life on the cd by mike cross it tells of the journey from despair to hope which is the same journey we hoped to express with the show itself that kids born into traumatic circumstances still have their whole lives ahead of them to turn to wonderful purpose

1720143 the aba submits that such an appearance of impropriety may be created where as in the present case a judicial officer denies a recusal motion and continues to sit on a case where one of the parties has made significant contributions to the judges election campaign
1720144 it has long been recognized that there is a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators
1720145 due process therefore requires recusal only in those rare cases wherein a judge or justice has a direct personal substantial or pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case
1720146 benjamin created an appearance of bias that would diminish the integrity of the judicial process in the eyes of any reasonable person
1720147 we are obviously pleased that so many distinguished institutions have chosen to speak out about the undue influence of money upon the elected judiciary
1720148 a line needs to be drawn somewhere to prevent a judge from hearing cases involving a person who has made massive campaign contributions to benefit the judge

1720183 it was a senseless crime and had they done something this animal would not have taken my family
1720184 i feel that the government should have stepped in i feel that they allow these immigrants to come in and how dare they strip our families like this
1720185 it should have been resolved at the beginning when this guy had done more than one crime in the city
1720186 i want justice i want the people to see if my family wasnt safe what makes you think yours will be
1720187 weve gone from housing to credit to employment and now i think were going to start to see some negative consumer spending numbers now that were past this fiscal stiumulus program
1720188 there are a lot of opportunities out there in the fixed income market money has to go somewhere to these undervalued sectors within fixed income
1720189 some money will migrate into high yield because unlike most of their other bond brethren high yield bonds tend to thrive on slightly higher inflation
1720190 i cant promise that you wont lose money in high yield or that stocks have reached a bottom but you are better off in high yield than in equities
1720191 previously we said house prices would fall at least 15 percent nationally peak to trough todays challenging economic environment suggests that the housing market is far from stabilizing
1720192 as a result we now believe that national home prices will fall 18 to 20 percent peak to trough the long and short of it is that we now think that we are half way through the overall peak to trough decline
1720193 credit related expenses were far higher than what guidance had been
1720194 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1720195 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1720196 we dont have any negotiations with any large companies at this time
1720197 the volatility has been up 3 down 3 taking all the professionals that you know out whether you were bullish whether you were bearish you were getting stomped on both sides
1720198 i dont think were going to see the end of this volatility for quite some time but i think weve seen the end of the bull market
1720199 i dont think youre going to see crude oil go back above 145 again for quite some period of time

1720202 mit seinem ausscheiden aus der politik erweist kukacka der republik den wohl gr ten dienst in seiner laufbahn als politiker
1720203 es ist ein hohn auf welche absolut entbehrliche art und weise der gr te verkehrspolitische verhinderer der letzten 18 monate und verursacher der total vermurksten bb reform 2003 verkehrsminister faymann anzupatzen versucht
1720204 die anschuldigungen des reformverweigerers kukacka gegen ber dem verkehrsminister entbehren deshalb jeglicher sachlichen grundlage
1720205 kukacka und die vp haben in den vergangenen ber eineinhalb jahren vern nftige weichenstellungen in s mtlichen gremien der bb verhindert und auch durch die sture haltung der vp im parlament war es nicht m glich auch nur die geringste verbesserung in richtung einer vern nftigen reform der gescheiterten bb reform 2003 zu verwirklichen
1720206 und dies sogar um den preis dass in vielen bb bereichen die kompetenzen unklar und somit auch die verantwortlichkeiten verwischt waren auch die unter ex verkehrsstaatssekret r kukacka gef llten personellen entscheidungen sprechen f r sich siehe derivatgesch fte und immobiliendeals
1720207 so ist auch die letzte sitzung des verkehrsausschusses symptomatisch f r die haltung von kukacka und der vp in den letzten 18 monaten gewesen aus dem ministerrat konnten keine entw rfe an den verkehrsauschuss zwecks beschluss von verbesserungen bei den bb weitergeleitet werden im ausschuss hat die vp mit ihrer blockadetaktik dann auch noch alle 12 tagesordnungspunkte vertagt und somit auf eis gelegt
1720208 abgesehen davon kann zur person des vp verkehrssprechers nur noch hinzugef gt werden dass kukacka mit seinem ausscheiden aus der politik der republik den wohl gr ten dienst in seiner laufbahn als politiker erweist
1720209 offenbar hat die vp nun doch noch erkannt wie wichtig und unabdingbar rasche verhandlungen f r eine gesundheitsreform sind um die qualit t der gesundheitsversorgung auch in zukunft zu gew hrleisten und auszubauen
1720210 angesichts aktueller umfragen wonach schon mehr als zwei drittel der sterreicher angeben auswirkungen einer zwei klassen medizin zu sp ren muss den verantwortlichen klar sein dass dringender handlungsbedarf besteht
1720211 die politik ist gefordert daf r zu sorgen dass es auch in zukunft einen freien zugang zu einem solidarisch finanzierten gesundheitsversorgungssystem unabh ngig von der gr e der brieftasche gibt und sich die bev lkerung sicher sein kann dass die beste medizinische versorgung gew hrleistet ist
1720212 spartenobmann schenner zeigt mit dieser aussage sehr viel mehr weitblick als nr gabriel obernosterer der st ndig kritisiert dass der einsatz des eurobudgets der k rnten werbung keinen erfolg gebracht habe k rnten ist als austragungsland der fu ball europameisterschaft im internationalen blickfeld gestanden der werbe und imagewert f r das land sind unbezahlbar
1720213 ich gehe zu 100 prozent mit spartenobmann schenner konform dass diese jahrhundertveranstaltung gewinnbringend f r den sterreichischen tourismus und somit auch f r k rnten ist herr obernosterer soll sich endlich von der ewigen jammerei verabschieden seine kurzsichtigen permanenten schlechtredereien sind f r den k rntner tourismus in keiner weise f rderlich
1720214 die hohe aufmerksamkeit die die euro f r k rnten nach sich gezogen hat werden wir selbstverst ndlich weiter nutzen um unser bundesland noch st rker in den k pfen der potenziellen g ste zu verankern erste erfolge lassen sich bereits in der anfragestatistik f r den juli herauslesen nach sterreichischen deutschen und italienischen g sten liegen die anfragen von g sten aus polen bereits an vierter stelle und haben somit die niederlande berholt
1720215 der anstieg mit 1 430 h henmeter auf 22 kilometer von kematen bei innsbruck bis ins k htai auf das dach der vergangenen deutschlandtouren auf 2020m stellt f r radprofis und hobbysportler eine gro e herausforderung dar

1720286 we are trying to be strong everywhere we are trying to put more on the car but are mindful that we have a massive change in terms of the profile of the aerodynamics for next year so everyone is reaching that dilemma i think between ourselves renault and red bull it is partly track dependent and the question will be who can put the most on in the last few weeks before we have to start on next years car without stop

1720293 when you travel the byroads of central russia you begin to understand the secret of the pacifying russian countryside it is in the churches they lift their bell towers graceful shapely all different high over mundane timber and thatch from villages that are cut off and invisible to each other they soar to the same heaven t he evening chimes used to ring out floating over the villages fields and woods reminding men that they must abandon trivial concerns of this world and give time and thought to eternity

1720298 people make a judgment about you in the first five seconds after they meet you
1720299 and they are making a judgment about who you are
1720300 where do you want to be three years from now where do you want to be professionally where do you want to be socially
1720301 the first thing you need to do is find out what the fashion culture is where you are going
1720302 in italy you could probably interview in a paprika suit if thats a color that works for you i wouldnt recommend that in japan theyre not fashion forward in the business world
1720303 you need to consider whether you can wear open toed shoes sleeveless shirts or shorts to work thats your responsibility as a person going from one country to another
1720304 we had to consider that she was a female doing business in the middle east
1720305 coming to work in a short skirt would not be looked upon well
1720306 alterations and tailoring have a lot to do with how an article looks on you
1720307 its better to buy a size too big than a size too small the worst that could happen is people will think you lost weight
1720308 as americans i think we need to respect the people and places we visit you need to remember that you are a guest its not just the fashion part of it but the intellectual part as well you can have the right outfit on but if you dont have the right attitude it isnt going to work
1720309 americans think white socks are acceptable that is a big mistake youll see educated powerful people wearing white socks they should know better
1720310 one major faux pas is to be caught in a time warp wearing clothes that are totally outdated for women this would mean frosted blue eye shadow or bright red lipstick

1720322 ik ben heel trots op deze unieke prestatie het is zeldzaam dat drie programmas van n commerci le zen der meedingen naar zon belangrijke internationale prijs
1720323 vooral in amerika was er veel belangstelling voor de uitzending peter was naar aanleiding hiervan te gast bij diversen grote amerikaanse talkshows en nieuwsprogrammas
1720324 het onderwerp leidde nog voor uitzending tot veel beroering in de media

1720329 and thats the order in which were going to do it
1720330 the show is a twist on the standard jazz format
1720331 we had a great chemistry in the first film and really good friendship
1720332 as much as we could we stayed in touch in the three years between the two movies im particularly close with amber because on the campaign trail together for hilary clinton we all like to keep in touch because we like each others company
1720333 at the core carmen is dealing with the same issues she was dealing with in the first movie which is her issues with abandonment
1720334 in the first movie her father is moving on without her and this time around its her friends are moving on in an easier way than she is and her mother is remarried and pregnant
1720335 so again her world is moving on without her when shes quite happy with the way things are
1720336 shes upset about being abandoned by her friends and her mother and shes stuck in her shell until she realizes that its time to move on before she becomes an unhappy person
1720337 i was really interested in this notion of how friendships evolve in the first movie the friendships were really sweet and a lot of the conflict came from each of the girls individual lives and stories there wasnt a lot of conflict within the friendship
1720338 what i was excited about this time around was the focus of the friendship and how it was changing with my character and ambers character tibby theyre both so lost in their own struggles that they cant be there for each other i liked that the friendship was getting more complicated
1720339 i think in terms of would i have needed to see this when i was a kid the idea is a little bit selfish to be frank
1720340 but when salma hayek came to me with the idea ugly betty i thought to myself god this is the kind of show i would want to watch if i was a girl sitting at home or even now when it comes to sisterhood and when i read those books and was such a huge fan theses are stories i want to watch as movies
1720341 i pick things that way because im a young woman looking for inspiration
1720342 i think that resounds with other women who feel similarly
1720343 we are very disappointed that iran has yet again failed to give javier solana a clear answer to the generous incentives package
1720344 we agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1720345 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran the six countries are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another resolution
1720346 the letter that we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1720347 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1720348 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict
1720349 people say that what we are seeking is a meaning for life i dont think thats what were really seeking i think that what were seeking is an experience of being alive so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive
1720350 pare down belongings to only those necessary things you need a sofa but what about all those throw cushions similarly says jane having two sets of china and three sets of glassware eats up time taking care of them
1720351 everything i bring into my house must fulfill more than one function
1720352 i believe we need to pare down to seek out what is essential and good to look at
1720353 have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful
1720354 it makes me mad that people keep comparing me to amy winehouse its just labeling me as something else without any respect for the struggle the determination focus or artistic vision i have
1720355 its like whoa whats that about why would i want to be someone else because i really dont i just want to be me
1720356 this was from the age when phil collins would take a bathroom break and come out with a gold record this aired on local chicago tv without mercy on sunday november 16th 1986
1720357 the moment one gives close attention to anything even a blade of grass it becomes a mysterious awesome indescribably magnificent world in itself
1720358 this is probably one of the most thorough and detailed looks anyone has done for this website your ability to channel the user and get into their heads is scary in the really good way of course
1720359 your report is the best money ive ever spent on the internet
1720360 i think if and when we do wed probably announce it after the fact as opposed to making any big announcement
1720361 i couldnt just go to some bar and walk in and ask someone out on a date if i had any regret it would be that strange lack of anonymity that created panic within myself that i would be found out
1720362 i am satisfied that we managed to improve the result despite a drop in sales
1720363 we think they wouldnt choose to file but there is a risk they could be overwhelmed by the events
1720364 fixing their product mix and cutting their staff down to manageable levels is going to take a fair amount of time to work down to the bottom line
1720365 if they continue to lose money at the current rate their chances of bankruptcy are uncomfortably high
1720366 gm looks like they have four or five quarters to get their act together
1720367 they may not be running the business well but theyre still selling a lot of cars
1720368 its not buggy whips its a real business i dont think any of them are going away
1720369 oh jeez maybe its not too small of a car for me and i should go buy one right now

1720372 my understanding is that fans will be issued with a coloured tag to wear around their neck or on their clothing
1720373 this is to identify them as being part of an organised group if they do misbehave then they can be pointed out and easily identified as being part of an organised group
1720374 stena line will be introducing coloured lanyards to football clubs when they travel
1720375 these lanyards will only be colour specific and will not identify individuals nor will they reveal which supporters club they are from
1720376 for the first time to replace short term anxiety with longer term certainty
1720377 victims groups who are grant dependent and therefore wonder every year whether the money is going to come through whether they will be able to afford to keep their staff
1720378 there is no issue more sensitive or difficult to deal with for the executive than that of how to address the needs of victims and survivors
1720379 we hope that this document will help to move us on the road to making a real difference to the lives of those who have been most affected by the events here over the last 40 years
1720380 the executive set aside 36m to meet the needs of victims and survivors over the next three years however we want to ensure that future support and services are shaped by victims and survivors
1720381 this is a fantastic project which challenges students to work as a team and to put the skills taught in lectures into practice
1720382 we also have to present the car as a business with full cost analysis which looks very good on your cv if you are pursuing a career in motor sport
1720383 in addition it opens the door for other career opportunities in the engineering industry
1720384 the interaction and support between industry and academia is now more important than ever
1720385 politics like life in general is unpredictable when you will have opportunities like this present themselves
1720386 the voter turnout really hurt me i gave it my best but being outspent 20 to 1 was hard to overcome
1720387 con todo mi afecto y admiraci n hacia los ciudadanos de pontevedra ciudad de la que tan buenos recuerdos guardo en mi memoria
1720388 no queremos ser una lista m s queremos llegar al poder
1720389 hemos tenido varios problemas para conformar la lista de los candidatos porque de varias regiones nos llegaron muy tarde porque t sabes estamos en chile
1720390 con el pacto de omisi n donde nosotros no presentamos candidatos en curic y en otras comunas para favorecer al candidato de la concertaci n
1720391 a veces hago las cosas que me gustan hacer otras veces las que tengo que hacer
1720392 our goal is to provide a secure environment so the iraqi government can take control and we can transition home
1720393 it is encouraging to see them take care of their people
1720394 i dont remember it being hot like this back when i was a kid
1720395 well pollution is bad but since its not causing global warming we shouldnt do anything about it
1720396 the economic situation had an affect on the business the whole travel business is in for a rough time
1720397 if you need to transmit a signed document scan and email it instead of printing and faxing it
1720398 and dont just recycle close the loop by buying recycled content office products
1720399 if youre buying new office equipment look for products with the energy star label theyre designed to save a lot more energy than products without the label
1720400 they use 75 less energy and last 8 to 10 years
1720401 reusing furniture is a lot easier on the planet than buying new

1720403 f r e e that spells free creditreport com baby saw their ads on my tv thought about going but was too lazy
1720404 c a l cu lus a p hardest class in history
1720405 were just trying to do something thats talked about and seen and gets passed around in pop culture
1720406 we knew our creative was good and we were targeting a younger audience
1720407 thats exactly what weve received with that we have a lot younger demographic coming into our site
1720408 theres a lot of elements i think that help the campaign work as a whole
1720409 its not just a catchy song the performances of the actors are great and really the characters of the singer and the band i think a lot of people identify with him hes a bit of a lovable loser
1720410 its what i call a protection racket the companies are charging you a fee and theyre making a promise that its going to improve your credit and protect against identity theft but in fact it does neither
1720411 the sites are designed to trick people into taking on overpriced useless credit monitoring and they do so by attempting to make it appear as if youre going to get something for free
1720412 in some cases the free product comes with strings attached
1720413 its not the one by the government which is why we put the link on our front page of the landing site and it is a free report its really a test drive for people to understand whats in that report because a report can be very complex
1720414 i think its just a shabby way to market anything
1720415 i dont think theyve cracked down hard enough on the television and other kinds of radio ads that are deceptive to consumers because theres no room to put adequate disclosure
1720416 unfortunately i think the offer is purposefully designed to make it easy for you to get your credit report and then forget that youve just signed up for an in perpetuity fee
1720417 get your free credit report and whatever its still only the experian score
1720418 patriotism is putting the country first before party or personal ambition before anything
1720419 every preference of a small good to a great or a partial good to a total good involves the loss of the small or partial good for which the sacrifice was made
1720420 its a tough loss but im proud the way this ballclub played nine innings
1720421 at times he wants to carry the puck and his decision making sometimes is a little bit questionable and thats why his plus minus is where it is

1720426 bring back brett distracted them during practice on tuesday well before that the constant media questions were wearing thin on them
1720427 its time for it to be over cornerback charles woodson said
1720428 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us woodson said
1720429 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1720430 nay came tuesday evening when packers coach mike mccarthy told reporters that after extensive conversations with favre over the past two days he has determined that favre doesnt have the right mindset to play for the packers
1720431 its to the point now man were tired of it here in the locker room just hearing about it cornerback al harris said
1720432 hopefully they get something done upstairs and they can answer these questions instead of the questions coming to us
1720433 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008 mccarthy said
1720434 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1720435 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it
1720436 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1720437 brutally honest conversations with favre over the past two days mccarthy said favre couldnt seem to get past emotional wounds that were opened as tensions mounted in recent weeks even with the chance to win his starting job back potentially on the table
1720438 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want mccarthy said
1720439 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1720440 thats part of the issue with him quite frankly mccarthy said
1720441 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1720442 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional mccarthy said
1720443 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1720444 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way mccarthy said
1720445 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1720446 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests
1720447 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1720448 its part of the game experience for people to come and tailgate but its also something that was meant for people who have tickets to the game
1720449 along with the rest of the nfl we are proactively making the best possible game day experience for our fans
1720450 it is not living that is important but living rightly
1720451 the food situation is deteriorating and the number of children admitted in the special centres for malnutrition cases has doubled in the last three months
1720452 these supplies will support their immediate food needs the seeds will help the people to be self sufficient as they prepare for the next planting season
1720453 nkunda is still recruiting and training people contrary to the goma peace accord
1720454 the issue of the planes is a false allegation the army has not yet taken any decision or step despite the movements and recruitments within the cndp camps
1720455 at the moment monuc does not have information on the movements but we have information on the recruitments and other violations of the ceasefire accord

1720457 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1720458 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1720459 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1720460 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1720461 its so shocking being an american to see the blatant oppression
1720462 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1720463 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1720464 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1720465 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand
1720466 no where in the world except during the nazi regime and bosnian war do soldiers destroy whole villages because of the sins of a few men
1720467 the operation lacked tactics and professionalism resembling that of drunken bulls on a rampage
1720468 none of the victims received any form of emergency medical service for the trauma and many simply bled to death
1720469 while mend will not support criminality we will advise the jtf to investigate and plan properly before going for an arrest by simply watching dallas swat on television they can learn a lot that raids are narrowed to one house and not the entire neighbourhood
1720470 well we read about the ultimatum today and we have not taken a decision to leave the fct however we shall reply to the ultimatum in a statement which we shall make available to all the media houses
1720471 if julius berger could decide to pull out of the niger delta region because of the alleged disturbances by the youths one expected that such decision should be taken with the recent happening in abuja
1720472 i keep saying im not sure if this is true or not true im making the team and now im the first guy coming to the stadium and the whole world will be watching me carry the flag there are no words to describe it
1720473 in america everyone has a chance to do all these things
1720474 you follow the rules people will choose and if im blessed to get that opportunity ill get it
1720475 i feel happy honored im feeling so blessed to get an opportunity to present the united states of america to present the united states flag in front of my team
1720476 i was sitting next to jerry colangelo and said you know weve waited three years to get off this plane and do this
1720477 i think were prepared and while were here we need to prepare more
1720478 its a little overwhelming that its really here the reality that were here
1720479 weve been treated with the greatest amount of respect and friendliness we could not have been treated better i know well get the same treatment in beijing the chinese people love basketball and were excited were playing the first game against china
1720480 i try to see american players every time they come to china but this time is the most special because of the olympics
1720481 a once in a lifetime opportunity and they should experience all those things
1720482 i hope to get my team ready to perform at the highest level to win a gold medal thats my only desire here and ill be ok with that

1720486 our clients understand that you have received custody of the dog in good faith however in law neither northumbria police nor the dog shelter had the legal authority or good title to pass tango on to you
1720487 we had the dog for seven months and if it was stolen property why didnt they come down prove it was stolen and take the dog away not leave the dog to get bonded with somebody for seven months
1720488 i showed the paperwork to our mp ronnie campbell and he said it was our dog legally
1720489 i went to north shields police to get more information after we were told someone was claiming it and i was told a girl took it in there and told the police she had found it wandering north shields
1720490 the police took it off her as a stray the police officer said the dog was legally ours and we had the proper paperwork and everything
1720491 the dog was handed in to the police on january 10
1720492 we collected it and brought it back to benton and scanned it for a microchip and it didnt have one
1720493 there was no collar we held it for seven days to see if the owner came forward and nobody did
1720494 it was put up for rehoming as was the standard procedure with police stray dogs on january 18
1720495 on january 19 a couple visited the shelter and adopted the dog on january 21 a man called the shelter asking for his dog back saying he had been on holiday for six weeks and it was a stud dog which lived on his premises in his stable yard
1720496 it was a further week later that he reported it stolen it is an extremely rare case and it hasnt happened before in the three years that i have been here
1720497 we were sitting on deckchairs at the very back of the seated area and we got up to have a bit of a dance
1720498 being at the back we werent in anyones way and the only people behind us was the standing audience
1720499 we were having a great time until a steward came over and told us to sit down we asked why and she just said it was the rules and dancing wasnt allowed
1720500 we saw other stewards walking around telling other people to sit down as well it really spoiled the atmosphere
1720501 our free summer festival attracts thousands of visitors and residents each year
1720502 the bents park concerts are particularly popular and the hard work we put into preparations is geared towards enabling everybody to enjoy themselves
1720503 in addition to the main standing area in bents park we also provide an enclosed seating only area in front of the main stage
1720504 the seating area was created in response to complaints from people who were arriving early to sit in front of the stage only for other people to come in once the show had started and stand in front of them throughout the performance
1720505 the seating area is popular with people of all ages but is particularly well used by the elderly and people with disabilities
1720506 dancing is allowed in the seating area we only ask that people give consideration to other spectators when doing so

1720543 it seems a little ridiculous i would have never expected this of all places to be where people would come and rummage through and take whatever they want for their personal gain
1720544 its no different from people always accusing government of spending money for certain items heres a case where people are taking money from the government
1720545 it bothers me more that theyre taking away finances from the educational system than the fact theyre just stealing

1720581 we hebben onze ambassade in peking ingeschakeld om diplomatieke stappen te nemen en hopen dat de chinezen op hun besluit terugkomen
1720582 de chinese equipe is extreem sterk en behoort in nagenoeg alle disciplines tot de kanshebbers op goud
1720583 het wordt waarschijnlijk een strijd tussen drie landen met china als favoriet gevolgd door rusland en ons
1720584 de kenners denken dat china de meeste gouden medailles gaat winnen ik doe geen voorspellingen of wij dan tweede of derde worden
1720585 het lijkt erop dat respect en moraal ajax hebben verlaten sinds marco van basten aan het roer staat

1720613 when he refused i used my paintball gun and chased the seals it stings their hides so they stay away
1720614 they probably thought i was killing the seals but it is the only way to keep them away
1720615 if it turned round and bit someone marine and coastal management would be held responsible

1720617 the potential for dedifferentiation of all the different cells that make up the islets of langerhans is a totally new finding at this stage we cant confirm whether the cells ability to turn into stem like cells occur naturally in a healthy pancreas but the results are very encouraging for the development of regenerative therapies to fight diabetes
1720618 we know that the peptide works but we are still lacking certain theoretical bases to explain its mechanism this finding will allow us to move ahead on firmer ground
1720619 if we knew what we were doing it wouldnt be called research now would it

1720621 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1720622 marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1720623 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1720624 xstratas offer reflects the operational weakness that lonmin has seen which has made lonmin vulnerable
1720625 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly
1720626 xstrata is easily big enough they can afford to buy lonmin certainly
1720627 this new innovation is useless as all you get to see with the enhancement is the batter

1720639 theres a set of tools called edge that were developed on the naughty dog premises actually by a group of very very senior games programmer some from naughty dog and some from elsewhere i think its tremendously visionary of sony to make these tools which are largely low level libraries
1720640 its code that runs on spus and its to do with things like animation compression generalised compression and rendering optimisations these guys are really old school programmers guys who are always looking to shave another cycle off an operation and part of the skill of developing for the playstation 3 is getting the gpu to farm jobs out to the six spus seeing which spus are idling and can take up some of the slack in a frame to frame kind of way
1720641 thats why we think were probably only using 30 or 40 per cent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential all third party developers can get the edge libraries for free and are going to be able to use them in their own ways to get more and more and more out of the ps3 over the years
1720642 we have this culture of open communication we like to trade stories about what we found were ways of doing things that worked and what didnt were always trading war stories with insomniac and evolution and sucker punch were just one block away from sony santa monica the guys who made god of war and we get our designers together with theirs for formal lunches and just talk about tools design approaches and so on so theres this town square feeling of everybody trading stories about our best practices and i think it makes everybody stronger and smarter
1720643 naughty dog edge tools make ps3 games better than xbox 360 games

1720650 african american adolescent females seeking treatment for stds are at high risk for hiv however no interventions have demonstrated efficacy in reducing hiv associated sexual behaviors among this vulnerable subgroup
1720651 we found that gender tailored and culturally congruent interventions can reduce bacterial std infections and enhance hiv preventive behaviors
1720652 our findings suggest that the effectiveness of hiv interventions was adversely affected by alcohol use
1720653 to develop more effective hiv interventions for alcohol using adolescent females requires also directly addressing the important role of alcohol use
1720654 we have seen first hand what the lack of tummy time can mean for a baby developmental cognitive and organizational skills delays eye tracking problems and behavioral issues to name just some complications
1720655 new parents are told of the importance of babies sleeping on their backs to avoid sids but they are not always informed about the importance of tummy time
1720656 ideally babies should be placed on their tummies after every nap diaper change and feeding starting with 1 2 minutes
1720657 since the early 1990s we have seen a significant decrease in sids cases while simultaneously witnessing an alarming increase in skull deformation
1720658 increasing the amount of time your baby lies on his or her tummy promotes muscle development in the neck and shoulders helps prevent tight neck muscles and the development of flat areas on the back of the babys head and helps build the muscles baby needs to roll sit and crawl
1720659 its important to get our infants out of devices that constrain mobility and onto their tummies so they can focus on neck muscle balance as they interact with their caregivers

1720698 we are in contact with the colombian authorities to ask for further clarifications as to exactly what happened
1720699 reveals that a member of the army team involved was wearing a tabard marked with the red cross emblem before the operation had even begun suggesting intentional misuse
1720700 if authenticated these images would clearly establish an improper use of the red cross emblem which we deplore
1720701 this officer upon confessing his mistake to his superiors said when the rescue helicopter was about to land he saw so many guerrillas that he went into a state of angst
1720702 he feared for his life and put on the red cross bib over his jacket
1720703 red cross red crescent and red crystal emblems is governed by the geneva conventions and their additional protocols
1720704 these emblems may not be used by bodies or persons not entitled to do so under international humanitarian law
1720705 if you use the emblem in a deceitful way generally the conventions say it would be a breach based on the information as explained to me the way that the images show the red cross emblem being used could be distinguished as a war crime
1720706 complete and total respect for the red cross emblem is essential if the icrc is to be able to bring assistance and protection to the people worst affected by armed conflicts and other situations of violence
1720707 as a neutral and impartial humanitarian organization the icrc depends on the trust of all the parties to the conflict to be able to carry out its humanitarian work
1720708 hamdan is now considered a convicted war criminal and is no longer considered an enemy combatant and will be held separately from the other detainees at guantanamo because of his new status

1720717 i agree with the american automobile association we should all inflate our tires
1720718 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1720719 we need to have a thorough outside investigation to understand what is happening and to take the appropriate steps to correct the situation
1720720 the community is outraged and its not only in inglewood
1720721 he was my first grandson and a fine young man he worked at the post office for 19 years and wanted to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather
1720722 the government on a whim put out these 26 laws smuggling in the night a group of measures that the venezuelan people clearly said no to
1720723 basically the state is defining what the venezuelan consumer should eat how much to eat and where to acquire the brand of their preference
1720724 we were never properly consulted on the staffing agreement where is the democracy a lot of council members did not see the details of this agreement
1720725 when you are working with the private sector it is very different from the public sector right from the beginning we had to set up some sort of confidentiality protocol and we invited unison to sign this but they refused
1720726 because we could not be seen to share information given to us in confidence by the private sector we have done the best that we could at the earliest possibility
1720727 there would be posts lost because the savings that have to be made are large
1720728 is the election all about obama i dont know but i do know that a faulty story line in the way the election is covered for the next three months wont help either of the candidates run a better campaign or voters understand whats really happening is it too late to change the script

1720742 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement
1720743 was inspired by partisan divisions inside the broadcasting board of governors

1720753 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
1720754 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
1720755 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

1720769 it is commonly believed that successful coping with a traumatic event requires expressing ones thoughts and feelings about the experience suggesting that people who choose not to do so would be at high risk for poor adjustment contrary to common belief participants who chose not to express any initial reaction reported better outcomes over time than did those who expressed an initial reaction among those who chose to express their immediate reactions longer responses predicted worse outcomes over time
1720770 in the immediate aftermath of a collective trauma its perfectly healthy to not want to express your thoughts and feelings
1720771 some people have periods of what psychologists call healthy denial like scarlet ohara they cope by promising themselves to think about it tomorrow being pushed to give voice to their worst reactions too soon could embed the worst of it in memory and cause them to dwell on the tragedy
1720772 who dwell on personal concerns with friends such as whether jason likes them or why they werent invited to taylors party are likely to be anxious and depressed in a study of more than 800 students in third fifth seventh and ninth grades girls and boys who rehashed problems and focused on negative feelings developed close friendships with co complainers but the girls not the boys ended up depressed and anxious which led to more angst y chatter an endless cycle
1720773 for girls a reciprocal relationship was found in which co rumination predicted increased depressive and anxiety symptoms and increased positive friendship quality over time which in turn contributed to greater co rumination

1720789 i believe his intent throughout has been that of a highly professional public safety official and nothing in my review of the case has led me to question his motivation
1720790 this situation pointed out the need for additional procedures and agreements to address this type of unusual circumstance
1720791 with all due respect i do not find your interpretation of events very reassuring
1720792 this investigation continued well beyond the point where you can blame a misunderstanding or legal glitch
1720793 why hasnt this information been previously mentioned and already provided
1720794 the police auditor had nothing to do with the complaint
1720795 there was no other way for her to classify it
1720796 did not want to create more conflict where it wasnt necessary
1720797 while the city manager would like to characterize my framing of the issue as not being black and white there really is no gray area
1720798 this sounds like a reasonable way to deal with an issue like this
1720799 i think what the public wants us to do is get this settled and move forward
1720800 my two objectives all along have been to preserve this piece of the amazon creek head waters property for future generations and to do so while honoring the voters intent for all the uses of the parks bond funds
1720801 this acquisition achieves both of those purposes i greatly appreciate the ad hoc advisory committee for helping to clarify the issues and also the staffs work as good stewards of public resources in successfully negotiating this purchase
1720802 it puts this issue to rest gets us the property and we are not completely draining all of the money out of the parks bond measure that we passed two years ago
1720803 i have no problem with the 500 000 coming from the bond measure because that is money that is supposed to be used for acquiring open space
1720804 he gets out of the car and she sees him putting his little costume on carrying a bag

1720813 ibm has been investing in enterprise linux from the beginning
1720814 and we have this humongous portfolio of software available to support it but as we have watched linux mature weve seen a couple of areas that are on the brink of opening up opportunities for us for customers for partners and for the industry
1720815 weve long believed that one of the best ways to deliver technology to this market is through what is popularly known as an appliance
1720816 opens new opportunities for domino software vendors to deliver their applications on a software appliance to the smallest businesses
1720817 until now there really hasnt been a good integrated enterprise ready choice for small business besides this microsoft offering
1720818 we believe it will present a compelling alternative and bring openness to the world of small business which hasnt been historically true

1720878 der durchschnittliche kunde hat einfach keine lust seine bank anzurufen oder seinem online h ndler eine e mail zu schicken wenn eine von ihm in anspruch genommene sachleistung weiterer erkl rungen bedarf oder defizite aufweist stattdessen sollte alles von anfang an klar strukturiert und problemlos verlaufen
1720879 die these von bill price ist verlockend und einleuchtend zugleich kunden wollen keinen service sondern selbsterkl rende und zuverl ssige produkte die m glichst den servicefall ausschlie en bzw mit schnell und einfach zu bedienenden self service angeboten kombiniert sind
1720880 sie schlagen sich anscheinend lieber in ihre kundendienst abteilungen mit den auswirkungen und symptomen schlecht konzipierter produkte und services herum und bet tigen sich in der brandbek mpfung ohne die ursachen wirklich zu beheben
1720881 insbesondere bei den festnetzanbietern bekommt man zuweilen den eindruck dass sie alles tun um m glichst viele servicevorf lle zu generieren
1720882 all das f hrt schnell zu kundenfrust mitarbeiter sind oftmals nicht in der lage ein problem am telefon zu l sen da sie lediglich f r einfache ausk nfte die so genannten faqs geschult sind und ber keine oder geringe vollmachten verf gen um ein kundenanliegen schnell und unb rokratisch zu l sen
1720883 diese mehrfach kontakte der von price zitierte schneeballeffekt werden dann zum echten problem wenn anfragen ber unterschiedliche eingangskan le nicht einem vorgang zugeordnet werden k nnen diese f higkeit besitzen leider die wenigsten unternehmen zudem gibt es oftmals keine ad quate m glichkeit einfache vorg nge schnell selbst zu erledigen wer es gewohnt ist seine fl ge online zubuchen den telefonischen quick check in bevorzugt und sitzplatzreservieren per sms liebt der hat wenig spa bei den meisten angeboten der telefonfirmen zur selbstadministration per telefon oder im internet
1720884 es spricht einiges daf r dass hnlich wie bei den fluggesellschaften gut gemachte self service angebote auch angenommen werden die anzahl der kundenanfragen sinkt und damit die kunden zufriedenheit steigt
1720885 alles andere l uft ber maschinen besser es dauert nicht mehr lange dann k nnen automaten auf die stimmungslage des benutzers reagieren einen griesgram mit humor freundlich stimmen den gestressten z gig bedienen und den ratsuchenden mit ausf hrlichen und genauen informationen versorgen muffelnde call center agenten d mmliche beratung von der stange b rokratische organisationen berflutete wartezimmer beim onkel doktor terminschlampereien von kfz betrieben warteschleifen am telefon oder genervtes verkaufspersonal kann sich niemand mehr leisten
1720886 wir m ssen die self service intelligenz viel st rker im kundenservice verankern vor allen dingen im call center
1720887 die absichten hintergr nde und der leidensdruck des kunden m ssen antizipiert werden
1720888 der durchschnittliche kunde hat einfach keine lust seine bank anzurufen oder seinem online h ndler eine e mail zu schicken wenn eine von ihm in anspruch genommene sachleistung weiterer erkl rungen bedarf oder defizite aufweist stattdessen sollte alles von anfang an klar strukturiert und problemlos verlaufen
1720889 hier liegt ganz offensichtlich eine klaffende diskrepanz vor um diese schieflage zu beseitigen m ssen wir alles daran setzen die kundenkontakt frequenz dahingehend einzuschr nken dass ineffiziente kontakte von vornherein vermieden werden daf r sollten wir proaktive selbstbedienungs services anbieten und erst dann wenn dinge au er kontrolle geraten ist es unsere aufgabe den kunden durch einen perfekt funktionierenden kundenservice zu einer uneingeschr nkt positiven erfahrung zu verhelfen
1720890 einige unternehmen scheinen es einfach nicht begreifen zu wollen wie viel geld und kunden wohlwollen sie durch ihr verhalten aufs spiel setzen und anstatt sich auf den ausbau des optimalen kundenservices zu konzentrieren lassen sie sich durch ineffiziente kontrollinstrumente und prozesse fehlleiten die meisten firmen sind unf hig ihren service entsprechend der kundenbed rfnisse neu auszurichten und zu optimieren sie lassen alles schleifen korrigieren reaktiv nur das notwendigste und zwar dann wenn ein problem auftritt anstatt an der basis grundlegende ver nderungen durchzuf hren und von diesen indifferenten mir doch egal unternehmen gibt es so einige vor allem dort wo kurzfristige rentabilit tsmotive dominieren oder wo eine techniklastige kultur vorherrscht
1720891 die unternehmen glauben dass sie dadurch bessere und hochwertigere produkte herstellen w hrend eine gro e anzahl der kunden produkte und dienstleistungen pr feriert die einfach und unkompliziert in der anwendung sind wie beispielsweise iphone von apple oder amazons 1 click
1720892 mache es deinen kunden leicht und unkompliziert dich zu kontaktieren
1720893 h re genau auf die kundenanfragen und w nsche und agiere sofort

1720904 erfolgreiches kundenmanagement bedeutet daher zum zeitpunkt der kontaktaufnahme des kunden oder vice versa die richtigen dinge tun zu k nnen und die interaktionen intelligent zu steuern
1720905 brav der beziehungsthese folgend haben unternehmen m chtige datenbanken aufgebaut und speichern darin informationen ber den kunden was er wann und wo gekauft hat ob und wie oft er sich beklagt hat und was mit der beschwerde passiert ist um einen durchblick in diesem datendickicht zu bekommen stellen diese firmen ausufernde analysen an wer sind die guten kunden wer die schlechten k ufer was darauf folgt sind teure massen mailings umfangreiche nervt tende abendliche call center attacken sowie streuverlustbehaftete werbema nahmen
1720906 was n tzt das r ckw rtsgewandte beziehungsmanagement wenn zum zeitpunkt des kundenkontaktes alle vor schreck den f ller fallen lassen weil sie nicht wissen was sie ihm verkaufen sollen und nicht verstehen wie cross und up selling funktionieren

1720918 ich habe schon vor langer zeit als ich bei bell labs damals gearbeitet habe und sozusagen direkt neben den leuten sa die spracherkennung gebaut haben von hidden markow modells geh rt und diesen dingen damals wurde schon gel stert die spracherkennung ist der bereich der jedes jahr die erkennungsgenauigkeit von 94 auf 97 prozent steigert das ist nicht wirklich anders geworden wenn das wordspotting langsam unabh ngiger wird von den sprechern und damit das training wegf llt oder das training so passiert dass die leute berhaupt nicht merken dass sie die ger te trainieren und hnliche fortschritte dann wird es einen triggerpunkt geben ab dem die gro e verbreitung einsetzt obwohl es vorher den eindruck gab als w rde das nur ganz m hsam vorankommen

1720951 from muhammad ibn abd al wahhab to his brother in faith abd al rahman ibn abdalla peace be upon you and also the mercy and the blessings of allah to continue i am pleased to receive your letter may allah make you one of the leaders of the pious people and also one of the missionaries calling people to the religion of the chief of the messengers i would like to inform you that i am by the grace of allah a follower of the pure religion and not a mubtadi innovator my creed and religion with which i obey allah is the same madhab as that of the ahl al sunnah wal jamaah and as that held by the leaders of the muslims such as the four celebrated leaders of law and their followers till the day of resurrection however i have laid emphasis on faithfulness and sincerity in following the religion of allah i have asked the people not to invoke the living and the dead from among the saintly and pious people seeking help i have also advised them to avoid committing acts of shirk associating other objects in the worship of allah while offering devotion to allah in such matters like slaughtering for sacrifice making vows trusting in anyone or in sujood prostration and such other matters which are exclusively reserved for allah alone none is to be taken as a partner unto allah may he be an angel or a prophet commissioned by him it is he alone that all the messengers from the first to the last were ordered to obey and worship this is the madhab followed by the ahl al sunnah wal jamaah i have also told the people in clear words that the first and the earliest of people who introduced acts of shirk were the rafidah shia extremists who invoked ali and others seeking help for their needs and to rid them of their afflictions i hold an office in my town where people listen to me and obey me this was disliked by some of the chief magnates of the town as what i said was against their traditions i lead the people in the stipulated prayers and induce them to pay their zakat and to perform other acts of devotion to allah i forbade them to indulge in riba in drinking wine and all other intoxicants the people opposed these corrupt leaders and rose against them this is the thawheed i have been commanded to preach these mischievous magnates of the town began to ascribe different kinds of fabrications to me the mischief flared up and they attacked us with all the armies of satan the cavalry and the infantry they allege that i branded all the people as kaafirs except those who follow me and that i have solemnized their marriages in a wrong and illegal manner i wonder how a sane man can think of and say such silly things i however declare myself free from such calumnies in the presence of allah such talks can only emanate from the mentally deranged in short whatsoever is mentioned about me except that i invite them to thawheed and prohibit them from committing acts of shirk is absolutely false

1720956 republican voter richard gilbert last year challenged the eligibility of several students at historically black elizabeth city state university to vote in a municipal election the local elections board dismissed gilberts complaint that students are only temporary residents in the town of about 20 000 people
1720957 similar fights over voter qualifications will be waged this year particularly in southern states as democrat barack obamas drive to register hundreds of thousands of new black voters clashes with republican suspicions that get out the vote efforts recruit people who arent eligible to cast ballots if the democrats are to have any chance at all of carrying this state it will only be because of a much larger than normal and completely united black vote said david rohde a political science professor at duke university in durham
1720958 chicago lawyer mazen asbahi who was appointed volunteer national coordinator for muslim american affairs by the obama campaign on july 26 stepped down monday after an internet newsletter wrote about his brief stint on the funds board which also included a fundamentalist imam
1720959 t he compromise obama voted for was supported by most senate democrats and lacked many of the administrations original proposals as weve said before it resulted in a small net tax increase on oil companies
1720960 obama rarely talks about his year spent within the arcane sphere of global finance as a junior editor for business international corp a publisher based in new york but in the years since obama has demonstrated an economic worldview bearing some common priorities with the first company for which he worked at some points in his legislative career and presidential campaign obama demonstrated a willingness to let markets run their course when some other democrats had sought a more forceful government hand he rejects mandates for adults to buy health insurance and encourages the expansion of global exchanges for carbon emissions credits he has helped make it easier for private companies to take over public housing projects
1720961 those who worked at business international say obamas brief account contains inaccuracies or misrepresentations about the company obama has acknowledged fictionalizing narrative elements in the book they say that while offering consulting functions to clients business international was far more a publishing house than a consulting firm
1720962 according to these members of generation y obama 47 has the cool thing down hes an avid basketball player listens to jay z on his ipod and was on the cover of this months issue of rolling stone magazine mccain on the other hand has admitted hes a big fan of the 70s era swedish disco band abba and an illiterate when it comes to using a computer he turns 72 next month and if elected hed be the oldest president in american history to begin his first term
1720963 i am glad obama hit that journalist in the head most journalists have been serving as proxy for john mccain they dont question john on his bogus policies but act as surrogate
1720964 obama has described nuclear power as not optimal and labeled himself not a nuclear energy proponent
1720965 often cool on the stump obama struck a combative note when he told the 2 700 people who came to see him here that mccain had unfairly characterized his position ridiculing him over tire gauges obama said is shallow campaigning on the order of mccains much publicized tv ad likening obama to celebrities britney spears and paris hilton
1720966 obama hit back at john mccain like never before tuesday accusing him of shamefully trying to divide america to conquer the election
1720967 the democratic national committee on wednesday is launching an exxon mccain 08 campaign complete with a gas pump logo and garish red buttons bumper stickers and yard signs
1720968 obama has described nuclear power as not optimal and labeled himself not a nuclear energy proponent
1720969 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama

1720972 when republican presidential candidate john mccain meets thursday with citizens and officials in wilmington ohio he wont need a playbook to understand why theyre worried about deep job losses at the local freight airport little known to those citizens mccain and his campaign manager rick davis played roles in the fate of dhl express and its ohio air park as far back as 2003 back then however their actions that helped dhl and its german owner deutsche post world net acquire the wilmington operations resulted in expansion not retraction
1720973 in a private meeting thursday wilmington residents will ask mccain for help in stopping dhls proposal to quit using the airport as a hub which could cost more than 8 000 jobs dhl says that it wants to stay in the freight business but that it can stem financial losses if it can put its packages aboard the planes of a rival united parcel service before delivering them in dhl trucks ups flies out of louisville ky so the proposed change would render the wilmington airport unnecessary
1720974 none of that was anticipated in 2003 when mccain and davis who was a washington lobbyist before managing the presidential campaign first got involved several wilmington civic leaders said that what happened in 2003 created an economic gain for their community lasting several years but because that gain and now the prospective loss came from the decisions of a foreign owned corporation look for some democrats and labor to seek to tie wilmingtons current troubles to mccain

1720984 but all four of those linebackers were impressive as far as their athletic ability what were looking for is athletic ability at the linebacker position so i dont think we made a mistake at all out of any of those four linebackers thats a bonus without question i dont know if ive been on a staff where we brought in four linebackers and liked all four on the first day the key is do we like them after a year

1721007 the quality of the relationship and bond with your veterinarian is pretty important to feeling good about the health care that youre getting
1721008 that gives the veterinarian the opportunity to not only discover background history but also get to know your pet
1721009 if you find a clinic that has that piece of equipment and the people are appropriately trained thats certainly a nice thing to have available
1721010 if there are top notch specialists in the neighbourhood with all the bells and whistles a lot of practices wont make that investment
1721011 they can send patients down the road and get that expertise and special equipment without having to train themselves
1721012 you can be a brilliant person in terms of your knowledge and ability to diagnose disease but if you cant communicate that effectively with clients you really cant do your job at all

1721020 maybe we like the pain maybe were wired that way because without it i dont know maybe we just wouldnt feel real whats that saying why do i keep hitting myself with a hammer because it feels so good when i stop
1721021 in the case of mccain we know exactly where his policy is
1721022 i know personally mccain for 20 years he is a person of principle and he is also a person who has absolutely a great record of supporting israel getting to obama there is no record nobody can know for sure what will be it can happen to be good it can happen to be very bad its a risk

1721066 it is not in heaven that you should say who will go up to heaven for us to get it for us and make us hear it that we may observe it
1721067 nor is it beyond the sea that you should say who will cross the sea for us to get it for us and make us hear it that we may observe it
1721068 but the word is very near you in your mouth and in your heart that you may observe it

1721115 government including myself including the minister of education were asked by the search committee and by the board of regents to get involved in this process
1721116 we tried to keep our head down on this as much as we can let the process go through because you know any time we came out to speak on this wed be seen to be interfering with the process when nothing is further from the truth
1721117 this is not and will never be a patronage appointment
1721118 professor klein actually wrote me last year a two page letter concerned about the fact that he had not been given enough funding for a venture that he went on with the university
1721119 it was for my information but by the same token why would he bother to write me as premier if he doesnt want us to be interfering with academic autonomy it doesnt add up
1721120 he tried to imply that i was asking him to interfere or that i was asking him for money and i did neither
1721121 the bigger concern for me would be how it even got to the point of coming to the premiers attention
1721122 the chair of the board of regents who is also the chair of the search committee gil dalton violated the rules of the search committee itself
1721123 the search committee has a strict rule of confidentiality and theyre not supposed to be giving to anybody the names of the applicants

1721127 chris how do you consistently maintain such high employee retention
1721128 i simply believe according to the convention on the status of refugees we shouldnt be provided with personal data of persons applying for asylum from the czech republic
1721129 i tried to reach them via fax ive reached them on the phone but the situation did not improve
1721130 czech republic is not a country that persecutes people so we will definitely not look for relatives we will definitely not use this information and i dont even pass that information to prague or anywhere else
1721131 but there have to be clear guidelines and as far as i am aware there are not
1721132 we would not inform embassies about asylum seekers absolutely not
1721133 the reason people are seeking asylum often is because they are in danger and its just not something we would do
1721134 and that is certainly their right that their embassy be contacted
1721135 dont do it even if the person asks you to do it these people claim to be persecuted
1721136 i dont believe the cbsa should blindly follow whatever the asylum seekers ask they should explain it to them this is a danger which should be avoided
1721137 i know cases where the canadian government made inquiries back in india involving people and its resulted in people being tortured
1721138 if trying to verify information about a person results in someone being tortured then we shouldnt do it we have to find other ways of verifying information
1721139 this is something we will have to discuss with cic to make sure the immigration officers get the proper instructions and get the proper training
1721140 a hardened deportation regime is not going to make for practical purposes a difference on the street
1721141 it has no deterrent effect the chance of capture the chance of incarceration the chance of dying on the street is a condition of employment for a street gang member
1721142 a lot of people have this misconception its a full stop weve exported our problem back to the source country it doesnt really work that way
1721143 synchronoss sncr yesterday posted q2 revenue of 24 3 million and profits of 11 cents a share about in line with the street at 24 6 million and 9 cents
1721144 its repeated boxes of candy clothing showing up at your house putting things through your mail slot notes on your car even though youve asked them to stop
1721145 theyre the kindest nicest people you wouldnt know whats really going on you only become aware when clues of their behavior show up when your email provider locks you out because youve logged your password incorrectly too many times for example
1721146 the stalker is usually an isolated and shy person one who lives alone lacks any type of important intimate relationship not just sexual but friends or family too
1721147 theres also a narcissistic personality disorder and very low self esteem the stalker feels that theyre the most important person in the world
1721148 they develop convoluted thoughts about this person they feel this person is the answer to their dreams
1721149 weve seen this in many relationships the stalker figures out your password and reads all your email
1721150 many people use the same password for many things the atm various email accounts and web sites stalkers are often smart enough figure that out and use it to get into email they even get into the victims bank account find out which atm they use find out up to the minute where they went to eat when they shopped
1721151 dont tell them i dont want anything do with you by rejecting that person there is a chance of violence if you reject that person often times they feel angry threatened there is the possibility of violence
1721152 their fantasy is that you love them you really need to be on the offensive theres no harm in changing passwords
1721153 never ever underestimate a threat dont take it lightly even if its in an email take it to the authorities ignore it at your own peril it will only get worse
1721154 unless a stalker wants to change you cant stop them
1721155 they will only change when their world around them starts crashing around them
1721156 a lot of times stalkers have addiction issues they may be drinking or doing drugs its important for them to reach out but they also have to reach in admit something is going on get to a therapist or support group so they dont feel all alone
1721157 whats next for the iphone one firm is betting on virtual cupcakes and tamagotchi like digital pets viximo an 11 month old cambridge mass based start up has created four iphone applications that revolve around digital goods digitally produced images that people buy exchange and display online
1721158 when the applications debut in september or october users will be able to exchange digital goods such as a cupcake to celebrate a birthday or a teddy bear as a get well gift senders will pay anywhere from a few cents to a few dollars for the goods
1721159 recipients will download the digital presents to their phones possibly using links in text messages
1721160 such services are common on social networking sites like facebook where users send and store digital gifts on their online profiles
1721161 but technical and billing complications have kept companies from promoting the practice to cellphone users apples app store ecosystem which uses itunes to access customers phones and bill them takes care of those challenges
1721162 whats more the iphone with its sophisticated touchscreen crisp graphics and motion sensing accelerometer is the perfect showcase for digital goods most digital goods resemble static computer icons the iphone however can allow users to shake a virtual 8 ball drink a can of beer or launch a 15 second movie clip with a flick of their handsets
1721163 retailers could identify iphone owners that walk into certain stores and offer those consumers digital gifts

1721184 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1721185 marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1721186 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1721187 xstratas offer reflects the operational weakness that lonmin has seen which has made lonmin vulnerable
1721188 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly
1721189 xstrata is easily big enough they can afford to buy lonmin certainly
1721190 any change on a year to year basis isnt likely to be significant unless its extremely dramatic
1721191 we are still in a dramatically more violent society than we were at any time prior to 1989
1721192 in any case it seems a little late almost 20 years too late in fact for the conservatives to start screaming about law and order
1721193 or put another way we have returned to the lower levels of violent crime that we had nearly two decades ago an over all decline over a twenty year period
1721194 any takers from the left ok how about you folks on the right nah i didnt think so well then i guess its back to your stats and your discussion on whether we had a 1 increase or decrease last year

1721206 it workers at apple are subject to conditions resembling indentured servitude and in violation of california state law are denied required overtime pay and meal benefits a lawsuit filed monday against the computer maker alleges
1721207 david walsh who worked as a network engineer at apple from 1995 until last year was routinely forced to work more than 40 hours per week missed meals and often had to spend evenings and entire weekends on call without receiving an extra dollar of pay according to the suit
1721208 walshs attorneys contend that he and other apple it workers were purposefully misclassified as management by the company so it could avoid paying them overtime rates that california legally requires for nonmanagement personnel and also to avoid lawsuits

1721216 apples 2 0 1 firmware update accomplishes what hackers had claimed apple couldnt do it relocks an iphone to at amp t the original boast was predicated on the fact that through all of its prior updates apple had never updated the baseband cellular radio firmware well 2 0 1 breaks this tradition and it breaks unlocking
1721217 apples iphone 2 0 1 firmware also breaks iphone open source development my ipod touch sic which never made any trouble for at amp t or apple and never cost any app store vendor a dime in lost sales wont run unix apps any more im back to hauling a notebook around when just my ipod touch would do
1721218 maybe the iphone open source community will hack the iphone open again in the meantime its still possible to operate an iphone or ipod touch with open source jailbreak by avoiding the 2 0 1 firmware update but as it does with itunes apple is adept at turning voluntary updates into a practical necessity by making related products dependent on the latest update
1721219 there is an amicable way out of this the best thing for all concerned would be for apple to enable iphone 2 0 open source development and the running of unsigned applications such as shell or python scripts but only for device owners who explicitly consent to it im all for protecting users from unwittingly welcoming nonpedigreed software into their iphones ill be big about it and set aside the fact that an apple issued pedigree doesnt make software run any better

1721235 activity levels on all our business fronts were high through the second quarter and on balance our operational performance was good

1721239 the record results achieved in the second quarter continue the upward momentum that aecon has established over the last two years

1721279 this improvement was primarily due to improved results at gulfstream park santa anita park and our real estate operations partially offset by disappointing results at the maryland jockey club
1721280 notwithstanding this modest improvement in ebitda for the quarter we recognize the need for further significant improvement in our operating results as we also focus on dramatically reducing our debt levels

1721283 we are in the process of reconsidering whether to sell certain of the assets that were originally identified for disposition under the debt elimination plan
1721284 as a result of these developments combined with our upcoming debt maturities and our operational funding requirements we will again need to seek extensions or additional funds in the short term from one or more possible sources

1721369 we are not witnessing the abandonment of the suburbs or a movement of millions of people back to the city all at once but we are living at a moment in which the massive outward migration of the affluent that characterized the second half of the twentieth century is coming to an end for several decades now cities in the united states have wished for a 24 7 downtown a place where people live as well as work and keep the streets busy interesting and safe at all times of day this is what urbanist jane jacobs preached in the 1960s and it has long since become the accepted goal of urban planners only when significant numbers of people lived downtown planners believed could central cities regain their historic role as magnets for culture and as a source of identity and pride for the metropolitan areas they served now thats starting to happen fueled by the changing mores of the young and by gasoline prices fast approaching 5 per gallon in many of its urbanized regions an america that seemed destined for everincreasing individualization and sprawl is experimenting with new versions of community and sociability why has demographic inversion begun for one thing the deindustrialization of the central city for all the tragic human dislocations it caused has eliminated many of the things that made affluent people want to move away from it nothing much is manufactured downtown anymore or anywhere near it and that means that the noise and grime that prevailed for most of the twentieth century have gone away manhattan may seem like a loud and gritty place now but it is nothing like the city of tenement manufacturing rumbling elevated trains and horses and coal dust in the streets that confronted inhabitants in the early 1900s third floor factory lofts whether in soho or in st louis can be marketed as attractive and stylish places to live the urban historian robert bruegmann goes so far as to claim that deindustrialization has on the whole been good for downtowns because it has permitted so many opportunities for creative reuse of the buildings i wouldnt go quite that far and given the massive job losses of recent years i doubt most of the residents of detroit would either but it is true that the environmental factors that made middle class people leave the central city for streetcar suburbs in the 1900s and for station wagon suburbs in the 1950s do not apply any more

1721448 we just had to put our money where our mouths were we had to take it to the next level you always want your next record to be better than your last

1721452 manhattan is actually a native american word that means island of many hills
1721453 he and jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing wall ball and get serious rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us it kind of took the pressure off
1721454 we had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands on as far as the production goes
1721455 we wanted to prove ourselves a bit more we got to kick our heels up have drinks and relax while recording
1721456 you can tell from the music that were definitely comfortable
1721457 to me it sounds like the kings of leon are back not only as a band but as friends
1721458 every night after recording wed go to a bar together hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day rather than all of us going to our separate homes it was really a big family vibe thats where the title comes from its also a reference to a poem by edgar allan poe and it has five syllables like all of our album titles
1721459 i think the pain pills inspired him a little more than he realized
1721460 he would play us a song and wed say when did you write that
1721461 those pills can make you feel so nice i think a lot of the pretty melodies came from that and from me just opening more
1721462 we definitely wanted the songs to sound good in a 15 000 seat venue but we also wanted them to have the kind of intimacy that would get the point across at a club show for 300 kids

1721470 we are in contact with the colombian authorities to ask for further clarifications as to exactly what happened
1721471 reveals that a member of the army team involved was wearing a tabard marked with the red cross emblem before the operation had even begun suggesting intentional misuse
1721472 if authenticated these images would clearly establish an improper use of the red cross emblem which we deplore
1721473 this officer upon confessing his mistake to his superiors said when the rescue helicopter was about to land he saw so many guerrillas that he went into a state of angst
1721474 he feared for his life and put on the red cross bib over his jacket
1721475 red cross red crescent and red crystal emblems is governed by the geneva conventions and their additional protocols
1721476 these emblems may not be used by bodies or persons not entitled to do so under international humanitarian law
1721477 if you use the emblem in a deceitful way generally the conventions say it would be a breach based on the information as explained to me the way that the images show the red cross emblem being used could be distinguished as a war crime
1721478 complete and total respect for the red cross emblem is essential if the icrc is to be able to bring assistance and protection to the people worst affected by armed conflicts and other situations of violence
1721479 as a neutral and impartial humanitarian organization the icrc depends on the trust of all the parties to the conflict to be able to carry out its humanitarian work

1721517 i went to slow food nations parent terra madre in italy
1721518 it was life changing i plan to go to slow food nation because i do not want to miss another chance for a life changing event
1721519 terra madre was a heart event it was a thrill to see families still making the food they have made for centuries you feel this human thing it was very emotional and made me cry some recipes for corn bread for example had been handed down for twenty generations
1721520 i love the apple farmers here in sonoma county they are courageous there is a history here that we need to remember
1721521 slow food is an opportunity to reconnect with our food and local growers and to understand the plight our planet is in our immunity and the immune system of the earth are linked building from here is a source of our healing
1721522 it helps create a sense of what real nourishment is it brings farmers children and the community back into the food system rather than leaving it in the hands of large corporations slow food encourages people to grow and cook their own food and remember the pleasure in that
1721523 it was intense being around people from over 150 countries in their traditional dress who have this common bond and language of the land growing food preserving local food cultures preparing serving and nourishing others

1721593 we kissed and i assured her that everything was going to be okay before she went into the operating theatre i never thought that it would be the last time we would speak with each other
1721594 she was concerned over the large amount of fatty tissue as well as excess skin hanging around her waist
1721595 dr varughese also suggested that my wife be sedated and that he would be using local anaesthetic to ensure that she did not feel anything
1721596 dr raja was in attendance and had administered the anesthetic on my wife during the operation
1721597 however about 7 10pm i was told that my wife had suffered a cardiac arrest and that resuscitation procedures were undertaken my wife was then put on a ventilator
1721598 nik rosemawati was at the icu for two days where her condition continued to deteriorate and she died on june 23 2004 without regaining consciousness
1721599 it seems like they expect us to be more like men like grow up already i think last year they the old coaching staff just kind of let us slide with a lot of stuff
1721600 im not saying last year the coaches werent upbeat but these guys theyre anxious
1721601 they want to prove that were ready and that theyre worthy
1721602 they teach us a lot of things its very intense no walking around no nothing
1721603 i think a lot of guys have grown up and realize consequences and understand what they have and what they could potentially lose
1721604 theyve got to realize they are employees of the state of washington
1721605 hes happy to get moving on with this part of his career

1721611 so its a little different in that aspect but the no 1s are going to have to be ready to go back in if needed but its a great opportunity for some young guys to play a lot
1721612 hes working hard and were going to try to get him up to speed as much as possible and well see where hes at when we kick it off

1721614 it feels good and its gotten a lot stronger its coming along they didnt think that it would get to this point and right now everybodys saying that was the best thing you did to not get surgery people pray for me and im glad for that it might be a miracle i dont know but im happy
1721615 weve won three in a row its kind of fun
1721616 its working out and i just keep trying to whatever i can to help out
1721617 i think if we could get him to come up without anyone on first wed be ok because wed just walk him
1721618 he looks good in practice but i think when the lights click on some people have that ability to show up and shine and i think hes one of those guys
1721619 hes working hard he a guy who doesnt say much but hes intense and he wants to win

1721624 and thats why the bhmk was destroyed because of the bad behavior of the extremists otherwise the jews might have been stronger for longer and who knows how it could have ended
1721625 really the talmud says it was destroyed because of sinas chinam
1721626 because burning the food supply and causing the suffering and starvation of men women and children sure sounds like sinas chinam to me

1721669 demi ayahku dan ibuku ya rasulullah tolong jelaskan pada kami tentang keutamaannya agar menambah semangat kami untuk berpuasa dan qiyamul layl agar kami lebih bersungguh sungguh di dalamnya
1721670 barangsiapa yang berpuasa satu hari di bulan syaban allah mencatat baginya tujuh puluh kebajikan berbanding dengan ibadah satu tahun
1721671 sekiranya dosa dosamu sebanyak jumlah bintang bintang di langit sebanyak tetesan hujan dan daun daun pepohonan butiran pasir dan sebanyak jumlah hari di dunia niscaya dia mengampunimu itulah karunia yang kemuliaan dari allah setelah kamu berpuasa di bulan syaban

1721673 sesungguhnya puasa nabi saw di bulan syaban bersambung dengan puasa bulan ramadhan
1721674 bapak bapakku yang terbaik adalah rasulullah saw beliau paling banyak berpuasa di bulan syaban
1721675 puasa di bulan ramadhan adalah simpanan bagi seorang hamba untuk hari kiamat tidak ada seorangpun yang banyak berpuasa di bulan syaban kecuali allah memperbaiki urusan penghidupannya melindunginya dari keburukan musuhnya dan yang paling sedikit adalah orang yang berpuasa satu hari di bulan syaban wajib baginya surga
1721676 barangsiapa yang berpuasa tiga hari di bulan syaban maka wajib baginya surga dan rasulullah saw pemberi syafaat baginya pada hari kiamat

1721682 malam nishfu syaban adalah malam allah membebaskan hamba nya dari api neraka dan mengampuni dosa dosa
1721683 di dalamnya tidak ada sesuatu yang harus menjadi beban tetapi jika kamu ingin melakukan sesuatu maka hendaknya melakukan shalat jafar ath thayyar shalat tasbih dan perbanyaklah di dalamnya zikir kepada allah azza wa jalla istighfar dan doa karena ayahku berkata doa di dalamnya mustajabah

1721693 they have taken natural landscapes and turned them into industrial sites
1721694 the coalition gives us the chance to increase the volume and to represent ourselves as mainstream
1721695 we need to put an end to flawed government policies that distort the markets raise food prices artificially and pit producers against consumers

1721698 but if you go in and undermine the foundation of the ethanol industry today youll set back the development of those next generation technologies
1721699 the costs being incurred by organic producers are rising much faster than for conventional production
1721700 the price we get currently for organic milk is not high enough to cover the cost of production there will have to be an increase in the price that producers receive
1721701 in this context it is no longer attractive for conventional farms to convert and we are seeing producers undergoing conversion exiting that process the concern is that the relatively small number of leavers becomes a mass exit among existing producers
1721702 there is a real danger that a supply shortage could take hold rather quickly if just 30 of our larger organic farms revert to non organic production we will lose 10 per cent of our supplies
1721703 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers
1721704 it is a bitter irony for us but after so many years of talking about the virtues of growing your own and british produce people are doing it and it is resulting in a fall in trade

1721709 what the hell is that supposed to mean who the fuck are you to imply that someone who has faced tragedy should have to cry and sob all the time even in public because that is behavior you deem appropriate for that particular tragedy how dare you think for one fucking second that the true meaning behind what youre saying isnt showing through do you have a brain can you use it if she had been crying carrying on in public you would have thought she was either completely insane over exaggerating for attention or she was selfishly laying her grief on everyone else so which is it sobbing and crying in public or smiling for the first time in days or maybe it should be a happy medium a somber look and a forced smile every once in awhile is that what youre looking for fuck off

1721744 tattooing has traditionally been a marginal activity among civilized people the calling card of cannibals sailors and whores the appropriate place for it is on the margins in the back alleys the skid rows the mainstreaming of tattoos on main street is a harbinger of social dysfunction

1721768 while the grand jury can and should speak freely about the library directors management style and critique her management skills we cannot and will not participate in a public discussion of what must for us be a private personnel issue
1721769 our interpretation of the law is that personnel evaluations must be conducted in a way that protects the privacy rights of the employee
1721770 we cannot publicly discuss our views about the library directors performance
1721771 it will be an opportunity to move on and move forward for the entire organization
1721772 this past year has been a very difficult one for the library but we now have a key opportunity to clearly face and address issues that hold us back from providing the very best library services our customers want and deserve
1721773 i intend to seize that opportunity and look forward to working with all of you on these important areas
1721774 i guess the best way to put it is if theres an announcement today id be as surprised as anybody else
1721775 its a matter of principle than the size of the dollars
1721776 the only person that mitch daniels is interested in protecting is himself and hoosiers are tired of this governor and his out of touch campaign spin while mitch daniels spends millions publicly patting himself on the back taxpayers wont soon forget that his balanced budget was created on the backs of homeowners across this state
1721777 the overriding goal of house republicans for the next session of the general assembly is to adopt an honestly balanced budget with no gimmicks or tax increases to enact permanent constitutional tax caps for every hoosier taxpayer and allow taxpayers to keep as much of their money as possible with committed republican leadership the states prior record of deficit spending will remain behind us and the fiscal integrity of the last three years will be continued
1721778 i am glad gov daniels has finally responded to my repeated calls for tax relief for hoosiers unfortunately the governors rhetoric doesnt match reality with his plan hoosiers wont be getting a rebate this year the states surplus was built on the backs of working people as a direct result of the increased taxes property cigarette sales and local income taxes that mitch daniels pushed through at this critical time in our states history we need leaders who will act immediately to reverse our downward economic slide and give hard working families a break from the high taxes that this administration has imposed
1721779 i dont think that question is going to come up in this next budget cycle
1721780 but i think its a good long term planning discussion

1721788 i do think evan has an excellent chance of being chosen but i dont think its going to be wednesday
1721789 all i know is that theyre going to be together
1721790 but i would guess that he would not announce his vice presidential choice tomorrow even if it should be evan bayh i just dont see that happening in a small indiana town that seems like a larger venue
1721791 the idea that presidential candidates are in elkhart is too much to wrap your head around
1721792 indiana has always been such a sure thing its the example i use in class an example of a state you dont need to spend time in for either party
1721793 with bayh on the ticket it gets a little more interesting but i still think indiana is a long shot
1721794 indiana is largely a conservative state and i dont think hoosiers were taken with obamas liberal rhetoric
1721795 sen obama apparently has made it a personal mission to win indiana but we are very comfortable that once again in indiana the republican nominee for president will prevail
1721796 our softball team is a juggernaut so i cant see why we cancelled a game
1721797 then come october there wont be any money to pay your employees
1721798 this extension is available to any political subdivision and the city would like to take advantage of this additional time to prepare the 2009 budget
1721799 were putting them into an area that formerly housed four or five state board of accounts employees probably 14 by 24 in size
1721800 but it is the best we can do with the space available currently in the civic center
1721801 it will be up to the county council what happens to their salaries in 2009
1721802 the judges hire 27 attorneys who have got to raise campaign money we need to take the politics out of those courts
1721803 i understand that despite the great work of our local companies the manufactured housing industry is in the midst of a nine year downturn in housing production levels
1721804 with so many hoosiers jobs related to manufactured housing i have worked to ensure that the federal government fosters a business climate that will allow our local companies to remain competitive and hopefully even grow i believe this legislation will not only give the industry a shot in the arm but it will also help make the federal housing administrations title i loan program more financially sound
1721805 ive only been charged im not guilty and i think its unfounded
1721806 youre always guilty by the public no matter what you do
1721807 in any office that you hold you make a mistake and get charged like this and the repercussions are great
1721808 i just apologize for putting the school corporation in this situation and any embarrassment
1721809 were truly delighted to offer discerning mac enthusiasts our highest quality in keyboard design and performance
1721810 from the piano black finish to its built in touchdisc touch pad the dinovo edge can make it a pleasure for you to type control music or launch your favorite applications
1721811 the side effects that have been reported are real and they cannot be brushed aside
1721812 physicians have a responsibility to communicate risks to patients and if patients and families are concerned it is reasonable to hold off on vaccinating
1721813 the scientific work to date seems to suggest that aluminum salts in vaccines are safe
1721814 merck has analyzed the adverse events reported for gardasil relating to the recent reports of death and paralysis and based on the data available to merck believes that no safety issue related to the vaccine has been identified these types of events are events that could also be seen in the general population
1721815 she went from being a healthy active teen running playing lacrosse and participating on swim team to becoming a chronically ill patient
1721816 i worry about the kids who may be having problems are perhaps struggling with immune damage and are feeling generally achy and unwell but are probably going unreported and undiagnosed
1721817 pasteur was widely supported but on his death bed conceded that beauchamp was right
1721818 even if everyone was vaccinated we would still have cervical cancer
1721819 i dont want people to be lulled into thinking this will prevent cancer if pap screening rates decline cervical cancer rates will rise
1721820 these types of pictures will soon disappear in clinical oncology
1721821 no one would want to wait to see cervical cancer develop in participants
1721822 but the general failure to mention that the precancerous lesions chosen for study are not only potentially removable most those that are cin 2 would probably have resolved on their own without any intervention is arguable
1721823 while vaccine proponents emphasize the many thousands of women who participated in clinical trials of the product they gloss over how few young girls in the 9 to 13 year age range targeted specifically for school based immunizations were included
1721824 we are simply still in the early stages of investigation
1721825 there is no question that early detection will continue to be a key element
1721826 does not mean that a causal relationship between an event and vaccination has been established just that the event occurred after vaccination
1721827 certainly shouldnt be over interpreted but nevertheless points in a direction where further research is needed
1721828 its a wonderful technology and people are certainly going to be using it more and more
1721829 we need to be looking into what are the potential health effects and what are ways to reduce risks should there be any
1721830 another possible explanation for the observed association might be the lack of attention given to a child by mothers who are frequent users of cell phones
1721831 we felt that the public is quite capable of dealing with proper information
1721832 have you ever wondered why cancer treatment has not changed much in over 70 years why is chemotherapy still the mainstay of conventional cancer treatment after all these years of disappointing results for the majority of cancer cell types
1721833 go home there is nothing we can really do for you
1721834 increases in glycosolation in hemoglobin imply lessening of control of diabetes
1721835 the mechanisms involved in the alteration of thyroid hormone homeostasis are still not fully understood
1721836 because of the structural similarity between some organochlorines and thyroid hormones organochlorines are suspected to either decrease or mimic the biological action of thyroid hormones
1721837 as neurological development occurs in discrete developmental windows even transient disorders in thyroid hormone availability can have profound effects on brain development
1721838 there is increasing need for longitudinal studies measuring the effect of postnatal exposure and possible causal relationships between organochlorines thyroid function and neurodevelopment during childhood
1721839 oestrogenic compounds in food or the environment have been of concern for a number of years but we have mostly thought that it was boys exposed in the uterus before birth who were most at risk
1721840 many men are obviously worried about whether their lifestyle or diet could affect their fertility by lowering their sperm count
1721841 oestrogenic compounds in food or the environment have been of concern for a number of years but we have mostly thought that it was boys exposed in the uterus before birth who were most at risk
1721842 we will have to look at adult diet more closely although the fact that such large parts of the world have soy food as a major part of their diet and dont appear to suffer any greater infertility rates than those on western diets suggests that any effect is quite small

1721851 to get salvation we must not only do some things but everything which god has commanded
1721852 one of the most fallacious doctrines originated by satan and propounded by man is that man is saved alone by the grace of god that belief in jesus christ alone is all that is needed for salvation
1721853 for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them
1721854 for whoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point is guilty of all
1721855 for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them
1721856 good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
1721857 if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give it to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me
1721858 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin
1721859 christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree
1721860 there is no overall credible evidence of an increase in cancer
1721861 we should not be diverted from using vytorin by fears of cancer
1721862 the study has given a clear cut answer whether lipid lowering will influence the cause of aortic stenosis and we can conclude it does not
1721863 overall it looks positive they did decrease atherosclerotic events which is sort of what everyone expected
1721864 but weve seen with drugs in the past any time cancer gets tagged on them sometimes the prescriptions can come off a little bit
1721865 the bottom line is there was a trade off in this trial in a reduction in some cardiovascular events and an excess of cancer deaths its obviously not a favorable result
1721866 the concern is how this is going to be portrayed and perceived and is it just going to be another issue where there is a lot of negative publicity surrounding the drug
1721867 one program within the u s environmental protection agency has identified the chemical as a cancer hazard and notes that it caused reproductive problems developmental defects anemia liver failure and eye and skin irritation in laboratory animals
1721868 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
1721869 we found no overall increased risk of brain tumors among cellular phone users the potential elevated risk of brain tumors after long term cellular phone use awaits confirmation by future studies
1721870 if there is a risk from these products and at this point we do not know that there is it is probably very small
1721871 growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
1721872 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
1721873 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain
1721874 i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
1721875 the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users
1721876 we certainly dont know of any mechanism by which radiofrequency exposure would cause a cancerous effect in cells we just dont know this might possibly occur
1721877 by all means if a person feels compelled that they should take precautions in reducing the amount of electromagnetic radio waves through their bodies by all means they should do so
1721878 but at the same time we have to remember theres no conclusive evidence that links cell phones to cancer whether its brain tumors or other forms of cancer
1721879 when you look at the overwhelming majority of studies that have been peer reviewed and published in scientific journals around the world youll find no relationship between wireless usage and adverse health affects
1721880 i dont want to get it brain cancer and i certainly dont want you to get it
1721881 i think if they gave me specific numbers and specific information and it was scary enough i would be concerned
1721882 without specific numbers its too vague to get me worked up

1721885 these girls think its a cute game but its inappropriate and its unnecessary
1721886 i couldnt possibly know if its real or not but i know that its probably not necessary for most children to have a cell phone
1721887 its part of this whole rush to adulthood hello kitty backpacks for third graders have cell phone pockets in them marketers have skillfully created a groundswell of begging among kids and we all know that begging can work

1721890 i always know where my kids are a cell phone is a tool to negotiate the world once you have the responsibility to be out in the world on your own
1721891 i think a lot of parents in this country just give in
1721892 if youve got good reasons for them to have it id go ahead
1721893 how do you deal with the unknown we just dont have the data
1721894 girls tend to get them younger its become a status symbol it makes them feel grown up
1721895 so many scary studies come out this will give some parents second thoughts and other parents ammunition but for the vast majority its not going to mean a lot
1721896 all of the other studies on sildenafil in women have not been positive
1721897 i think it would be hard to use the results without further study
1721898 this would not be a drug to be used for a 55 year old woman who complains of decreased desire who is not on ssris
1721899 if its used for that youre not going to get results and youre going to have a frustrated patient

1721907 two important minnesota court cases regarding the implied consent law were decided in the past several months
1721908 minnesotas implied consent law states that every time you drive operate or are in physical control of a motor vehicle on the roadways lakes and waterways within the state of minnesota you consent to a chemical test of your blood urine or breath by law enforcement to determine the presence of alcohol a controlled substance or a hazardous substance in your body
1721909 shriner state v shriner 751 nw 2d 538 who drove into the wrong lane of traffic and struck another vehicle head on was the first of the cases involving implied consent law this defendant showed signs of intoxication at the scene and the officer had her blood drawn at hospital to determine her blood alcohol level in court shriner challenged the fact that the officer had neither obtained a warrant to take a blood sample from her nor read her the implied consent advisory nor obtained her consent although the minnesota court of appeals affirmed the trial courts decision in favor of the defendant shriner the minnesota supreme court reversed the appellate court decision and ruled that shriners blood test results were admissible and her dwi charges would stand
1721910 in this case underdahl argued that if he had the code he could determine whether the machine was reliable and therefore whether his test results were legitimate the district court ordered the state to produce the code however the appellate court ruled that unless a defendant shows that the source code is relevant the code is not discoverable
1721911 the media made it sound like discovering the source code for the breathalyzer machine was going to be a golden cure for those facing dui charges yet the courts have been very clear that is will difficult to prove that the code is relevant to your case
1721912 the shriner case is helpful if you are facing charges other than criminal vehicular homicide or operation because a challenge could be made that you must either consent or give or be served a valid search warrant for a sample of your blood urine or breath
1721913 i believe that these are the types of rulings we will be seeing more of in the future a sort of ad hoc web of judicial interpretation of legislative intent woven one situation at a time

1721916 it isnt recommended to hang around underwater this is the end of your exploits
1721917 air fresheners laundry products and other consumer specialty products are regulated under the federal hazardous substances act and subsequently have strict labeling requirements
1721918 companies producing products that are regulated under fhsa must name on the product label each component that contributes to the hazard
1721919 if it smells bad its bad if it smells good its bad
1721920 its a reasonable expectation to think that laundry products and air fresheners would be free of chemicals that can cause cancer
1721921 but as this uw study shows its disturbingly easy to find toxic chemicals in everyday products like these because companies dont have to say whats in their products
1721922 chemicals are not present in the products at levels deemed hazardous under the law given the limited space on product labels it is important to include the relevant information consumers need to make intelligent use storage and disposal decisions
1721923 these chemicals get into our water systems and into puget sound
1721924 we regulate many of these chemicals in other circumstances yet when theyre in products that were in contact with daily in some cases we dont wind up finding out about them
1721925 any time you have a product that is regulated by many different agencies its easy for them not to react
1721926 consumer demand for less toxic products will encourage companies to reformulate their products
1721927 this is a case where a little information could have a great public benefit

1721985 many governments have been trying to protect people by using subsidies and encouraging companies not to pass the full oil prices
1721986 however this policy is difficult to maintain the public also needs to understand the issue and to overcome future challenges
1721987 the government should increase the price of lpg or demand will grow rapidly and for the time being we dont have the capacity to handle it
1721988 maybe next year we will have to import 1 million tones if prices are not raised
1721989 with a growing economy emerging middle class and a scarcity of us style retail centres mexico represents a compelling retail investment opportunity
1721990 it really depends on where you see oil prices headed im taking a one year view and theres no definite buy signal right now for airlines
1721991 the question is if oil prices will stay low and if demand will recover the us and europe markets are seeing slowing passenger demand and those are significant destinations for all airlines
1721992 fuel might offer a short term respite as it comes off a bit but without demand you cant see airline profits improving at least for another year
1721993 unless the twin negatives of high oil prices and slowing global economic growth outlook are reversed the airline sector is likely to trade on newsflow rather than on fundamental outlook
1721994 near term we expect a falling oil price trend would be extremely positive for the airline sector and more than offset slowing global economic growth particularly for asian airlines where intra asia and asia middle east travel remains resilient
1721995 the key question for us is whether the airlines can continue to hold out at current high oil prices
1721996 sia has the strong net cash position to withstand an industry downturn and will gain market share at the expense of the weaker capitalised airlines post any consolidations
1721997 we view china airlines as the cheapest exposure to the direct china link theme with the lowest insolvency risk as the carrier is backed by the taiwan government
1721998 the airlines are trying to realign in particular on the cost side because you cannot control revenue and the end demand seems to be easing
1721999 this investment gives eye fi the long term resources to establish this new category of products and services that help consumers manage and share their digital memories

1722001 eye fi is changing the game for consumers and the photography services industry by making it simple for consumers to share and store their digital memories
1722002 we see a big growth opportunity for eye fi to expand into new markets like europe and asia where digital photography is already an established practice

1722207 my conclusion then is that it is not so that the coercive laws that the state enforces must massively infringe the autonomy of those subject to the laws and can only be justified inter alia if the system of laws provides adequate compensation for this loss of autonomy if the laws steer people toward acts that all things considered they morally ought to perform then either they do not actually infringe on autonomy if those regulated by the laws are reasonable and moral or they do infringe on autonomy if those regulated by the laws are prone to act immorally and coerced by the laws to refrain from doing so but the autonomy that is thereby lost is not significantly valuable in neither case does the imposition of state coercion generate an obligation to compensate those who are coerced the reasonable and moral are not coerced and the unreasonable and immoral are not deserving of compensation to offset the harm coercion imposes on them

1722249 considerable research has shown childrens emergent literacy skills the skills knowledge and attitudes that are necessary for the development of reading and writing are important for later reading success
1722250 a result gained by effort and the quality and quantity of work
1722251 high achievement is a function of three categories of factors a opportunity factors e
1722252 we have made considerable gains in the first area the awareness that has been created among the public is irreversible we have also succeeded in sensitising the honest and true judges to the plight of the people there have been setbacks on november 3 but this was a defeat in a minor battle in a long drawn out war we are confident that in whatever way the judiciary is restored it will emerge as an independent organ of the state as far as the political parties are concerned we have to go a long way in that area
1722253 the coming few months will be critical our movement was anti establishment and for civilian supremacy there has been a slight change which is manifest in the recalling of serving officers working in civilian departments on deputation however we must not forget that we are fighting an entrenched system that is 60 years old there are also foreign pressures we cannot ignore the advice of our friends abroad the lawyers also do not want the system to collapse because that will be against the very objective that we have been advocating we need to bring a change in the real power structure to empower the people
1722254 i personally feel it has encouraged many women to contest elections on general seats
1722255 in addition to the support of the party women need support from the entire family which has to work as a team then there is the issue of expenditure contesting an election in this country costs a lot of money reserving seats for women helps to overcome these hurdles and bring those women to the legislature who have been affiliated with the party but do not have the wherewithal to contest elections
1722256 they got important positions within the party for instance three women are serving as information secretaries in the ppp one federal and two provincial
1722257 this was the imperceptible impact of womens presence in the legislature and not due to any action taken in this regard
1722258 we want to enhance the quota of women in both public and private sector upto 20 percent after the establishment of first women bank in 1988 many women have become successful entrepreneurs more women need to be encouraged to become economically independent
1722259 if there is some issue concerning a woman i feel it more acutely and have always taken a firm stand
1722260 but men dont feel uncomfortable either in interacting with me because as an elected representative one tends to lose ones gender and is looked upon as a person
1722261 the new government will be a broad based coalition and women will have the opportunity to work across party lines on the many issues concerning them in some areas women have not been allowed to vote at others they are the victims of various customs our party will support legislation for improving the status of women
1722262 my proposals for the development of my area could not materialise because the party leadership listened to the directly elected mna and mpas of my areas
1722263 this prompted me to join the ppp to be able to fulfill my agenda i faced great difficulties but in the end i was successful due to the peoples support
1722264 this is a good idea but at the moment women legislator are not confident of their political standing and identity and cannot act independently they are beholden to the male members of their respective parties hopefully they will gain confidence with time and we see this idea materialising
1722265 you guys have to wait until noon and then we will tell you when the flight will take off if it ever will
1722266 amp 11 35 i got myself another coffee and thought about leaving the airport and take another flight
1722267 you are joking i am dialing the fax number to send them a complaint
1722268 but you did not cancel 24 hours before we are charging you for the first night
1722269 but i am only staying for one night and because of the cancellation of the flights i would not even be in paris it is a bit silly
1722270 i dont like the idea you are hanging about in the train station in france
1722271 lucky you someone just cancelled it leaves at 20 46 no changes 116 euros
1722272 well if they call you before your departure i will try to fix it for you just come and see me
1722273 oh just concern about your safety making sure you can come back
1722274 does it surprise you there is no common language you both speak and i am still on the train
1722275 cool thanks man i will call you once i get to the apartment
1722276 your mom called in the middle of the night i dont know what she was talking about
1722277 the news of the killing of the 13 men was first disclosed to me by the secretary in my office a lady who served as chessons secretary in the same office before the coup
1722278 there was a boy and his mother that went down to the stream for water where they saw monks attempting to follow thier masters instructions and swim upstream
1722279 why do you smile on the one standing and not attempting and scold the others
1722280 see how the struggling students lose and not gain ground for thier actions life is a river you may fight it all you wish you will only find your playing its game and losing or you may acqueisce and bow to life admitting it is the more powerful force but that you do not wish to move
1722281 look see the rivers current is defeated with all monks standing and defying it in such a way the current loses strength and is calmer farther downstream only by all working together in a peaceful manner can they calm the waters but also think no one person less important than the others for a gap in the line would push the current into a roar and only strengthen it such is the way of life

1722288 acquire knowledge of the various conceptions of literacy in the 21st century
1722289 i am able to maneuver through a program i am unfamiliar with summarize a paragraph in a word processing document decipher fact from fiction in a news article uncover bias in a supposedly neutral review and navigate through hypermedia successfully however by no means am i an expert in any of the above categories i think i still have a lot to learn when it comes to being digitally literate
1722290 i feel like literacy is much more than i once imagined i thought that too be literate one had to be able to read and write in various mediums after reading the article by eshet alkali y amp amichai hamburger y i have realized that literacy includes things like sending email and even understanding the complex navigation system involved in using the internet
1722291 acquire knowledge of what constitutes acceptable sources and resources within a profession and in the 21st century
1722292 since wikipedia is ever changing an actual wikipedia article itself should not be referenced for student use the reason being that after a student finds all the information in the particular article credible it is possible that the information could be changed to inaccurate information
1722293 i think that this weeks website evaluation techniques will prove very helpful to me in the coming weeks when it comes time for me to sort through resources as they relate to my research question
1722294 acquire knowledge of the professional issues relating to literacy within the asha scope of practice
1722295 copyright and fair use guidelines can be difficult to understand and make sense of but when you are not sure about copying or using a portion of someone elses work it is best to check with a copyright expert or not use the material
1722296 acquire knowledge of the forms of inquiry associated with evidence based practice
1722297 this week i learned about the three rs of inquiry evaluating sources on the web searching for reliable sources as they relate to my research questions and more about mailing lists

1722302 this week i wanted to take a more serious look at my i search paper and review the critiques of my paper that my peers provided i was excited to see that as an assignment because i feel like it is very helpful for all of us
1722303 demonstrate enhanced communication skills and strategies using the discourse of the discipline in both oral and written formats
1722304 participate and collaborate synchronously and asynchronously in online professional communities
1722305 demonstrate self confident interdependence in multiple digital spaces and with multiple forms of media
1722306 the sentiments recently expressed by the archbishop of canterbury and the lord chief justice concerning sharia law are very telling in the rush to be tolerant or sensitive to religious difference they create the space for the most reactionary and even fundamentalist religious leaders to take control of minority communities and they enable a climate which allows religion to define our roles in both private and public spaces
1722307 their sentiments appear contingent on the false assumption that black and minority cultures are intrinsically opposed to universal human rights principles and that they do not contribute to the body of law based on such principles that now inform the english legal system in doing so they allow religious and cultural contexts to become the overriding framework within which those from ethnic and religious minorities are perceived inevitably drawing on very narrow assumptions about religion and the role of women
1722308 search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting

1722360 i was like hey if i can get free skateboards and get to travel around and people wanna pay me money to skateboard thats what i wanted that was my goal
1722361 before my accident i was playing a little bit i guess music was just an itch that needed to be scratched it was a rash on the surface a little bug bite and now its a bleeding sore
1722362 and then i remember that for hours i dunno if it was a good thing or a bad thing but id be entertained by banging on a bowl
1722363 i would sit there and hit it in different areas to get different sounds and then i would spin it on my finger and hit it as i spinned it and i was so amazed by that
1722364 when youre reading his books it feels like youre understanding things at a more mature level but he breaks it down and makes it simple
1722365 its a read for everyman hes not trying to strain your brain hes just giving it to you straightforward and its something that you can actually use in your life also when i started writing songs i tried to look at it as i would look at a steinbeck book in the sense that when someone would look back on it 60 years later would it still hold up well
1722366 every week id go to his house and id have a new song written and id record that song and it was the kind of thing where through that id just come over and show him whatever records i was into and wed share music and we ended up hanging out a lot and becoming really close friends
1722367 id go over there at five in the afternoon and not leave until four in the morning and go home with a disc of ideas wed recorded that day and all the things we talked about like books and things like that it happened really naturally and so much was created out of it he was really a mentor
1722368 once we started having more and more songs he was like ill help you release these lets put em out together id put out some stuff before on my own but we decided to print up a really small amount of these eps id been doing shows around the southern california area and then we printed the cd up and i started getting more gigs because of that next thing we knew we had all these songs and all these ideas and it was like well why dont we just keep going with this lets put out a record so i kept going and we made debut album songs we sing everything ive done so far has been with tom and its been a really good process

1722373 the chemicals are locked in shale so they wont go anywhere
1722374 its not a groundswell but its certainly interesting to see
1722375 what weve had is particularly under this administration the spectacle of people calling for limited government and states rights sending federal law enforcement in to prosecute people whove used medical marijuana in conformance with their own states laws this bill would put an end to that practice

1722415 you get a lot of really interesting people that are often in various scenes together and who listen to the same kinds of music

1722418 i had a little connection in the tattoo world the tattoo guys i knew were playing my cds in their shops and the guys that would apprentice underneath them might open up their own shops and if they liked my music would play it too its a great way to play gigs where theres no constraints that you might find in a more typical music venue it can be all ages all kinds of shenanigans can be going on and the people who show up really want to see the show
1722419 i had been hoping to go into the studio with my band and a good producer and do it the way people make good records
1722420 but it turned out that i was going to be doing it on my own because i didnt have a lot of money the songs were so naked and raw and they had a good feeling with just a guitar and i thought i could do this in a day and make it really simple and raw like the way they made the old blues records part of it was i needed something to sell because i was ready to tour and part of it was i had all these songs i recorded it in one day and i called a friend that day and asked him to draw up some artwork for me and i mixed it a couple days later it feels like a return to the rawness of the records i appreciated as a kid where you can hear every nuance of the singers voice and theres nothing to hide behind

1722457 chalking out plans on scientific research in vital areas financing research activities on an annual basis and cooperating with higher educational institutions and research centres in the country are the major responsibilities of the authority
1722458 this authority will spread awareness in the society about the importance of research innovation and development it will consequently work to find different resources to finance these activities from both inside or outside the uae
1722459 in fact data is available in most of these institutions the problem is how to compile information and process it in a way that enhances decision making

1722472 tidakkah kalian percaya padaku sedangkan aku adalah kepercayaan yang berada di atas langit datang kepadaku wahyu dari langit di waktu pagi dan petang
1722473 orang orang yang penyayang akan disayangi oleh yang maha rahman sayangilah siapa saja yang ada di bumi niscaya kalian akan disayangi oleh yang berada di atas langit
1722474 demikianlah pendapat kami bahwa setiap orang yang ditanyakan di manakah alloh dia segera menjawab dengan fitrahnya alloh di atas langit

1722477 orang yang tidak meyakini alloh subhanahu wa taala di atas langit adalah orang sesat

1722482 barang siapa tidak meyakini alloh di atas langit adalah sesat
1722483 barang siapa yang tidak meyakini alloh itu di dalam lingkup langit sehingga alloh terbatasi dan diliputi langit
1722484 barang siapa yang tidak meyakini apa yang tercantum di dalam kitab dan sunnah serta telah disepakati oleh generasi awal umat ini dan para ulamanya yaitu alloh berada di atas langit bersemayam di atas arsy nya terpisah dari makhluk nya maka dia benar siapa saja yang tidak meyakininya berarti mendustakan rosul shollallohu alaihi wa sallam dan mengikuti selain orang orang yang beriman bahkan sesungguhnya dia telah menolak dan meniadakan tuhannya sehingga pada hakikatnya tidak memiliki tuhan yang disembah tidak ada tuhan yang dimintainya tidak ada tuhan yang ditujunya
1722485 semua bayi itu dilahirkan dalam keadaan fitrah kedua orang tuanyalah yang menjadikannya yahudi nasrani atau majusi sebagaimana seekor binatang melahirkan anak dengan utuh tanpa ada anggota tubuh yang hilang apakah menurutmu ada yang hilang telinganya tanpa sebab sejak dari lahirnya
1722486 itulah fitrah alloh yang manusia diciptakan berada di atasnya tidak ada penggantian dalam fitrah alloh
1722487 ikutilah agama orang orang badui dan anak anak kecil yang masih asli yakinilah fitrah yang telah alloh berikan kepada mereka karena alloh menetapkan bahwa fitrah hamba fitrah dan untuk memperkuat fitrah bukan untuk menyimpangkan dan juga bukan untuk mengubahnya
1722488 dan apabila kamu melihat orang orang yang mempermainkan ayat ayat kami maka berpalinglah dari mereka hingga mereka mengganti pembicaraan

1722504 banyak dari salafus shalih berkata bahwa al hikmah adalah as sunnah karena sesungguhnya yang dibaca di rumah rumah istri nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mudah mudahan allah meridhai mereka adalah sunnah sunnah nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
1722505 adalah jibril alaihis salam turun kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam membawa as sunnah sebagaimana membawa juga mengajarkan as sunnah itu sebagaimana mengajarkan
1722506 sesungguhnya as sunnah itu adalah syariat yakni apaapa yang disyariatkan allah dan rasul nya dari agama ini

1722534 considero este tipo de expresiones como abusivas e irrespetuosas para la fe de los nicarag enses y el rechazo del clero a las expresiones del mandatario venezolano es un nime
1722535 estoy seguro que nicaragua entera no est tranquila con este tipo de manipulaciones de conceptos religiosos con los que hemos nacido y que utilizamos diariamente para comunicarnos con nuestro dios

1722550 just a quick response to avid collector daniel lobbys disappointment at my post about the new bootleg album
1722551 my comment if its a true bootleg then give us something truly rare was specifically referring to the inclusion of already officially released tracks within the collection
1722552 i do not doubt the rarity value of the oh mercy time out of mind outtakes i was simply questioning the vitality of a new bootleg volume containing a large volume of multi takes
1722553 similarly i have no idea about the quality of items within the dylan vaults i merely suggested it would have been nice for this volume to have followed the successful blueprint of volumes 4 5 and 6 in releasing top notch live collections
1722554 finally i take umbrage at daniels questioning my description the first instalment of the series
1722555 for me as a 16 year old dylan fan at the time it took my breath away it still does even if a lot of the tracks did already exist amongst collectors the majority had never been officially released
1722556 does daniel suggest that the first official release of im not there on the ost was not of interest because the tree with roots genuine basement tapes collections already included it even though the sound quality was a million miles away from the bootlegs
1722557 to my mind the purpose of the bootleg series is not just to offer outtakes and alternative versions

1722602 cuando tuvo lugar la revoluci n en alemania mir con confianza a las universidades pues sab a que siempre se hab an enorgullecido de su devoci n por la causa de la verdad pero las universidades fueron amordazadas entonces confi en los grandes editores de los diarios que proclamaban su amor por la libertad pero al igual que las universidades tambi n ellos tuvieron que callar sofocados en pocas semanas s lo la iglesia permaneci firme en pie para cerrar el camino a las campa as de hitler que pretend an suprimir la verdad antes nunca hab a experimentado un inter s particular por la iglesia pero ahora siento por ella un gran afecto y admiraci n porque la iglesia fue la nica que tuvo la valent a y la constancia para defender la verdad intelectual de la libertad moral

1722617 its really crazy these past couple years are a blur
1722618 when i think about it it feels like its been two months long its run by so fast but at the same time we all have so many different memories of everything thats happened we always think back to when we were playing to 30 kids wondering what would happen in the future if we were going to make it or not
1722619 what we did with the first album was we wanted to get a real following a real hard core following not a radio crowd or anything we wanted to get kids that were really dedicated to us
1722620 we could have put the cd out and that week put a song on the radio
1722621 it would have been no 50 on the charts a few people would have heard it and then no one would have known us theres no foundation to put that on we would have just faded right away
1722622 im sure its going to be obviously a little bit different and probably deeper than the last record
1722623 the last album was all about martins life when he was a teenager and growing up and this will have more to do with this period of his life

1722707 di sisi kami ada nabi yang mengetahui apa yang akan berlaku pada hari esok
1722708 suatu hari rasulullah s a w berada di pintu bilikku ketika itu orang orang habsyah sedang bermain di dalam masjid baginda melindungiku dengan selendangnya agar aku dapat melihat kepada permainan mereka kemudian baginda bangun keranaku sehingga aku beredar bosan kamu andaikan kadar seorang anak gadis yang muda yang berminat dengan hiburan
1722709 allah yang membangkitkan kami agar kami mengeluarkan sesiapa yang dikehendaki nya dari pengabdian sesama hamba menuju pengabdian kepada allah dari kekejaman agama agama kepada keadilan islam dari dunia yang sempit kepada keluasan dunia dan akhirat
1722710 sesungguhnya bumi berada di atas sebiji batu batu tersebut berada di atas tanduk seekor lembu jantan apabila lembu jantan itu menggerakkan tanduknya maka batu tersebut pun bergerak dan bergeraklah bumi itulah gempa bumi
1722711 yang peliknya ada orang yang sanggup menghitamkan buku bukunya dengan perkara perkara merepek ini
1722712 telah berlaku kesalahan sebahagian pengkaji penulis dan penceramah dari kalangan muslimin dalam melihat kisah kisah umat yang lalu di dalam al quran sekalipun dengan niat yang baik namun mereka telah menyanggahi metodologi yang betul dan lurus dalam mengkaji kisah kisah tersebut mereka telah mempersembahkan kepada para pembaca dan pendengar timbunan daripada berbagai pendapat kisah riwayat dan pendetilan kisah kesemuanya tidak lebih dari kisah kisah karut batil palsu yang mereka ambil daripada sumber sumber yang diselewengkan lagi batil ia adalah al israilliyyat dan kisah kisah ahli kitab
1722713 cerita dan sebutan al quran mengenai umat terdahulu kisah kisah dan berita mengenai mereka bukan dengan cara pendetilan huraian al quran tidak mendetilkan tentang masa atau tempat atau watak atau memperincikan cerita tidak diceritakan setiap kejadian atau episodnya atau bahagian bahagiannya ia tidak pula melengkapkan setiap episod mendetil menghuraikan dengan panjang lebar peristiwa peristiwa yang berlaku setiap pergerakan watak wataknya dan latarbelakang peristiwa al quran tidak melakukan ini semua ini kerana bukan tujuan al quran untuk mendetilkan kisah kisah tersebut sebaliknya tujuan al quran untuk membentangkan kebenaran dan menentukan nilaian dan pemikiran mengambil pengiktibaran pengajaran dan panduan juga mengambil manfaat dari panduan panduan yang terdapat dalam kisah kisah tersebut ini semua terlaksana dengan kadar dan cara yang telah dibentangkan oleh al quran para pembaca dan pengkaji al quran yang mengambil riwayat israiliyyat dan cerita cerita dongeng sepatutnya berpegang dengan tujuan al quran bagi kisah kisah umat yang lalu mereka sepatutnya mengambil faedah dari method al quran dalam melihat dan menghuraikan kisah kisah tersebut mereka sepatutnya menumpukan kepada inti panduan dan pengajaran mereka tidak sepatutnya mengambil sumber sumber yang berasal dari manusia yang bersifat lemah dan jahil lalu mereka mencari pendetilan apa yang diterangkan al quran secara umum cuba menjelaskan apa yang al quran samarkan dan menceritakan apa yang al quran diamkan alangkah baiknya jika mereka ini dapat mencari dari sumber yang dipercayai barangkali boleh memberikan mereka ilmu yang dipercayai dalam hal ini malangnya mereka mencari dari sumber yang yang diselewengkan dusta israiliyyat dan mengambil dari manusia kafir lagi zalim yang menyelewengkan agama mereka yahudi
1722714 sesungguhnya antara yang mencemarkan warisan ilmu kita terutamanya di medan tafsir ialah meresapnya israiliyyat dan sukar pula untuk dibersihkan
1722715 seakan akan yahudi ketika tentera mereka tewas di hadapan dakwah islam di madinah khaibar dan selainnya maka mereka cuba menghadapi islam dengan senjata yang lain sebagai ganti kepada kekalahan mereka demikian itu ialah senjata peperangan pemikiran lalu mereka memasukkan riwayat israiliyyat yang pelik pelik dalam kecuaian maka tidak sampai sekejap lalu israiliyyat telah mencekik kitab kitab kaum muslimin
1722716 sesiapa yang memotong pokok bidara maka allah akan rendahkan kepalanya di dalam neraka
1722717 hadis ini diriwayatkan secara ringkas maksudnya sesiapa yang memotong pokok bidara di tanah lapang tanpa sebarang sebab dan sia sia sedangkan ia menjadi tempat berteduh orang bernusafir dan haiwan maka allah rendahkan kepalanya dalam neraka
1722718 ketaatan kepada pemerintah itu wajib selagi tidak disuruh dalam perkara maksiat apabila disuruh dalam perkara maksiat maka tidak perlu dengar dan taat
1722719 takutlah dua perkara perkara yang menyebabkan dilaknat orang sahabat bertanya apakah dua perkara yang menyebabkan dilaknat orang sabda baginda orang yang membuang najis di tengah jalan orang ramai atau tempat teduh mereka
1722720 sesiapa yang memakan bawang putih jangan dia menghampiri masjid kami
1722721 tiap tiap orang diwajibkan beramal dan beribadat sendiri dengan usaha dan tenaganya tidak pernah disuruh ia mengira dirinya itu mesti bergantung kepada doa orang sahaja atau fidyah penebus yang dibuatkan orang sahaja bagi mendapat kejayaan dan keselamatannya di akhirat kelak
1722722 tuhan selalu mencela keras akan orang orang yang hanya mengikut dengan buta tuli sahaja apa yang dikatakan orang atau apa yang biasa dibuat orang umpama mereka yang berdegil mengikut jalan nenek moyang atau pendapat orang dahulu dahulu dengan tiada ditimbang lagi salah benarnya atas neraca timbangan akal sendiri bahkan tiada dikira walaupun berlawanan dengan akal fikiran yang insaf dan bersalahan dengan ilmu pengetahuan yang sah betulnya
1722723 demikianlah dicela tuhan di dalam quran jika orang hanya mengikut apa apa kebiasaan yang telah teradat dari nenek moyang sahaja dengan tiada diperiksa lagi betul atau tidak betulnya dan tiada dijalankan akal fikiran dan pengetahuan sendiri menguji benar salahnya kerana sesungguhnya perbuatan demikian itulah yang dikatakan bertaklid buta bertaklid buta itu dikeji oleh agama dan oleh sekalian orang berakal kerana banyak mudaratnya dan kuat kemungkinannya boleh membawa tersimpang kepada jalan yang tiada betul dengan tiada kita perasan tuhan dan rasulnya tidak menyukai orang orang bertaklid buta kepada fikiran dan pendapat orang lain imam imam mujtahidun dahulu kala tempat orang tertaklid itu sendiri tidak pernah menggemarkan orang orang bertaklid buta sahaja kepadanya atau memastikan orang sekelian menerima sahaja segala fahamannya dan pendapatnya sebaliknya mereka sentiasa menggalakkan murid murid dan pengikut pengikut mereka supaya menyelidik sendiri memeriksa dan menimbang sendiri dengan teliti segala pendapat dan keputusan yang telah mereka peroleh itu
1722724 apabila datang berita kematian jafar bin abi talib nabi s
1722725 buatlah untuk keluarga jafar makanan kerana telah datang perkara yang mengganggu urusan mereka
1722726 tiada seorang pun selepas nabi s a w melainkan boleh diambil dan ditolak pendapatnya kecuali nabi s a w
1722727 kalau ada apa apa perkataan atau pendapatku yang didapati oleh orang orang kemudian bersalahan atau berlawanan dengan hadis sahih nabi s a w maka lemparkanlah ke tembok
1722728 kita semuanya berkehendakkan baik dan tiada siapa yang berkehendakkan jahat
1722729 maka hanyalah pada zaman zaman yang akhir semenjak beberapa ratus tahun yang lalu ini sahaja orang orang alim islam hampir hampir semuanya di serata dunia tidak lagi mempunyai semangat kesendirian kebolehan dan kelayakan untuk berbuat seperti pelopor pelopor mereka yang dahulu kala itu
1722730 sesat dan menyesatkan memandai mandai membawa bidaah mengubah ngubah daripada jalan yang telah diatur oleh pakar pakar dahulu kala itu nenek moyang tidak ada rupa hendak melebih daripada orang dahulu dahulu
1722731 amir al mukminin umar bin al khattab bin nufail bin abd al uzza
1722732 ayat ini adalah dalil bahawa tidak boleh menasabkan seseorang kepada bukan bapanya hadith hadith juga begitu keras menegahnya
1722733 sesiapa yang mengaku anak kepada bukan bapanya maka syurga haram ke atasnya
1722734 antara pendustaan terbesar ialah seseorang mengaku anak kepada bukan bapanya
1722735 keadilan dan hak menuntut dan mewajibkan dinasabkan anak kepada bapanya yang hakiki bukan kepada bapa rekaan islam agama hak dan keadilan sesiapa yang ada bapa yang diketahui maka nasabkan kepada bapanya sesiapa yang tidak diketahui bapanya maka dipanggil maula atau saudara seagama ini semua demi mencegah pengubahan hakikat sebenar
1722736 wajib membinkan anak anak angkat kepada bapanya yang dikenali sekalipun bapanya seekor kaldai
1722737 dan jika kedua ibubapa mendesakmu supaya engkau mensyirikkan denganku sesuatu yang engkau dengan fikiran warasmu tidak mengetahui sungguh adanya maka janganlah engkau taat kepada kedua dan bergaulah dengan mereka di dunia dengan cara yang baik
1722738 sesungguhnya allah meredhai kamu tiga perkara dan memurkai kamu tiga perkara
1722739 tidak dilantik seorang khalifah melainkan akan ada baginya dua bitanah penasihat yang rapat
1722740 kami masuk kepada pemerintah kami lalu kami berkata kepada mereka berbeza dengan apa yang kami cakap apabila kami keluar dari mereka
1722741 kami dahulunya zaman nabi s a w menganggap itu sebagai nifaq perbuatan munafiq riwayat al bukhari 6 2626
1722742 wahai amir al mukminin andainya engkau bersahabat dengan orang yang menjadikan engkau rasa takut sehingga engkau merasa aman lebih baik dari engkau bersahabat dengan orang yang menjadi engkau rasa aman sehingga menyebabkan engkau mendapat ketakutan
1722743 kamu kaum keluarga nabi diampunkan dosa kamu kamulah kerabat nabi
1722744 kata para ulama tidak gugur dari mukallaf tanggungjawab al amr bi wa al nahy an al munkar hanya kerana pada sangkaan tidak memberi faedah bahkan wajib dia melakukannya kerana peringatan itu memberi manfaat kepada orang beriman
1722745 bukan dari manhaj al salaf jalan salafussoleh menghebohkan dan menyebut keburukan pemerintah di atas mimbar hal ini kerana ia boleh membawa kepada porak peranda dan hilang ketaatan dalam perkara makruf ia membawa kekecohan yang memberi mudarat dan tidak bermanfaat sebaliknya jalan yang ikuti di sisi golongan salaf nasihat antara mereka dengan pemerintah menulis kepada mereka atau berhubung dengan ulama yang mempunyai hubungan dengan mereka
1722746 mereka yang paling utama untuk melakukan nasihat kepada para pemerintah ialah ulama cerdik pandai dan ahli mesyuarat pemerintahan firman allah maksudnya dan apabila datang kepada mereka sesuatu berita mengenai keamanan atau kecemasan mereka terus menghebahkannya padahal kalau mereka kembalikan sahaja hal itu kepada rasulullah dan kepada uli al amr di antara mereka tentulah hal itu dapat diketahui oleh orang orang yang layak mengambil keputusan al nisa 83 bukan setiap individu layak untuk urusan ini bukanlah sama sekali menghebah dan menghebohkan kesalahan itu suatu nasihat ia bukan manhaj al salaf al salih sekalipun maksud pelakunya itu baik iaitu untuk membantah munkar seperti yang mereka dakwa namun apa yang dia buat lebih munkar dibandingkan apa yang dia bantah sebabnya boleh jadi membantah munkar itu juga suatu kemunkaran ini sekiranya tidak di atas jalan yang disyariatkan allah dan rasulnya maka ia adalah munkar
1722747 pergilah kamu berdua kepada firaun sesungguhnya ia telah melampaui batas kemudian hendaklah kamu berkata kepadanya dengan kata kata yang lembut mudah mudahan dia beringat atau takut
1722748 dan mereka berkata kami tidak sekali kali akan beriman kepadamu wahai muhammad sehingga engkau memancarkan bagi kami matair dari bumi
1722749 maha suci tuhanku bukankah aku ini hanya seorang manusia yang menjadi rasul
1722750 teruknya orang islam mati macam macam jadi kita yang awak katakan cakap kafir pun tidak jadi macam itu kalau macam ini takut kita hendak masuk islam bahaya nanti tuhan selalu marah mati pun tak boleh senang
1722751 jika kamu melihat seseorang menjual atau membeli di masjid maka katakanlah allah tidak akan menguntungkan perniagaanmu
1722752 qussas mereka itu adalah wu azd yang mengadakan majlis majlis untuk memberi nasihat yang mana ianya menyanggahi majlis ilmu mereka memberi nasihat kepada orang ramai dengan berbagai hikayat israiliyyat dan seumpamanya yang tidak ada asal usulnya atau palsu atau apa yang akal orang awam tidak dapat memikirkannya
1722753 tujuan kami ialah untuk menggalakkan orang ramai kepada kebaikan dan menghalang mereka daripada kejahatan
1722754 sesiapa yang berdusta ke atasku dengan sengaja maka siaplah tempat duduknya dalam neraka
1722755 kebanyakan qussas tukang cerita mereka hanya pentingkan orang ramai berkumpul kepada mereka maka mereka pun mencipta hadith apa yang boleh disukai dan membangkitkan jiwa orang ramai menggerakkan perasaan dan memberikan harapan di kalangan para qussas ada yang melakukan itu semua demi untuk memperolehi habuan dan faedah dari pendengar kebanyakan bala datang daripada mereka mereka berdusta kepada nabi s a w dan tidak pula menganggap itu sebagai dosa dan pembohongan peliknya mendukacitakan mereka memperolehi pula telinga telinga yang sudi mendengar membenarkan dan membela mereka ini disebabkan kejahilan orang awam yang tidak mementingkan kajian dan penelitian
1722756 wahai orang orang yang beriman masuklah kamu ke dalam islam secara keseluruhan dan janganlah kamu menurut jejak langkah syaitan sesungguhnya syaitan itu musuh bagi kamu yang terang nyata
1722757 dr adakah saya masuk neraka kerana saya tidak menutup aurat sedangkan saya solat dan melakukan ibadah ibadah yang lain
1722758 adapun orang yang berat timbangan amal baiknya maka ia berada dalam kehidupan yang senang lenang
1722759 dalil dalil al quran dan al sunnah menunjukkan ke neraka

1722761 wahai ikhwan muslimin yang mulia sasaran dakwah al din dan tajdid islami pembaharuan islam itu bukanlah mudah bukanlah tujuan dan tumpuannya untuk menukar kerajaan semata tidak jua untuk mengubah satu suasana politik kepada suasana politik yang lain tidak untuk menyebarkan pengetahuan dan ilmu atau menghadapi buta huruf dan kejahilan atau memerangi pengangguran atau mengubati kecacatan masyarakat dan akhlak atau seumpamanya seperti yang diperjuangkan oleh para pejuang perubahan di barat dan timur sebaliknya ia adalah seruan islam yang merangkumi akidah dan akhlak amalan dan siasah ibadah juga keperibadian diri dan masyarakat ia meliputi akal dan jiwa ruh dan jasad ia bergantung kepada perubahan mendalam dalam hati dan jiwa akidah dan akal ia terpancar dari hati sanubari sebelum terbit dari pena atau helaian buku atau mimbar syarahan ia terlaksana dalam tubuh pendakwah dan kehidupannya sebelum dia menuntut dilaksanakan dalam masyarakat keseluruhannya istimewanya dakwah dan kesungguhan para nabi ialah ketulusan mereka dari memikiran kepentingan kebendaan hasil yang segera mereka tidak mencari dengan dakwah dan jihad mereka melainkan keredhaan allah melaksanakan perintahnya dan menunaikan risalahnya akal dan pemikiran mereka tulus dari amalan untuk dunia mendapat kedudukan menghasilkan kekuatan untuk keluarga dan pengikut memperolehi kerajaan bahkan itu semua tidak pernah terlintas dalam fikiran mereka adapun kerajaan yang tertegak untuk mereka pada waktu mereka dan kekuatan yang diperolehi pada masa itu hanyalah hadiah daripada allah ia sebagai jalan untuk sampai kepada matlamat agama melaksanakan hukum hakamnya mengubah masyarakat dan mengarahkan kehidupan ini seperti firman allah maksud iaitu mereka umat islam yang jika kami berikan mereka kekuasaan memerintah di bumi nescaya mereka mendirikan sembahyang serta memberi zakat dan mereka menyuruh berbuat kebaikan serta melarang dari melakukan kejahatan dan perkara yang mungkar dan ingatlah bagi allah jualah kesudahan segala urusan surah al hajj 41 bukanlah sama sekali kerajaan yang diperolehi itu salah satu dari matlamat mereka bukan jua salah satu dari tujuan mereka tidak jua dari tajuk perbicaraan mereka atau salah satu dari mimpi mereka hanya ia adalah hasil semulajadi untuk dakwah dan jihad sama seperti buah yang merupakan hasil semulajadi dari kesuburan pokok dan kesungguhan pembajaannya
1722762 mestilah bagi dunia arab sebagai dunia islam bebas memiliki sendiri dalam perniagaan harta industri dan pendidikan bangsa mereka tidak boleh memakai melainkan apa yang tumbuh di buminya dan ditenun dengan tangannya sesungguhnya dunia arab tidak dapat dapat memerangi barat jika keadaan memerlukan demikian selagi meraka memerlukan barat dalam soal harta pakaian dan barangan tidak ada pena yang digunakan untuk menandatangani sesuatu perjanjian dengan barat melainkan pena tersebut dibuat di barat tidak ada senjata yang digunakan untuk memerangi barat melainkan senjata itu dibuat di barat sesungguhnya adalah memalukan apabila umat arab tidak dapat mengambil manfaat daripada sumber kekayaan dan kekuatan mereka sendiri adalah memalukan apabila air kehidupan yang mengalir di dalam urat mereka akhirnya sampai ke tubuh orang lain
1722763 kekuatan ekonomi kita terbengkalai kita hidup di bumi allah yang paling strategik paling baik dan subur bumi yang paling banyak galian yang tersimpan dalam perutnya dan kekayaan yang bertebaran di atasnya malangnya kita tidak menggerakkan kekayaan kita tidak bertani di bumi kita tidak menghasilkan keluaran dari bahan galian sedangkan bahan mentahnya dikeluarkan dari bumi kita jadilah kita dalam banyak keadaan pengguna bukan pengeluar pengimpot bukan pengilang kadang kala kita menghasilkan produk yang kita tidak memerlukannya dan kita abai menghasilkan barangan yang sangat kita perlukan kita berbangga dengan memiliki kereta kereta mewah antarabangsa sedang kita tidak tahu untuk membuat basikal sekalipun

1722792 dengan menunaikan solat berjemaah di masjid sebanyak lima kali sehari menjadikan masjid suatu tempat yang penting dalam islam dan kehidupan muslimin
1722793 kewajiban kepadamu adalah jihad kerana itulah adalah pertapaan umatku ibn hibban dan al hakim hadis hasan
1722794 masjid nabi itu adalah madrasah dakwah demikian juga ianya adalah pejabat negara islam
1722795 masjid bukannya tempat ibadat dan solat semata mata bahkan kedudukannya sama seperti kedudukan islam itu sendiri mencakupi berbagai sudut al din politik dan kemasyarakatan
1722796 rasulullah berdiri untuk solat aku bersaf dengan seorang budak yatim di belakang baginda sementara wanita tua berada di belakang kami
1722797 adapun menjadikan saf kanak kanak di belakang lelaki aku tidak dapati melainkan hadis yang daif ini sahaja
1722798 aku mendirikan solat sebagai imam dan aku berhasrat ingin memanjangkannya tiba tiba aku mendengar tangisan bayi maka aku mensegerakan solatku kerana aku tidak suka membebankan ibunya
1722799 suatu hari rasulullah s a w berada di pintu bilikku ketika itu orang orang habsyah sedang bermain di dalam masjid baginda melindungiku dengan selindangnya aku pula melihat kepada permainan mereka

1722802 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
1722803 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
1722804 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing

1722848 the tax amendment before the voters was not so much a request for funds as it was a plea for the means to proceed with a long term conservation plan the plan known as the design for conservation detailed programs that would be instituted services that would be offered facilities that would be built and the types of lands that would be acquired for public use

1722905 the eia writing in early 2007 assumed that oil prices would decline from their 2006 peak that in 2008 the price of crude oil would be around 60 a barrel that it would continue to decline until around 2013 to a low of about 50 a barrel and that the price would then gradually increase to a little under 60 a barrel by 2030 those were the assumptions on which eia concluded that it would not be economically profitable to get most ocs oil out of the ground

1722907 the academy is funded by growers at this time and therefore our efforts are focused mostly on growers their workers and packhouses this includes all growers being commercial export and non export and emergent growers the academy will eventually extend its work to more directly benefit upstream and downstream suppliers as well provided the funding base is broadened accordingly
1722908 with so much effort and funding going into capacity building it is easy to play the numbers game and to say that we train so many people and spent so much money to me what really matters is whether the learners gain knowledge and skills that they can build on in the future and that they can apply in their day to day activities to improve their farming practices and farming operations ultimately benefiting the citrus industry

1722941 all of a sudden there was a major traffic backup
1722942 there were no signs saying which lanes to merge into whether it was construction an accident or anything
1722943 i was frustrated and i could tell other motorists were frustrated as well
1722944 it came to my mind when i finally got through this mess and say that all of this was due to them working on about 50 feet of payment
1722945 and i got to thinking there are thousands of vehicles stuck in this traffic mess i felt that mdot needed to be more responsible and warn motorists
1722946 mdot has to be accountable for something maybe they need to wake up and realize people are not going to take this anymore
1722947 they also told me it was not their policy to reimburse motorists for wasted gasoline because if they did it for one they would have to do it for everyone
1722948 i did give them 30 days on my invoice however the more i think about it i think im going to send them another notice because i presume theyre not going to pay
1722949 well see what happens this is more about principle than anything else
1722950 the reality is where there is construction there will be delays
1722951 clearly the state is not going to be paying for everyone who is slowed down in construction

1722976 given that the us dollar accounted for 41 of total international reserves at the end of 2007 against 17 for euros its fast depreciation makes it a risky asset for holders and could lead to a run from the dollar toward more stable currencies or more stable assets such as gold commodities real estate and safer financial assets

1723039 the issue is that the ds has no reliable storage device thats a huge bummer virtual console games could be played on the ds if the hand held had some built in memory or if it had a memory stick reader like the psp nes snes genesis pc engine etc games of course not n64 it could be done in so many ways the release of official 512mb 1gb nintendo cards a redesign but at this point i dont think that nintendo will make any huge changes until the ds 2 arrives
1723040 nintendo really seems to have missed the boat with wii ds connectivity they could have had an option to use the ds as a rear view mirror for car racing games such as mario kart or a drawing program from the ds to the screen all sorts of cool things
1723041 hell they could have even had a feature to download demos to your ds from the wii isnt this actually available in japan
1723042 such a shame its not too late tho but it should have been done earlier
1723043 i agree with you there dansk its not like the wii or the ds are going anywhere quite yet so the potential is still there but it is a shame that nintendo hasnt made more of a move on this yet
1723044 i like the idea of using the ds to draw something i can see on the big screen with the wii
1723045 just so you know the ds can download demos from the wii and the service is available in europe now too its all on the wiis nintendo channel the trouble is it is updated very infrequently and older stuff is taken down after a short time
1723046 thats where the real missed potential is if you ask me if nintendo updated the nintendo channel with say three demos a week with games that people actually want to play it could be a real hit
1723047 nintendo has never really been a company that does demos perhaps it is time nintendo started to embrace demos and digital delivery in general but i have always felt that part of the magic of a nintendo game is that you have never played it before you buy it
1723048 i rarely have the feeling with a nintendo title that the game has been subject to the design by committee ethos it always feels like whoever made it had a clear and singular vision for it from the start i imagine public beta is a bit of a dirty word s at nintendo hq
1723049 its not like i am against such things but you dont often have an author or an artist handing their book or sculpture over to the public for it to be changed or re chiseled
1723050 back on topic ive said it before and ill say it again give me access to the virtual console on the ds at least for the titles that would make sense on the platform without the need for considerable reworking of the controls
1723051 though i dont deny that some sort of interconnectivity between the two consoles would be pretty cool while playing games i cant help but feel that few people would ever bother to use it
1723052 i suppose with the lack of wires or extra peripherals needed to make it work it makes more sense with the wii and ds than nintendos previous attempts at linking its handheld and home consoles but i just dont know how much it would add to the experience of wii games
1723053 content delivered to your ds via the wii however i am very much behind it makes so much sense for demos virtual console titles wiiware titles etc to be made available to the ds it probably wont ever happen the way we all want it to but isnt that almost always the way with nintendo
1723054 yes but i could have made that on my own without taking clomid

1723075 it has helped me to learn more about the importance of prayer and taught me more about how to pray ive learned a lot about trusting in god for my support and letting him fight my battles it has also encouraged me to be readier to share the gospel and to be bolder in that

1723195 it isnt a surprise that housing arrears have risen dramatically the council should re open the cash offices without delay
1723196 payments through the paypoints are taking four to five working days to reach the rent accounts tenants are falling into arrears even if they pay on time
1723197 yet the council continue to waste time and money unnecessarily producing letters and paying postage telling people they are in arrears when they have paid
1723198 the money owed has increased slightly in recent months the overall percentage for june is in line with the percentage arrears at the end of last financial year
1723199 rents increased in april 2008 and arrears usually go up following a rise tenants are still adjusting to new payment methods
1723200 common calls in portsmouth are to deal with ants or being a coastal city dead seagulls or pigeons in the grounds the number of calls logged reflects the proactive approach adopted by the trust as successful pest control relies on early identification of potential problems
1723201 these figures must be put into context it goes without saying that as the fourth largest trust in the country our hospitals are bigger than most others around the country and therefore our figures should be compared with trusts with similar sized estates rather than smaller acute trusts

1723203 the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1723204 we believe that the evening standards front page story today titled prince philip defies cancer scare is a serious breach of prince philips privacy
1723205 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1723206 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1723207 we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission
1723208 as a trade union balpa has quite rightly fought long and hard to protect the final salary pensions of its pilot members in british airways and other airlines
1723209 balpa is now seeking to close its own final salary pension to new entrants and to impose drastic changes to pension benefits for existing staff
1723210 no employer let alone a trade union should impose changes to terms and conditions of employment without the agreement of its own staff balpa would not tolerate such behaviour from an employer that it was dealing with and the gmb will not tolerate this from balpa
1723211 balpa is extremely disappointed that the gmb has decided to proceed with a strike despite balpa making improved offers and without the gmb even consulting its members on those offers
1723212 we campaign against airlines not only because they have been closing defined benefit pension schemes but they have been imposing very inferior defined contribution schemes for new employees
1723213 balpa has offered new employees a first rate defined contributions scheme which is so good that the gmb negotiators originally recommended it there is a huge difference and it is grossly unfair to accuse balpa of hypocrisy as gmb now does

1723223 iraqs election authorities say there is not enough time to hold important provincial balloting on schedule by october a statement sunday from the election commission proposes moving the voting from october 1st to late december
1723224 iraqs electoral commission said on sunday time was running out to hold provincial elections this year because of parliaments delay in passing legislation needed for the poll
1723225 we need at least three months after the law is passed to prepare so polling can be up to international standards even if the law is passed in the coming days we will only be able to vote at the end of the year any more delay and we wont be able to have elections this year

1723298 a day in the life of jill an agency er
1723299 we work with some of the best and brightest companies in the u
1723300 jill did you search on google to learn more about ibm db2 and what it is if you keep asking about html and microsoft word experience youre going to keep getting hang ups by the way what is your big mission today how about your little mission
1723301 we dont care if you know technology or not were just looking for people who can sell
1723302 my big mission is to recruit an html programmer my 2nd big mission is to let you know 5 companies that are hiring by asking my candidates where theyre interviewing i know that this is the information you need so you can call them and get the job order my minor mission is to find out where john smith is now working by getting more references from my candidates
1723303 great jill i really need to find out those companies that are hiring where you can tell your candidate that they shouldnt take the job there this way we have a better chance of getting one of our candidates in there due to the fee well make for the placement also give me any references with the title manager director vp or above this is how we get business you must do everything you can to find out the names of the people doing the interviewing at the places your candidates are trying to get jobs this is one of the keys to our business the faster you learn how to get what you want out of candidates the faster youll be on your way to being a big biller like your co worker john
1723304 remember cold calling is all about being motivated make the candidate say no at least 3 times and if they do you just have to remember that the average here is 500 nos to get a yes that means that you technically make 1 every time somebody says no ok get fired up and hit those phones
1723305 hi mr candidate my name is jill and i work with z staff have you heard of z staff oh you havent wow i cant belive it were only the largest staffing firm specializing in blah blah blah so the reason im calling today mr candidate is because someone told me youre great with html and that you have made websites with ibm db2 too is that true
1723306 mr candidate were not like the other staffing firms out there we want to build a relationship with you and thats why we bring everyone in and meet them face to face after you give me your references i will do a check and find out if we have anything for you if not ill put you in my database and call you if i find a match yes i know it took you an hour to drive out here but isnt your future worth a few hours in the car by the way who did you say you interviewed with over at widget company
1723307 we work with widget company all the time did you meet with mr orange over there
1723308 but jill you mean were done i thought you had a position in mind when you called me yesterday afternoon to set up this mornings face to face interview
1723309 oh yeah that position i forgot to tell you that the position was filled about 2 minutes after i got off the phone with you yesterday but i was so impressed by your verbal presentation that i just had to meet you but please dont worry youre in our database now and we have new positions all the time just be sure to email me back the reference sheet as we dont represent any candidates that we havent reference checked as soon as i do that i will approve your profile in our system
1723310 if they dont know we went together i can say that i went to meet a candidate for lunch and charge back all the expenses for our lunch today i can even charge them back for the gas mileage to get here
1723311 look jill you have to look out for yourself i mean youre paying them 60 of every deal you make so you might as well learn how to play the game to get some of that money back
1723312 just make up a candidate that sounds like theyd be a super fit
1723313 wow wed like to speak with this candidate by the way are you new at z staff i never know who is still working there or not
1723314 hi mr client this is manager mike of z staff can i help you sure we will send that candidate in for an interview asap right after you sign this fee agreement entitling us to 45 of the first years base
1723315 just dont send your best candidates there we have others that are willing to pay 40 so they get first dibs on the best people regardless of match
1723316 so have you been an html programming for a while now
1723317 youre coming along nicely jill but remember this business isnt about making friends its about making placements by the end of the day let me know how many submittals you have for next week
1723318 everyone you need to keep in your mind all day every day exactly what is closest to the money
1723319 the point wasnt to place the candidate you marketed to them this morning because that candidate doesnt even exist the point is to get the business and then work hard to fill the job be sure to let them know that we have other much stronger candidates so there is no reason to worry
1723320 lying how could that be lying youre trying to help them fill a need
1723321 jill i already have 5 great candidates for that position so dont even bother recruiting on it i already have it covered besides that was my client company from 2 years ago and this placement is going to get me on the top performer trip this year
1723322 manager mike i have 3 great candidates that are in the low end of the range but im going to sell the most expensive candidate as hard as i can so we make a higher fee with the placement
1723323 look jill this isnt in the rules of engagement manual but its an unwritten principle that you dont call any candidates unless one of us hasnt spoken to them in more than 30 days this is especially true for a top performer like me nobody steps on my toes i called that candidate 29 days ago so theyre still mine you have to turn the deal over to me as its my commission the bottom line is that jimmy is my candidate not yours
1723324 but manager mike they wouldnt give me the specifics on the names i know you told me to not let them leave until i got this information but i had some tough candidates today one candidate even got up and walked out and i had a feeling i was going to get in trouble for that
1723325 look i hear these excuses from new people all the time jill not everybody is cut out for this business so you have to think about it real hard if you want to become a z staff top performer
1723326 im your new account manager as weve upgraded the importance of your account to z staff
1723327 is this the way that the supposed z staff top performers act

1723343 you are not to speak of imposition when we do it little man
1723344 this infantalizes iraqis and as kahl would surely note demands nothing of them since it is american decisions and will which matter and not theirs

1723351 the match confidence is never there when you play after a long time
1723352 they need to play to get noticed there are more places in the midfield than up front
1723353 i struggled with injuries last season but now i am completely fit and would look for more games
1723354 we need the coaches to be more proactive instead of signing two foreigners as strikers and one midfielder or defender they can have one foreign defender midfielder and striker and give one indian striker a chance in every game
1723355 apart from bhaichung and sunil chhetri there is no indian striker who gets a regular start in any of the clubs

1723363 but we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
1723364 ill be a president that stands up for american families all of them
1723365 difficile dirlo a giudicare dallultimo campionato sembra di s lui ne ha fatti tanti io sedici quindi a livello di gol penso che ci saremmo la differenza che ora siamo in una categoria superiore che io non ho mai fatto per questo faccio fatica a rispondere marazzina invece in a ha gi giocato e di gol ne ha fatti parte in vantaggio rispetto a me sicuramente con pi esperienza per fin da quando ho iniziato a giocare da bambino il mio sogno era giocare in serie a ora che ci sono arrivato dar tutto me stesso come ho sempre fatto con una motivazione in pi perch voglio vedere se in a ci posso stare anchio sicuramente porto al bologna il mio entusiasmo la mia voglia di giocare in a che il mio sogno
1723366 sinceramente non ho paure il calcio per me sempre stato un divertimento e anche adesso lo vedo pi come un divertimento che come un lavoro poi naturale che hai anche grosse responsabilit specie quando giochi in piazze importanti ma di paure non ne ho cerco di affrontare le partite dando tutto quello che ho e poi vedremo
1723367 anchio nel mio piccolo sono uno che si lamenta abbastanza per devo dire che fino adesso ci siamo trovati bene sia in campo che in spogliatoio se uno parla per il bene della squadra in modo costruttivo secondo me buono e io in queste settimane ho sempre visto positivo latteggiamento di marazzina
1723368 s perch non ci ho mai giocato tutti gli esordienti sono un po una scommessa io ho dimostrato di poter giocare in serie b ma per me la a una novit e posso essere ritenuto una scommessa penso di poter far bene ma non so fino a che punto ho voglia di misurarmi poi tireremo le somme pi avanti
1723369 non mi spaventa anzi mi fa piacere lui poi nel giro di un paio danni cresciuto tanto e non so se io potr diventare forte quanto lui essere una sua brutta copia sarebbe gi molto positivo sono alto e qualche palla di testa la prendo ma mi piace molto anche giocare con i piedi e far salire la squadra tenendo la palla in avanti poi non ho la sua forza e la sua potenza con laiuto dellallenatore stiamo studiando movimenti diversi per cercare di non andare troppo a contatto col difensore margini di miglioramento penso che ce ne siano sempre come ho visto in questi ultimi anni quando avendo giocato con una certa continuit credo di essere cresciuto abbastanza difficile stabilire dove siano questi margini preferisco che mi dicano gli altri dove devo migliorare e sicuramente ci lavorer sopra
1723370 la squadra a cui ho segnato di pi penso sia proprio il cesena dove ho giocato per anni quando giochi dai tutto per la tua squadra per la societ che ti paga per questo
1723371 sono questioni che riguardano la societ valuteranno loro che tipo di punta prendere per affrontare un campionato di serie a serve un determinato numero di punte e tutti noi saremo contenti se arriver un giocatore di livello che possa far fare un salto di qualit alla squadra un attaccante che fa gol fa comodo a tutte le squadre e anche a me farebbe piacere se arrivasse vivo bene la competizione non ho nessun problema a dovermi guadagnare il posto e lottare per una maglia anzi penso sia molto bello e stimolante
1723372 ce ne sono tanti il mio preferito luca toni che per ora gioca in bundesliga in serie a da totti a trezeguet ci sono tantissimi attaccanti forti

1723397 toen ik het relaas zorgvuldig nalas en merkte hoe dikwijls de schrijver verwees naar het vasten van hannah viel me plotseling te binnen dat ze waarschijnlijk aan anorexia leed
1723398 nee meneer antwoordt hannah ik ben alleen maar een vrouw die geestelijk in de war is ik heb geen wijn of bier gedronken maar ik heb mijn hart uitgestort bij de almachtige god een verdorven vrouw ben ik zeker niet ik heb gewoon mijn zorgen en leed aan de voeten van de heer gelegd dan antwoordt eli ga in vrede en moge de god van israel je bede verhoren hannah vervolgt haar weg ze begint terug te eten en is niet langer neerslachtig
1723399 dit verhaal leert ons heel veel over dingen die vandaag nog steeds gelden
1723400 het geeft een expliciete beschrijving van het verdriet dat gepaard gaat met onvruchtbaarheid hoe ongelukkig hannah is in weerwil van de liefde van haar man
1723401 we zien ook dat anorexia dat doorgaans als een hedendaags probleem wordt beschouwd misschien 2500 jaar geleden al bestond
1723402 de talrijke verwijzingen van de schrijver naar het feit dat hannah weigerde om te eten suggereren dat het hier om een ongewoon fenomeen ging
1723403 in zowat 28 verzen heeft de opmerkzame schrijver genoeg details verwerkt om ons 25 eeuwen later tot de juiste conclusies te leiden

1723408 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas

1723567 dieses urteil best tigt uns in unserer rechtsauffassung die wir in den vergangenen monaten immer wieder vertreten haben
1723568 wir konnten daher das verhalten und die aussagen verschiedenster fifa verantwortlicher nicht nachvollziehen die fifa ist mit dem versuch gescheitert bestehende paragraphen auszuhebeln und neues recht zu schaffen es war unsere pflicht uns gegen diese willk r zur wehr zu setzen
1723569 nach dieser langen vorgeschichte wird auch jetzt keine partei mehr gl cklich durch den zeitverzug der durch das hinausz gern einer klaren entscheidung eingetreten ist finden wir eine unm gliche situation vor wir m ssen jetzt einen tag vor dem start des olympischen turniers und drei tage vor dem beginn unserer pflichtspielsaison entscheiden ob wir diego wieder aus china zur ckholen
1723570 sie mussten durch den kurs der fifa von einer abstellungspflicht ausgehen und standen zudem unter einem enormen moralischen druck seitens des brasilianischen fu ballverbandes cbf
1723571 diego wird f r die dauer des verbleibs der brasilianischen olympia auswahl im turnier f r die olympischen spiele abgestellt wenn der brasilianische fu ballverband kurzfristig die rahmenbedingungen f r seine teilnahme schafft
1723572 wir haben uns auch in diesem jahr in allen wettbewerben viel vorgenommen und h tten gern f r den start im dfb pokal und den ersten beiden bundesliga spielen unsere bestm gliche mannschaft auf dem platz gehabt allerdings ist die vorbereitung auf diese spiele die durch den rechtsstreit weitgehend ohne diego durchgef hrt werden musste so weit fortgeschritten dass eine r ckholaktion zum jetzigen zeitpunkt sportlich keinen sinn mehr machen w rde
1723573 wir haben das thema fr h genug auf den tisch der fifa gebracht wir haben jedoch den eindruck gewonnen dass die angelegenheit bewusst bis zum start der olympischen spiele verz gert wurde um die vereine in die nun bestehende lage zu man vrieren
1723574 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years

1723581 yes the bush administration launched a war over what it claimed was the possession of nuclear weapons by iraq although in fact iraq didnt possess any and today is taking a very hard line toward iran which also does not possess them and might not even be developing them but in defiance of the disarmament commitment of the nuclear powers the president seems thoroughly comfortable with his own command of some 10 000 nuclear weapons and his proposals for more now theres pressure to get back on track toward a nuclear free world peace and disarmament organizations of course have long championed nuclear abolition and continue to do so but they have now been joined by an important segment of the foreign and defense policy establishment

1723587 consumers are willing to pay to watch new movies at home and content producers are willing to transmit them but government is standing in the way
1723588 but content owners arent required to ensure that all movies can be easily timeshifted and archived

1723591 like a spy behind enemy lines i arrived every day at my mid manhattan office and sat at my computer terminal checking the reuters machine that blinked bright emerald messages from across the globe
1723592 sometimes coming out of an interview with japanese financiers or german bond traders i would catch my reflection in the elevator doors see myself in a suit and tie a briefcase in my hand and for a split second i would imagine myself as a captain of industry
1723593 he always seemed aloof a little bit of a stray cat
1723594 its a green school and if we can use it its the right thing to do
1723595 this began as a book about farming in southeast minnesota but it became a story of agriculture not only here but globally
1723596 everything is connected now what the world trade organization does in geneva affects the farmer in altura olivia and wadena
1723597 its clear that more and more farmers are shifting to more sustainable practices
1723598 in 2050 the small farmer with 80 cows and no vet bills thats the ones that will survive you need to have healthy soil healthy animals and healthy humans to get there
1723599 there are a lot of factoids out there some of which are true some of which are not true
1723600 theres been to put it mildly some bad blood between the army and the local community
1723601 it will provide a meaningful addition so we can get a larger more modernized training facility
1723602 i dont have to tell you the army has not spent a whole lot of money down here
1723603 with this expansion its 5 million for las animas county but its 500 million for el paso county
1723604 if you think youre going to get a key to the city youll have a long wait

1723609 we can be a positive impact for the whole country
1723610 its amazing you dont have to work at all you just walk to the mailbox and there it is
1723611 the continual amount of oil in north dakota is three times as much as texas
1723612 were doing as much as we can to try and get it out
1723613 im fairly certain that if they drilled a well here theyd have oil
1723614 they just need to perfect how to get it out
1723615 i think we can be a positive impact for the whole country if we can figure this out
1723616 we have a real housing shortage at this time but eventually itll be ok
1723617 its a good challenge its better than going the other way
1723618 my biggest concern today is making sure our infrastructure is adequate for the growth that wed like to maintain
1723619 id have said you were crazy it wouldnt come to pass
1723620 its just kind of difficult to change a pattern of living
1723621 were old enough now so we dont have great desires for bigger and better
1723622 its kind of sad for them because they went through life and never got it and now its coming
1723623 i cant get tired of that i just grin all the way to it and back
1723624 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1723625 there really isnt anything out there on the horizon thats going to change the economic landscape in a meaningful way
1723626 consumers are likely to be very concerned about the economy come election day
1723627 when the economy is bad it tends to favor the party thats out of power

1723631 il governo sta programmando la perdita del potere di acquisto di 3 milioni e mezzo di dipendenti pubblici
1723632 quanto previsto nella manovra osserva gentile e probabilmente confermato nella legge finanziaria rappresenterebbe solo quanto necessario per coprire linflazione programmata 1 7 per il 2008 e 1 5 per il 2009 quando allo stesso tempo il governo certifica che a fine 2008 linflazione sar pari al 3 4

1723634 people are just cruel this is bad karma for him
1723635 todays announcement represents an innovative approach to the r amp d productivity challenges our pharmaceutical clients are facing
1723636 covance will invest in this facility and maximize its capacity utilization by conducting substantial work with lilly and bring in new work from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients we expect the greenfield site to be a key contributor to the future growth and success of covance
1723637 through these roles william has gained the respect and confidence of the dia staff the board of directors and association members enabling him to ensure seamless operations during this transition period
1723638 in its critical path initiative the fda identified correctly we believe the need for this country to make significant improvements to the process under which new drugs are developed
1723639 by adding a department of translational medicine we hope to play an integral role in the process of moving research discoveries from the laboratory into clinical practice more rapidly
1723640 the remarkable growth in our biomarkers business areas led us to consider this path
1723641 qps considers the creation of a translational medicine department pivotal to providing new technologies to support preclinical and clinical drug development worldwide
1723642 dr chen is a founding member of our molecular biology group and has established very diverse capabilities within a short period of time
1723643 she is a determined leader with a great deal of entrepreneurial spirit and i have every reason to believe in the success of our new venture
1723644 education is the most powerful ally of humanism and every american public school is a school of humanism what can the theistic sunday school meeting for an hour once a week and teaching only a fraction of the children do to stem the tide of a five day program of humanistic teaching
1723645 i am convinced that the battle for humankinds future must be waged and won in the public school classroom by teachers that correctly perceive their role as proselytizers of a new faith a religion of humanity that recognizes and respects the spark of what theologians call divinity in every human being the classroom must and will become an arena of conflict between the old and new the rotting corpse of christianity together with all its adjacent evils and misery and the new faith of humanism resplendent with the promise of a world in which the never realized christian ideal of love thy neighbor will finally be achieved
1723646 let me control the textbooks and i will control the state
1723647 well take men and women who have been displaced who want to take a significant step to improve their lives after any kind of traumatic effect
1723648 we know were not going to sell the building over night
1723649 theres never been anything like it here because of the grounds
1723650 and its going to have amenities like a country club would
1723651 we did partner up with the community to take downtown to the next level i think its going to be an exciting downtown for this city for a long time to come
1723652 i understand its progress and it brings a lot to our economy but at the same time you kind of drag your feet and youre a little nostalgic for the way it always has been
1723653 in terms of drawing new businesses downtown and making a more urban environment its great
1723654 we certainly dont want the lawsuit or court order to prejudice any of the sales of the unsold units
1723655 a lawsuit may affect the financial stability of the property
1723656 was in fact a forgery and has never been registered against the eldorado property
1723657 younger canadians who bought condos as their first step into the housing markets have grown accustomed to the numerous benefits of the condo lifestyle and many are considering extending them into the next phase of their lives
1723658 home buyers were snapping up a new condo every four minutes the sales offices were open
1723659 frankly we never thought wed see the day when low rise product would represent the minority of our sales particularly to this extent
1723660 sometimes it takes a project affecting folks who can get things done to actually get things done
1723661 we are fortunate that we have residents who do have the ear of influential people
1723662 no adverse traffic impact on the area street system nor the neighborhood i am granting our approval of the traffic impact analysis of 1717 bissonnet
1723663 it would be speculation for us to try to suggest why exactly that happened
1723664 use any appropriate power under law to alter the proposed project as currently planned
1723665 the city said there were standards that we set that the developers followed
1723666 how can this community southampton push the envelope so much
1723667 if we dont come up with some intelligent way to deal with density were going to have chaos
1723668 rusty has been engaged by our community to pursue all of the legal options that our neighborhoods can use to stop the proposed development
1723669 she had a bunch of meetings and things planned for fashion week including meetings for her own line but shes postponed everything
1723670 shes completely thrilled this is something shes wanted for a very long time
1723671 we need to look at this project and see whether it can be scaled down
1723672 lets talk to the developers and do something thats more in keeping with this neighborhood
1723673 they came in under budget on time and were very popular
1723674 alliance has been great to work with and were looking at more projects to do with them
1723675 our typical building program in houston is to do one to two projects a year with the typical project running between 300 and 400 units
1723676 there is a strong reluctance on the part of many in the community to infringe on property rights
1723677 but that tower in the middle of southampton is going to influence every building around it just like someone who lights a cigarette in a restaurant has an impact on the people around him
1723678 we need to look at these more comprehensively and collectively
1723679 we have invested an enormous amount of human and financial resources
1723680 there will be a shadow on their property every hour of every day all year long
1723681 i think well start off with the power of persuasion
1723682 most developers want to have good relationships with city hall and they realize there are consequences to being unpopular
1723683 houstons city charter prevents the city from dictating references to landowners concerning the residential or commercial use
1723684 i believe the city does have the power to limit or to impose reasonable requirements concerning on site parking flood impacts the amount of traffic or trips and the reasonableness of places for ingress and egress on a particular property
1723685 the stock averages closed at or near their resistance levels
1723686 this may cause some further consolidation before breaking through to the upside
1723687 you have to be a cpa to understand what he just said
1723688 you have to be a jew to understand what that jew just said
1723689 the fact of the matter is the plan is so complex that the ordinary american is never going to ever figure out what they even qualify for
1723690 rather pathetic how about you try and get a life
1723691 the preliminary leasing numbers for the third quarter are looking a little better than what we saw earlier in the year
1723692 we are already getting calls from potential renters and we put their names on a list and hope they will be around when we finish next summer
1723693 the rents are going to range from 1 60 per square foot on the low end to hopefully over two bucks on some of the high end units
1723694 we are planning for this projects design to be a little edgier than the others we are doing
1723695 as long as thats going on developers will be bullish about dallas
1723696 with the fallout from the mortgage market it should be somewhat positive for our industry
1723697 the credit crunch will get them some tenants because thats whats hit the condo market
1723698 we have three properties leasing right now and a couple of them have been fairly slow specifically the one downtown
1723699 we knew thered be some growing pains with so much product coming on line
1723700 there are only so many renters you can capture downtown in a specific period of time
1723701 ive seen that written about in a few places and we are certainly looking forward to some benefit from that
1723702 on our existing portfolio as of the second quarter we had an effective rent growth of almost 4 percent
1723703 rediscovering play bringing fun and passion to your work and your life
1723704 i will be prepared to use any appropriate power under the law to alter the proposed project
1723705 i have no idea whether that will stop the project or not but we certainly hope so
1723706 you get to hear what the world without any interference is like
1723707 i had no idea it was here and one day i discovered it was a wonderful place to go walking
1723708 what weve found is why go for a hike in the mountains when five minutes away will put you a long way away from the city
1723709 its a sense of place its hard to give that when you live in a world of buildings roads and parking lots many people dont even have backyards
1723710 there seems to be an eco phobia people are afraid to be out in the bush
1723711 thats how we spent our childhoods but were training our children the bush is a scary and unsafe place
1723712 in some places in the valley its like pick up sticks
1723713 theres one species thats more invasive and that walks on two legs
1723714 kids playing in the bush was all about making up stories building forts and using your imagination
1723715 its how you proved yourself its how you developed arm muscles
1723716 instead for adventure kids turn to drugs or racing cars on the road
1723717 at the foot of the ravine everything changes its the key stretch for spawning
1723718 its hard to determine the best balance between loving it to death and not knowing it exists
1723719 you need to think about your positioning in relation to the speakers
1723720 sit in a comfortable seat without any distractions but most importantly close your eyes your brain becomes much more attuned to what youre hearing if you just focus on the one sense
1723721 you should be able to pick out these details in good recordings
1723722 and when you can it becomes more interesting more entertaining now if you go back to your own music collection youll be able to hear it in new and different ways
1723723 its just that you might not be hearing all the things that were originally put into it
1723724 today its all about convenience rather than quality its about having 1 000 albums in your pocket people have forgotten the benefits of making the act of listening into an event
1723725 id go for a bottom of the range model by a high end speaker company rather than the other way round purely because the quality always filters down through the range and i swear by sennheisers hd600 headphones either at home or in the studio
1723726 the key is to match up all the parts of your system
1723727 if you buy a 600 amplifier theres no point in hooking up 20 speakers to it
1723728 anyone who forks out 6 000 for a cd player is doing it purely for status
1723729 especially so if theyre over 21 as theyll have already lost 20 per cent of their hearing theyre not going to appreciate it
1723730 audiophiles have developed incredibly acute some might say irrelevant but certainly very impressive auditory skills they can hear all kinds of details that the rest of us cant its as if theyve taught themselves to become irritated by poor audio quality
1723731 of course not research has shown that a fairly poor auditory signal can trigger the same emotional response and the more familiar you are with the music the lower quality you actually need for your brain to be able to recapture a sense of the original
1723732 you need to think about your positioning in relation to the speakers

1723745 ja weet ik niet had gister iets vet vaags mee gemaakt kwam een man tegen op het station en een paar seconde later was hij weer verdwenen
1723746 haha wat heb jij gisteren gesmoked ik wil het ook haha
1723747 these are a lot more than places for people to store their cars
1723748 people will be able to express their personalities in each garage
1723749 about a third of them that come in just want a man cave
1723750 were talking about what kind of stone we want or about custom made wrought iron doors
1723751 were kind of like a bunch of ladies sitting around and talking about fabrics but instead its guys
1723752 we have every intention of being at the auction and controlling that land
1723753 it is one of the most desirable locations in the state and we are very excited that an auction date has been set
1723754 i cant confirm if we will participate in the auction
1723755 i can confirm that with our investment in desert ridge and citynorth we continue to be interested in any new opportunities in northeast phoenix
1723756 this is a great opportunity to develop a mixed use property
1723757 ja ik heb spul nodig om me tattoo te verzorgen geen idee wat het moet zijn maar het moet vet zijn als ik het goed heb begrepen
1723758 ok dat gaat wel lukken als je zover ben kom je maar binnen
1723759 aah dat komt door de adrinaline dat trekt zo wel weer weg
1723760 zo die staat erop wat vind je er van geworden
1723761 our sights were drawn to this bright spot which is becoming the nexus of growth in north texas
1723762 it is important to balance both development and preservation of the towns character and quality of life as it matures
1723763 pdr has been a valued customer of ours for three years
1723764 compass bank is committed to supporting our developer clients in the southwest real estate market and we are excited about the tremendous potential the mckinney ranch community offers in its position for steady growth
1723765 theres pretty much a 60 day window at this point whether it will happen or it wont
1723766 emphasizes the discovery of the evolutionary patterns of behavior within literary texts the iliad in terms of dominance and aggression or jane austen in terms of mating rituals and sets itself firmly against 30 years of what they see as anti scientific literary theories like poststructuralism and marxism
1723767 most of the big ideas in literary theory have been tried out and rejected in other disciplines so psychoanalysis has no life in psychology anymore it only exists in the humanities marxism has no life really in political theory or in economics classrooms
1723768 my point is we start with these bad theories and work founded on faulty premises is going to be faulty itself
1723769 sees literary darwinism as a force that could add to the joblessness and hopelessness of students and professors instead of vice versa
1723770 say i am a professor of english i have graduate students and i tell them you have to forget about everything that your colleagues have been working on for the last 30 years because its all literary theory its all wrong and now you have this new scientific approach that you use now let me ask you what would happen if a graduate student who hears this goes on the job market
1723771 the hines u s office value added fund looks for assets to buy at the right time and adds value through leasing selling it at the right time and this property fit the funds parameters
1723772 houston is definitely doing very well and is coming into its own as an international city this is definitely a trophy property and one of the crown jewels in downtown houston
1723773 in the last 18 months 75 percent of the class a property in downtown houston has sold or is being sold that is a huge number that no one has ever seen before
1723774 it is located in the dead center of downtown in a very central location
1723775 the architecture is magnificent and it will be another skyline structure we just recently completed the assemblage of the land and are moving forward
1723776 violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1723777 for us the serious issue is peace for us the serious issue is militants sanctuaries in tribal areas as long as they remain peace will not return to the area

1723803 when the two left together ed was leading her by the hand he was moving quick but he had time to wink at a hot brunette before slipping out
1723804 there is a preference right now for many people to live in high rise structures
1723805 thats not all bad that can be good for the city
1723806 i dont know it could create some problems in the village but its going to happen so the question for us its a nice place do we want to live there or not
1723807 woodson said the lights prevent him from enjoying his life the main thing is the ambiance is lost
1723808 whatever mood i wanted to create just have nice jazz music on when i come home or just want to relax ive got to deal with lights shining into my place into my face 24 7
1723809 to put some kind of skin or mesh on the building to block the illumination from the garage lights
1723810 theyre not exactly right in my face but still i dont need a full moon anymore
1723811 i have a permanent one i really appreciate a nice view of the city but with those lights on pretty much part of the view is already masked with the lights
1723812 were seeing a wide range of people coming into the downtown residential market mostly single double income retirees and empty nesters
1723813 sales are going strong and our interest list is growing
1723814 the hotel condo aspect is what sets us apart from others people are attracted to luxury living with a simplicity of life we offer from the hotels concierge service to housekeeping to valet parking all at the touch of your fingertips its a new way of living in fort worth
1723815 our condos and hotel will bring more vibrancy into the area anchor that end of town and establish more business opportunities for the whole of downtown
1723816 both the omni and the texas amp pacific lofts will breathe life back into the southern end of downtown where its been still and quiet for decades
1723817 all these investments are adding critical mass to the area as envisioned by the developers and the city
1723818 virtually all of the development being done is very high end so were encouraging more affordable housing
1723819 were becoming more family friendly but the question is how long will they stay
1723820 an affordable living incentive component is now in place by the city were being proactive to make sure we have a well rounded urban neighborhood
1723821 myself mentioned four sixty fourmo and seven years no more
1723822 theres not enough street access to handle the traffic of the people who are going to be living in the high rise
1723823 its going to block the sun from houses its way too high for where it is it should be on a major thoroughfare
1723824 i think we have the support of the mayor several council people and i think with the support of the neighborhood we can make something happen here
1723825 release date amp prices announced clear your diaries for the 18th sept

1723828 when you wear a garment say a t shirt put it away on the top of the t shirt pile over a few weeks the good 20 will be the top 20 of the pile so remove the bottom ranks to boxes for storage sale or consignment do the same with jeans bras underpants anything that stacks for hanging clothes simply replace all useful clothing to one side and weed weeks later from the other

1724381 they told me frankly they were not opposed to some sort of realignment

1724413 affiliate payload affiliate marketing based and by looking over what he has shown me so far it looks pretty good now i know that 4 tier annihilation method wasnt all that great and maybe his worst to date but i do give him credit for trying to show people how to make money in ways that dont have to do with affiliate marketing in fact this looks pretty damn in depth but this one is affiliate marketing as well as few other things i could go over whats in it exactly but he specifically said lease keep this for your eyes only the final version will be edited and greatly added to keep in mind that most of the headings below are in themselves huge sections that contain many techniques to cash in on offers and are very very detailed in the course
1724414 also the defense needed to be rebuilt and we think were on the way to getting that done
1724415 but we think hes going to be good hell need a little more time his shot and his speed are two of his biggest strengths we like the package hes a pretty well rounded package at both ends of the ice
1724416 he was very impressive when he was in los angeles and had a good first pro season hell have a chance to make the roster this season
1724417 he had a tremendous first season coming out of college
1724418 hes got good size and good hands he has to get a little stronger but he should contend for a roster spot this year
1724419 he probably needs another year in juniors but he has the skill to compensate for his lack of size
1724420 he goes to the net and does the dirty work hes made himself into a prospect coming out of cornell he was impressive in his time with us last season and hell have a shot at a job in the fall
1724421 hes got to learn how to be a pro but it looks like he has the chance to be a really elite player we have spots available so we will see where hes at were not going to promise anything either way but hell have a chance to come in and earn a job
1724422 he moves the puck well theres no guarantee hell make the team but he has a chance we have some holes back there with thomas its just a matter of adding maturity to his game like most young guys he needs to get bigger and stronger but overall we really like the package he brings
1724423 he has to fill out a little bit but hell provide some toughness which is something we havent always had
1724424 hes not the biggest guy but he plays with a lot of heart
1724425 he can move the puck and generate offense he did ok when he was here and hes been really solid at manchester we want to see more of him
1724426 we dont want to rush him but we have high expectations for jonathan
1724427 hes got the skills to be an elite goaltender hes a very athletic goaltender with good quickness and hes very willing to learn
1724428 he was actually better in los angeles than he was in the minors he came up at the end of the season when we werent really playing for anything and played well
1724429 he was actually better in los angeles than he was in the minors
1724430 he came up at the end of the season when we werent really playing for anything and played well
1724431 we still think of him as a prospect though hes probably not ready yet

1724747 growing up in nigeria my brother nidal and i developed a special connection to the land
1724748 since we were flying people in from around the world i thought it would be a great idea to plant trees for each of the over 200 guests attending my brothers wedding
1724749 nidal was worried about all the waste we were creating and we started to question what we were doing because weve always been concerned about aiding the environment rather than destroying it
1724750 we wanted to start a trend and usually trends in lebanon start with drinking and dancing but we thought with the trees we could make the idea interesting enough that it would inspire others
1724751 the brochures and small wooden tree silhouette souvenirs donated by ibsar aided us in raising the consciousness of our guests
1724752 october and november are the most dangerous months here for fires because the land is neglected and with drought the bio mass becomes a dangerous fire fuse

1724754 the diverse species of native trees and shrubs many of which are relics and currently either threatened or endangered should be preserved before they disappear forever

1724763 the thinking now is that we could potentially split the project into two bid packages one for the work to be done when the lake is up and one when the lake is down

1724765 in the construction world a lot of people are seeking jobs
1724766 we ended up with one bidder which influenced the maximum prices
1724767 in the end the city felt that we could find a general contractor and subcontractors who could provide competitive pricing more in line with industry standards

1724808 tea consumption has been associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in several studies green tea is consumed less in the western world than black tea but it could be more beneficial because of the way it seems to improve endothelial function in this same context recent studies have also shown potent anticarcinogenic effects of green tea attributed to its antioxidant properties
1724809 tea leaves destined to be sold as white tea undergo even less processing than green tea leaves instead of air drying the unwithered leaves are merely steamed

1724814 i mmigration undermines many of the objectives that our modern middle class society sets for itself and exacerbates many of the problems brought on by modernization
1724815 in short mass immigration is incompatible with a modern society as hudson institute scholar john fonte has
1724816 most of the time the reasons for discord are not even as salient as race they can be ethnicity from time to time americans have fought each other for these reasons but race is the deepest most constant source of antipathy unlike language or religion race cannot change differences between men that are written deep into their bodies will always be a source of friction
1724817 even among the third generation the native born grandchildren of long ago mexican immigrants welfare use is triple the rate for other natives and nearly half live in or near poverty
1724818 mass immigration overwhelms our administrative capacity to screen out enemies or locate and remove them if theyre already here a particularly outrageous example of this conflict in 2003 immigration and naturalization service contract workers at a service center in southern california were charged with coping with the ongoing tsunami of paperwork by shredding immigration documents in order to wipe out a ninety thousand document backlog there after two months of shredding the backlog was wiped out but they kept shredding as new mail came in to ensure that the backlog didnt return
1724819 an effective strategy of immigration law enforcement requires no land mines no tanks no tattooed arms none of the cartoonish images invoked in the objections raised routinely by supporters of loose borders the consistent application of ordinary law enforcement tools is all thats needed
1724820 p olitical support for a new commitment to enforcement might well be undermined if an exodus of biblical proportions were to be televised in every american living room
1724821 this means eliminating altogether todays immigration categories for the adult siblings of citizens the adult children of citizens the parents of adult citizens and the adult children of legal residents these are grown people with their own lives for whom family reunification is a misnomer
1724822 already shares information from tax returns with the department of education on student loan defaulters and the social security administration and the centers for medicare and medicaid services to confirm eligibility for benefits
1724823 people admitted on student visas should be limited to no more than one percent of total national enrollment which would translate generously to 150 000
1724824 no more than a small share say 5 percent of any particular schools total enrollment should consist of foreign students
1724825 the american taxpayer both state and federal is supporting extremely expensive research universities whose main educational purpose is to train students from abroad when these students finish their educations they either stay here taking relatively high paying jobs that could have gone to americans or they go home taking our knowledge and technology with them congress and the public dont seem yet to have noticed that while largely ignoring our own students we are putting our money and our best talent into training our economic competitors just wait until this one hits the fan

1724854 with us trying to operate that theatre as a discount theatre and the fact that we have had some competition open up around us that has made it difficult to maintain attendance and keep it a profitable business
1724855 but we needed to operate this theatre with the dignity and respect that the people of clemson have come to know and to operate it any differently would have been a disservice
1724856 well always offer the manager of the theatre an opportunity to relocate
1724857 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1724858 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular for us people are people you should all have your own opinion we are hopefully putting the human element in what is an unfortunate part of life there are people over there dealing with situations like this and were showing the human part of being there
1724859 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness

1724868 do you think you have a larger responsibility then other clubs
1724869 our function is not to have fun but social justice and integration of cultures the survey only tells about the student population

1724872 with the parents of his victims watching a few feet away a mexican born condemned killer apologized before he was executed for his part in a horrific attack on two teenage girls 15 years ago
1724873 its not who you are on the inside but what you do that defines you
1724874 for some reason there were people who just did not like me i did not know why any slight disrespect seen or unseen t kinter 2 oward a person of power within the church will not go unnoticed the only reason i could see why these accusations were made towards me would be because i slightly disagreed with one of the church members on his method of inducting what we called gentiles people unaffiliated with the church
1724875 when speaking to people outside of the congregation the language barrier was not that big but its always the small things im used to it now but curse words when speaking to people were quite shocking to me at first especially when i was on my mission i was amazed at how much people cursed without seeming to even blink an eye still to this day that is one thing that sticks with me is not cursing for some reason i dont do it or enjoy hearing it
1724876 we do use a lot of terms form the book of mormon even in every day life
1724877 since ive been here my language has changed drastically i kind of got a feel for it on my mission but being fully immersed in it forces you to function properly people would always think i was talking down to them though it wasnt said i could tell by their change in attitude and when speaking religion to someone who is not familiar with mormonism is almost like speaking another language
1724878 well when i was on my mission or even at home we dressed like that regularly i just couldnt see myself wearing any other clothes but people automatically assume two things when they see me one im a mormon on a mission who is going to give them a magazine that they are going to throw away or two people think im a professor at work i think the tie and slacks is very positive because when they see me they automatically assume i know what im talking about
1724879 it was pretty ordinary nobody ever had interesting hobbies and certain books were prohibited in our town but now i know a lot of books were prohibited it seems really boring stale and controlling on the outside looking in and people always ask me what we did for fun but i was happy and so was my family and thats what kinter 6 mattered i mean everyone sacrifices certain freedoms for their families i guess we just sacrifice a little more then others
1724880 every thing was about the church and what we could do to better the church everything every little action is motivated by that even the actions to some that would seem self motivated are not in fundamentalists mormonism i getting married was a move chosen by the church and polygamy practiced by us is most definitely a collective behavior it is to further the churches brethren
1724881 it was always a rest phase when one of the wives of the saints were not pregnant they were constantly pregnant or taking care of children i thought i had no room as an individual but looking back on it women had even less room to be themselves if not none it was always for the church their bodies literally belonged to the church
1724882 in mormonism there is a prophet this person is not kinter 7 chosen by the church members or saints but is born into the position ones position as a prophet is that they are literally the voice of god god bids the prophet what to do so in a sense he is all seeing and knowing there is no questioning the prophet that is absolute but when accused for something you didnt do then that faith is surely shaken this isnt the first time and surely not the last a church member has been wrongfully accused and excommunicated so of course when going to met warren jeffs our prophet kinter 4 i thought if he was the voice of god then he would know i had done nothing wrong this was not the case
1724883 gaming for me is almost like living a life outside of this world and i find that very interesting

1725136 great opportunity for shareholders frustrated with lonmins significant operational challenges
1725137 onexim to complete consolidation of 16 stake in mmc norilsk nickel to be sold to vladimir potanin
1725138 all that the company wanted to announce it did in the press release that is all we wish to say
1725139 it is now clear that this announcement stems from an earlier offer that interros had made to onexim to buy its shares in norilsk for 32 share at a time when onexim was in the process of selling a 25 block to uc rusal for around 25 share it would seem that onexim still believes this offer is still open although onexim clearly does not have 16 of norilsk to sell
1725140 its a nice business bought at about 270 share and sold at 315
1725141 as rusal doesnt have enough money now and the ipo has been suspended by the london court proceedings against deripaska they may consider that becoming a norilsk portfolio investor is the best choice
1725142 we do not understand why potanin would want to buy norilsk nickel shares at a 45 premium to the market or how prokhorov obtained norilsks shares to sell given that he sold the majority of his interest in norilsk to rusal in may 2008

1725248 for all of the variety noel gallagher is capable of hes still not above using the old tried and true devices to get his point across liams torn apart vocals provide the blood and guts necessary to make the songs heartfelt
1725249 a step up from their last 2 albums suggesting they can crib from u2 and t rex while maintaining whats theirs
1725250 the new cd crackles with anger energy and defiance they can still bring it on
1725251 crying your heart out and she is love are probably the most efficient infectious pop noels ever written
1725252 play it loud and you can still believe this is the band who hosted the biggest rocknroll block party since punk
1725253 sonically giants is easily their boldest work with mastermind noel gallagher and new co producer mark spike stent layering backward guitars and turntable scratching over huge trash can beats that actually swing a bit
1725254 less clotted and grating than 1997s be here now the sonic openness allows gallaghers melodies and guitar and his brother liams pissy bray to shine brighter
1725255 an effective modern psychedelic record that has dumped the bombast of yore and replaced it with some real emotion oasis are still british rocknrolls brightest hope
1725256 a good lp containing a few new tricks the huge beat meets led zeppelin riffs instrumental first track and the groovy go let it out get the album off to a great start
1725257 its most heartfelt record to date unabashedly couching their influences in an anthemic often psychedlic pop framework still a force to be reckoned with
1725258 a good record confirms oasis as the rolling stones of their generation rather than the beatles good enough to make you remember their past greatness
1725259 the more you hear the album the more its melodies gnaw into the brain and the subtle complexities of its arrangements unfold a much better album than be here now
1725260 it is a transitional work the album oasis had to make to prove to themselves as much as anyone else that the desire still lay within
1725261 so you want to be a rock amp roll star
1725262 heavier on guitar than suede or blur theyre the heavier outfit and with youths blithe arrogance they see the world solely in black and white
1725263 their collective gift superheated brazen guitar married to wonderfully daft and striking lyrics delivered with guttersnipe self possession a rutting mess of glam punk and psychedelia
1725264 yet another young thrusting white guitar band a perfect hybrid of the stone roses sun kissed pop sense and happy mondays thuggish laddishness
1725265 oasis might last as long as the smiths or shine as brightly and briefly as suede
1725266 full of fire oasis didnt just seize the day they shagged it senseless and then took it out boozing
1725267 oasis have encapsulated the most triumphant feeling yeah that good
1725268 60s and 70s rock classicism writ large and loud all broad strokes and bullish enthusiasm noel gallagher fires up sing along hooks with industrial strength glam rock licks
1725269 theyre still angling for the set in stones title of the worlds greatest rock amp roll band a truly massive attack a thick as guinness crunch of guitars and drums all cranked to 11 each track is crammed with keyboards sound effects and layer upon layer of noels twisting shimmering guitar overdubs
1725270 at their best oasis is untouchable here they occasionally reach a best which is better than any best you might have previously imagined possible
1725271 mammoth probably but without the large hairy bollocks each song already resonates with the vast communal spirit that has propelled them thus far here are yet another 11 songs the slightly sozzled world will be bursting to sing

1725275 top 500 and earned a stevie r award as the
1725276 a big loud strangely unaffecting record its mostly fun going right back to the broad singalong gallagher karaoke of more innocent times
1725277 their greatest hits played out under the twin towers drenched in a beery atmosphere swaying sing alongs and big screen bravado the definitive oasis collection played with an edgy passion which should shame every rock giant past and present
1725278 a surprise feel good experience and a rather touching tribute to a great bands resilience in the face of its own self destructive tendencies
1725279 the fearsome sound of the nations most brilliantly belligerent rocknrollers in their element they sound like the least jaded band on the planet
1725280 oasis borrow shamelessly from artists like the rolling stones t rex the kinks small faces and especially the beatles without losing their own snide identity
1725281 while their debut was an up tempo pop roar this one showed that they were just as talented with rock ballads
1725282 an earnest relaxed undertaking that is less about making a splash and more about making a point
1725283 a wonderful often beautiful album which single handedly spoke for a generation of slobbishly dressed inarticulate men it was a complete album
1725284 the first truly convincing rocknroll album of the 90s you liked the first album then youll love this one this is the business the real thing its bloody great
1725285 as exciting and chock full of insta classics as their wake up call of a debut clever production tricks and chord changes are noel gallaghers passions his lyrics flit between inane and ingenious but every last one fits snug as a puzzle
1725286 the heady bravura of the britpop era still resonates in the album that elevated oasis to superstar status
1725287 their second lp sends them off in an altogether different direction away from the conscience free overloaded hedonism towards an understanding of its consequences

1725365 t his interview will open many peoples eyes it will shake islam from the roots and im not exaggerating
1725366 what other case do you know where a son of a hamas leader who was raised on the tenets of extremist islam comes out against it
1725367 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
1725368 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers
1725369 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading
1725370 the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
1725371 i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
1725372 i felt responsible it was better for me to be there rather than a gang of fools who would poison his mind
1725373 i tried to understand those people their thoughts in order to change them from inside by means of a strong person like my father who admitted to me in the past that he does not support suicide attacks
1725374 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do
1725375 then in prison i understood that not everyone in hamas is like my father hes a nice friendly man but i discovered how evil his colleagues are
1725376 after my release i lost the faith i had in those who ostensibly represented islam
1725377 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas
1725378 islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
1725379 in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr
1725380 they hamas are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise
1725381 take them out of the darkness and the prison of islam
1725382 in that way theyll have an opportunity to correct their mistakes to become better people and to bring a chance for peace in the middle east
1725383 but at the moment at least my ambitions are only to find work a place to live
1725384 i was about to become one of those homeless people in the united states
1725385 but people from the church are helping me im dependent on them
1725386 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity
1725387 maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah with jesus in the kingdom of god
1725388 now you can tell me what kind of friend he is

1725416 the next step for us will be further investigation into hydrogen production as well as constructing more mathematical models capable of integrating various sources of biological data
1725417 the findings in this study may be considered encouraging in many ways the average amount of alcohol has decreased in more recently born cohorts the percentage of the population exhibiting moderate alcohol intake has been increasing steadily and the percentage reporting heavy drinking has decreased over time while these data suggest the development of more favorable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century that also show that at the same time the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted

1725473 an influence is not the same as a cause genes and hormones may predispose a person to one sexuality rather than another but thats all predisposition and determination are two different things there is a major problem with gay gene theory and with all theories that posit the biological programming of sexual orientation if heterosexuality and homosexuality are indeed genetically predetermined and therefore mutually exclusive and unchangeable how do we explain bisexuality or people who suddenly in mid life switch from heterosexuality to homosexuality or vice versa we cant the reality is that queer and straight desires are far more ambiguous blurred and overlapping than any theory of genetic causality can allow
1725474 the relative influence of biological versus social factors with regard to sexual orientation is still uncertain what is however certain is that if gayness was primarily explainable in genetic terms we would expect it to appear in the same proportions and in similar forms in all cultures and all epochs as the anthropologists clellan ford and frank beach demonstrated in patterns of sexual behaviour 1965 far from being cross culturally uniform and stable both the incidence and expressions of same sex desire vary vastly between different societies
1725475 the homophobes are thus paradoxically closer to the truth than many gay activists
1725476 for most of us it is impossible to subsequently change our sexual orientation
1725477 to be haitian or a hemophiliac is determined at birth but being gay is an identity that is socially determined and involves personal choice even if as many want to argue one has no choice in experiencing homosexual desire there is a wide choice of possible ways of acting out these feelings from celibacy and denial to self affirmation and the adoption of a gay identity
1725478 i think the idea that sexuality is genetic is crap there is absolutely no evidence for it at the moment and i think it is unhealthy that people want to embrace this idea it does reflect a desire to say its not our fault as a way of deflecting our critics we have achieved what we have achieved by defiance not by concessions i think we should be recruiting people to homosexuality its a great lifestyle and something everybody should have the right to experience if you believe its genetic how are you going to make the effort
1725479 on the question of recruiting to homosexuality well of course i am in favor of this i believe homosexuality to be a perfectly valid lifestyle choice i am naturally keen to encourage people to participate in the gay lifestyle

1725486 like you im a firm believer in spanking however often when i give my 4yo son the paddle he will wet on me during the punishment would you give extra spanks for this and how can i stop it
1725487 the boys seem to need whacking more often as theyre generally more boisterous but when the girls need a smacked bum its often for rather more serious misbehaviour girls tend to be rather more sly and unkind when theyre naughty
1725488 my oldest is 7 linda and i are very pro spanking as are all our family i just wanted to say congratulations on your new site
1725489 i totally agree with your sooner rather than later advice and that the right time to start is around 18 months
1725490 i also agree that toddlers most certainly need to feel it sharply and that the diaper should be removed and that about six or seven firm spanks should administered on the bare bottom and yes indeed his or her bottom should be red
1725491 speaking of which as far as my two boys are concerned this summer certainly seems to be turning into the summer of the red
1725492 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur

1725507 no intelligent jury in the world could fail to bring in a verdict that the resurrection account was true
1725508 this was the conclusion to which a former lord chief justice of england lord darling came at a private dinner party the talk turned to the truth of christianity and particularly to a certain book dealing with the resurrection placing his fingertips together assuming a judicial attitude and speaking with a quiet emphasis that was extraordinarily impressive he said we as christians are asked to take a very great deal on trust the teachings for example and the miracles of jesus if we had to take all on trust i for one should be sceptical the crux of the problem of whether jesus was or was not what he proclaimed himself to be must surely depend upon the truth or otherwise of the resurrection on that greatest point we are not merely asked to have faith in its favour as a living truth there exists such overwhelming evidence positive and negative factual and circumstantial that no intelligent jury in the world could fail to bring in a verdict that the resurrection story is true

1725735 there were several people at the residence at the time of the shooting but she wasnt pronounced dead until she got to the hospital we are still getting statements and talking to people and trying to figure out what happened
1725736 first i think everybody in bluefield recognizes that city park is a very important asset to the city and the citizens of bluefield and bluefield va
1725737 the tennis courts were just really in a condition that was unplayable and tennis is a sport enjoyed by both young and old we decided on a proactive basis to take this on as a project and mitchell stadium is an excellent stadium june shott made possible the astroturf for the artificial field that is there so really the only thing left to finish that up and to make this a top notch stadium was to get these dressing rooms up to standard we will now have as good of a stadium as there is in west virginia when this is over we already have a lot of activity at that stadium and maybe we can attract some more activity
1725738 they will meet the standards for meeting class aaa playoff games

1725746 it goes back to the enlightenment about 400 years or so
1725747 and when you go back to those original ideas you see a number of things emerging among them the notion that science and tech can be applied to human affairs and things can be engineered and improved upon
1725748 i think we have a 50 percent chance of getting there in around 25 years so long as the early proof of concept work in mice is well enough funded for the next 10 years or so

1725751 brereton farewell as one that least i knew great was thy love with divers as i hear but common voice doth not so sore thee rue as other twain that doth before appear but yet no doubt but they friends thee lament and other hear their piteous cry and moan so doth each heart for thee likewise relent that thou givest cause thus to be dead and gone
1725752 the cause whereof i die judge not but if you judge judge best
1725753 this show takes a lot of artistic license i dont know of any historical evidence to back up the idea that brereton confessed to ensure annes execution thereby martyring himself the show also implies that he was poisoning anne did you notice that before each miscarriage he is shown serving her and her obvious suspicion history kind of suggests that he was set up so that cromwell could aquire his lands and holdings

1725763 if it hindered the use of that vehicle for the purpose for which it was intended
1725764 in the circumstances the driver of the fire vehicle was fully entitled to exceed the speed limit
1725765 and that speed before the point of impact was not excessive
1725766 it must be remembered that mr mcintosh did nothing wrong
1725767 he had been licensed to drive for 12 years his traffic lights were at green
1725768 much has been made of mr mcintoshs deafness but he was a road user

1725856 hamdan is now considered a convicted war criminal and is no longer considered an enemy combatant and will be held separately from the other detainees at guantanamo because of his new status
1725857 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1725858 the verdict i think was in in this case long before the jury went out to deliberate
1725859 that is that the military commission system at guantanamo bay is deeply flawed that mr hamdan could not and did not receive a fair trial
1725860 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
1725861 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less

1725868 we are continuing to move along at a very deliberate and aggressive pace here because our desire remains to complete the source selection process by the end of this year
1725869 you build a case not only based on the science but also on the activity of the subject
1725870 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guantanamo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice
1725871 the travesty of this verdict now is that had the case gone to trial in 2004 he would have been acquitted of all the charges

1725880 outstanding loans sanctioned in a particular state region and utilized in that place
1725881 there are winners and losers there are some regions that have gained more than others
1725882 comparing the data for end march 1991 with the recently released numbers for end march 2007 the northern and western regions have been the biggest gainers in terms of credit growth
1725883 its delhi that gained the most with its share of credit going up from 7 1 in 1991 to 12 in 2007 the shares of haryana punjab himachal pradesh and jammu and kashmir all declined over the period while that of rajasthan was flat
1725884 in the south the big beneficiary has been karnataka its share went up from 6 4 to 8 8 keralas share went down from 3 7 to 3 1 andhra pradeshs from 7 2 to 6 6 and tamil nadus from 10 6 to 9 9
1725885 the data also corresponds to the increasing metropolitan focus of credit delivery the numbers show that 66 1 of credit was utilized in the metropolitan centres in 2007 compared with 46 in 1991 naturally this will mean more credit growth in places such as delhi and mumbai thats probably the result both of the decay of rural india as well as the more rapid growth of these centres
1725886 from 10 2 in december 1981 to 7 2 in march 1991 growth in that period was more uniform with all the southern states except kerala gaining modestly during the decade as did mp up orissa and assam
1725887 these will create immense political strains between indian states and the potential for serious differences
1725888 they have exemplified the saying to him that hath more shall be given and from him that hath not the little that he hath shall be taken away the rich have become richer and the poor have become poorer and the vessel of the state is driven between the scylla and charybdis of anarchy and despotism such are the effects which must ever flow from an unmitigated exercise of the calculating faculty
1725889 we want to provide those who have been and continue to be affected by the negative impacts of the prison system with a sense of hope and to let them know that they are not forgotten no matter what adversities one may face in life one thing remains true and that is that somebody loves you

1725900 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1725901 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1725956 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1725957 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1725958 the question posed is clear and calls for a simple answer does iran accept the freeze for freeze offer to launch negotiations it does not require further clarification
1725959 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations

1725971 sms costs are in the aggregate 4x higher than getting data from the hubble space telescope global sms revenues are larger than the hollywood movie music and video game industries combined
1725972 i could personally store and forward all of canadas sms traffic myself via my novus broadband in yaletown and it would have limited impact on my bittorrenting

1725985 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1725986 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1725987 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal

1725996 all we can do is express disappointment that terminal 5 has not been the answer to all of bas prayers we are seeing some improvements but not that significant in terms of where ba is featuring in european airline league tables
1725997 these aea figures reflect past problems at heathrow which have been well documented our advertising campaign represents the current reality at terminal 5 which offers customers the best heathrow experience they have had for many years it is not surprising if other airlines are jealous
1725998 heathrow airport is completely full there are no spare landing slots which means the slightest disruption will cause problems in terms of punctuality this underlines the need for a third runway until we get runway expansion there will be problems

1726042 and they now understand that it wasnt in the best judgement

1726044 when you train your whole life for something dot all your is and cross all your ts why wouldnt you be better safe than sorry they have pollution in los angeles and if the olympics were in los angeles we would probably wear these masks too

1726132 usually such a beautiful vehicle would have passed undetected as they are difficult to steal
1726133 it became obvious that he had stolen the 4x4 his youth and being alone in the vehicle gave him away
1726134 if their eyes were not as sharp they would have let the man pass simply because he was driving a fancy vehicle

1726161 but while the economic outlook is uncertain investors realise that the other factors that make clean tech an attractive proposition such as rising energy process and underlying regulatory issues are still there
1726162 what were seeing is that the first wave of wind and solar firms in particular are starting to mature

1726179 once i stopped taking my failure to communicate personally and stopped trying the same old methods that didnt work i slowly began to get better and better results let the audience decide the meaning pay attention to the response and try something different if it isnt the response you want it is as simple as that

1726218 in serving the mandate of the rensselaer plan to transform the institute into a pre eminent technological research university with global reach and global impact the formal agreement with zhejiang university certainly hits the mark
1726219 zheda is a pre eminent university in china with outstanding faculties of science engineering and management the fit with rensselaer is very good in terms of research interests
1726220 we are very enthusiastic about our collaboration with the lally school of rensselaer our two institutions have very complementary strengths relating to global entrepreneurship and technology commercialization we have had very constructive discussions and plan on launching specific collaborative activities this academic year
1726221 zheda has almost 2 000 international students who follow studies in english and mandarin and is well situated to accommodate the rising demand for student exchanges from all academic units within rensselaer
1726222 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
1726223 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
1726224 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
1726225 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
1726226 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1726227 i think if they really build one of these quantum computers there will definitely be resonators in them
1726228 the insertion of the talent has made the show fresh again

1726230 we have increased our forecast because there has already been a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic have developed
1726231 the primary concern with our current very active seasonal forecast numbers is the continued ocean surface warming in the eastern and central tropical pacific although it seems unlikely at this point there is a possibility that a weak el nino could develop by the latter part of the hurricane season if this happened it would likely reduce the number of late season tropical cyclones
1726232 we expect the atlantic basin tropical cyclone season will be very active with activity that is about 190 percent of the long term average
1726233 we base our predictions on long period statistical models constructed on the past 60 years of historical data residents should take these forecasts as an indication of what this years hurricane activity is likely to be if the global atmosphere and ocean behave in the next few months as they have over the last 60 years no seasonal forecasts can determine when or where storms are going to strike so coastal residents should take precautions during hurricane season and be prepared
1726234 the same factors that make individual months active or inactive are often not the same factors that make the entire season active or inactive
1726235 we are continually improving our forecasts to provide people with specific monthly hurricane forecasts along with landfall probability forecasts
1726236 we are in an active cycle in the atlantic basin that is expected to last another 15 to 20 years we believe this is part of a natural ocean cycle and is not the result of human induced increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide

1726244 you are not allowed to interview anyone here without a public affairs officer present
1726245 just the usual stuff theyre sending a whole bunch of troops over to afghanistan right now
1726246 word around washington is that theyre also sending a lot of military civil affairs personnel there to help get afghan schools hospitals sewage etc up and working to find out what the locals want and then try and get it for them
1726247 so what you are telling me here is that a lot of the us military operations in iraq are now moving to afghanistan
1726248 well i could tell you more but frankly this is embarrassing youre the one whos in the middle east right now not me
1726249 the us military isnt the only group that is moving to afghanistan
1726250 so what you are telling me is that what doesnt go on in iraq stays in afghanistan
1726251 pretty much as things calm down in iraq they seem to be heating up in afghanistan proportionately
1726252 yes apparently theres a young asian filmmaker over in kuwait right now and she sounds like an interesting person to interview shes been filming in iraq since before shock and awe and has witnessed the whole thing from the days of saddam until now see if you can get a hold of her i hear that shes got some amazing stories to tell
1726253 she says that six years ago all the iraqis constantly told her how much they just loved saddam hussein and now using the exact same tone of voice and with the exact same glazed over look in their eyes iraqis are now telling her how much they just love the americans

1726270 house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said she unlike other catholic politicians who support abortion rights has not clashed with her church about receiving communion
1726271 i think so i was raised in a very strict upbringing in a catholic home where we respected people were observant were practicing catholics and that the fundamental belief was that god gave us all a free will and we were accountable for that each of us each person had that accountability so it wasnt for us to make judgments about how people saw their responsibility and that it wasnt for politicians to make decisions about how people led their personal lives certainly to a high moral standards but when it got into decisions about privacy and all the rest then that was something that individuals had to answer to god for and not to politicians
1726272 to me it isnt even a question god has given us a free will were all responsible for our actions if you dont want an abortion you dont believe in it then dont have one but dont tell somebody else what they can do in terms of honoring their responsibilities my family is very pro life theyre not fanatics and theyre not activists i think theyd like it if i were not so vocally pro choice

1726397 boris johnson has removed from the room the very people whose constituents are most in need of the ldas regeneration work it shows the lack of seriousness that boris johnson really places on the issue of regenerating londons poorest areas so that all londoners can participate in our citys success

1726416 the general take on barack obama is that hes an exciting candidate bright energetic charismatic filled with good ideas and on occasion not afraid to express them but not quite mature enough as a national politician with not much of an experiential record to run on hes certainly a positive fresh new face and will be a force to be reckoned with in 2112 and beyond but probably not this time out unless as the vice presidential nominee on someone elses ticket
1726417 knows what hes doing first he has to get into the white house then he can move on his more enlightened agenda
1726418 look this guy obama is going to eat you for lunch theres no way youre going to beat him by taking the high road and arguing ideas and policies the public wants him and his ideas not you and yours the only way you can beat him is if they dont want him anymore if theyre disenchanted if enough questions are raised about him to make them think twice were going to spend many millions to rebrand mr obama our aim is to draw these undecided voters into the mccain voting column of course but even if they dont come on over well be satisfied if they dont vote or work for obama
1726419 the point is that youre not trying necessarily to get voters to accept everything you say about obama as the truth that would be lovely of course but well be happy if enough of them start to wonder about him have doubts about him and oh boy hes stepping right into our trap by appearing as a flip flopper all his own and in his joke about not looking like other presidents on dollar bills which alludes to the fact that hes african american it was like christmas for us in july and we werent going to send that gift back but run with it all the way to november

1726515 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guant namo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice the judgment against hamdan undoubtedly will be challenged in legitimate courts but there is no appeal from the judgment of future generations this system was devised to permit the prosecution of alleged wrongdoing by detainees while continuing to cover up the wrongdoing by government interrogators trials that are shrouded in secrecy and tainted by coercion are the very antithesis of american justice
1726516 we might well start 2008 09 with largely the squad we had last season and after all they didnt do too badly

1726524 i think nationally and here people are kind of tired of the way the bush administration has been conducting the policies of this country
1726525 lets save this for when i see you if we argue about it now well both decide not to get together
1726526 i watched obama when he was here and i think we need someone like him to advocate for us i have no doubts that hes pro israel mccain is too although like obama hes not a leader on israel issues i suspect that they would be pretty much the same as president
1726527 my friends and i prefer obama because when he defends us people will listen bush is pro israel but when he defends us all it does is emphasize how alone we are all we have is bush who is hated worldwide and commands no respect so who cares if he defends us everytime he opens his mouth we lose support
1726528 but when obama goes before the un or the europeans or the africans and asians and says look israel has legitimate grievances too they will pay attention
1726529 mccain cant do anything for us except make us look like a pariah defended by an old conservative president who is identified on the wrong side of every issue
1726530 of course i read his speeches i heard him talk off the cuff he knows israel deeply all mccain does is say there will never be another holocaust like hes some 70 year old jewish leader from america obama speaks a language the world understands and speaks it well mccain does tired talking points being defended by mccain will be a minus not a plus
1726531 no i think its half and half the young ones for sure the guys in the army they agree i mean who could be excited by mccain especially here where he means nothing but the continuation of bush look where that got us
1726532 what we need is someone who can come up with some new ideas about neutralizing iran we need somebody smart we dont need the same old ideas that dont work anyway i dont know for sure that things will be better with obama but i know they wont be better with mccain so the choice is obvious
1726533 if your president makes america more credible it makes your allies more credible too a president who is bad for america is even worse for us
1726534 the things hoover believed in efficiency enterprise opportunity individualism substantial laissez faire personal success material welfare were all in the dominant american tradition the ideas he represented ideas that to so many people made him seem hateful or ridiculous after 1929 were precisely the same ideas that in the remotest past of the nineteenth century and the more immediate past of the new era had had an almost irresistible lure for the majority of americans

1726555 this war will never be forgotten nor will the heroes who fight in it
1726556 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1726557 i think the market realizes this kind of pressure from congress may in fact lead to a change in policy
1726558 you say i must eat so many lemons because i am so bittah
1726559 i can feel that im a better match official then when i left
1726560 it was such a great experience i was able to learn so many things it was a different ball game all together to officiate at that level was a different story im really happy with my form and i think i performed to what the irb expected of me
1726561 i was able to mingle with top referees in the world especially south african referees mark lawrence and craig joubert i learnt a lot from them
1726562 i was a bit nervous at first especially coming into the changing room and seeing these star players the crowd was so vocal during the national anthems and after kick off but i was able to do my normal thing
1726563 its a good opportunity to officiate at a different level and i think the irb is trying to keep me exposed to a high level of competition
1726564 i think the irb is happy with my performance which is why im getting these appointments
1726565 we have had high hopes for him ever since he started and he has done just that he deserves it because he has worked hard for it his continued progress to the top has opened up opportunities for the association
1726566 because of his success the irb referees association has taken more interest in us and we are enjoying more irb certified referees and coaching clinics things that we found hard to come by in the past
1726567 i think ive motivated a lot of young people to take up refereeing but nothing comes easy and they will need to work hard
1726568 where as it used to be sort of keystone of advertising you know the ability to tell a story it now is is one of many many ways to communicate with people
1726569 becuase if you rely just on narrative as i said before then youre up against hollywood
1726570 it starts not from a tag line or a punchline but from understanding where the consumer is what theyre doing and what they want
1726571 facebook is the 21st century malt shop its where people go to hang out and the last thing they want is some salesperson trying to have a conversation with them while theyre figuring out what movie theyre going to see they dont want to talk to you they want to talk to their friends
1726572 is about consumer empowerment the ability to research and learn about products and services and make decisions independent of marketing and advertising
1726573 to give you an example i want to buy an ipod adapter for my car

1726576 tout a cest une manipulation on tente de criminaliser les associations pour quon se d sint resse de ce qui se passe dans les centres de r tention
1726577 avec de telles manoeuvres dintimidation le ministre de limmigration sen prend au travail de toutes les associations de soutien aux sans papiers il tente devant lopinion publique de trouver un bouc missaire et porte ainsi atteinte la libert dexpression et de manifestation

1726589 if i came into that property and half a million dollars i would raze that house to the ground theres always been something weird about it since we moved in there when i was 13 i could never fall asleep without having a mild panic attack first so many mornings id wake up with all my clothes still on and the tv blaring because i hadnt wanted to go to sleep my room was always freezing cold and its still the same and every time i come visit and have all these plans to do stuff and clean up i always just end up at the kitchen table playing solitaire theres like a giant force of inertia here that sucks you into it

1726593 people want to know how people make decisions whether its how you drive your car or whether to invest in a mortgage its important to understand when and how we make those decisions to understand the type of errors people are prone to make
1726594 what we have found is that people make decisions based on what option appears to be better most of the time under conditions in the natural world this would be the best strategy but in modern life it has nothing do with the real inherent risks
1726595 you save one minute but you can lose everything people dont do the math
1726596 weve evolved to be afraid of snakes but not traffic lights

1726616 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions

1726618 this is just another interim step toward the final goal
1726619 the town may not quite have everything but with both low crime and low property taxes you wont hear many complaints

1726622 but over the years the species had not been spotted in these areas for such a long time we had read in the books that the species was found in these areas but since its study has not been done after its naming in 1881 it is data deficient
1726623 as for now i cannot say much about the species i will take these samples to delhi show it to my teachers and most probably study its anatomy to know more about the species sinceit is found in makaibari it cannot be called as extinct but it is endemic meaning that it is only found in this region and not anywhere in the world
1726624 since makaibari is an organic tea garden and there is no use of pesticides and insecticides the species might be finding safe to stay here this however proves that the environment here is clean and green for animals like this the population of this species however seems to be a lot in this estate so far
1726625 till today no study has been done so far and that must be the reason why there is no enough data on the species
1726626 so far we were not aware of this creature we have come to about it after robin and one of his teacher who came here and told us about it we then searched in the garden area along with robin finally we got this in a garden area after which robin wa able to find seven species in the area
1726627 the creature always seemed to me a unique one since i knew nothng about the creature i had never spoken about it to anyone neither did i take any interest in it

1726690 the market for new homes in houston faces considerable cross currents with strong job growth and a strong economy challenged by mortgage constraints and competition from foreclosures and the resale market
1726691 despite the short term uncertainty the positive aspects of houstons economy and new home market will allow it to recover more quickly than other u s markets beset by affordability issues and weak job growth

1726703 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1726704 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1726705 the discovery of such a large population of western lowland gorillas is absolutely fantastic news for the sub species and for conservationists but we should be careful not to be too complacent
1726706 the area where these gorillas have been found is in the path of the ebola virus which has wiped out large numbers of western lowland gorillas during the past 25 years
1726707 numbers are less important than trends and sadly the trend for all gorilla sub species apart from the mountain gorillas has been a downturn in population figures
1726708 this is clearly at the center of an area we believe has been under served from a geographic standpoint

1726806 ci stiamo preparando bene ha dichiarato il tecnico degli stati uniti e di duke ma per vincere loro non sufficiente nellultima settimana non ci siamo praticamente allenati abbiamo bisogno di mettere a frutto i prossimi tre giorni per poter giocare al livello necessario per competere al meglio nel torneo olimpico pi difficile di sempre abbiamo chiuso la preparazione contro russia e australia due possibili contendenti per le medaglie proprio per metterci subito alla prova in cina siamo stati accolti ovunque con grande entusiasmo e amicizia non vogliamo tradire questa aspettativa qui c molta passione per il basket il debutto del 10 contro i cinesi dar subito il gusto di questa olimpiade

1726832 there was a general feeling that there was a contagion effect
1726833 theres less stress less exposure to violence theyre more likely to finish high school more likely to go to college less likely to be convicted of a crime and all the other predictable outcomes you would expect
1726834 we are the most affordable housing market in the nation for a city of our size
1726835 someone who earns 50 to 60 percent of the median income can pretty much live anywhere in the city if voucher holders are concentrated on the southeast side that means theyre constricted in their ability to choose where to live
1726836 in virtually all american states with the exception of massachusetts the landlord can legally choose not to participate in section 8 no questions asked
1726837 in those situations its not that the poor want to cluster together but that theyre actively sought
1726838 landlords are not doing social policy theyre doing profit maximization
1726839 weve discovered that if given a choice between an apartment and a single family rental house they tend to want to live in the single family unit and theres more of those available southeast and southwest
1726840 people not just poor people but people in general do not necessarily like to move
1726841 think of what it takes to move out of a neighborhood just moving is a huge undertaking and think of all youre leaving behind and now youre entering strange territory
1726842 people are a little leery they say ive lived here all my life
1726843 if i were in charge of the voucher program all landlords would have to participate if they are asked by a tenant and second i would require the local housing authority to help the tenants find locations in low poverty neighborhoods and third i would require voucher holders to find a dwelling in a neighborhood with less than 10 percent poverty
1726844 its a stick to the landlord and a stick to the tenant were not going to let that dynamic happen
1726845 we cannot tell them where to lease at or where not to lease thats steering and steering is illegal
1726846 but we give them areas of opportunity were stretching and making every effort to make sure they have access to all the rental possibilities thats available
1726847 in the briefing we say you can choose wherever you want however did you consider neighborhoods close to the schools your kids go to ones that are close to your job were saying that here jobs bus lines schools and shopping are close by
1726848 are we influencing them yes we are are we steering them no we are not
1726849 but the bottom line is if i make this change will it make my childrens life better all were saying is give it a look
1726850 you can sit in real time and look at rental possibilities and not have to spend gas money driving around
1726851 it has gotten better its not dramatic but every year more and more

1726859 actually i thought it was a compliment in 22 years nobody cared where i played golf now all of a sudden everybody is worried about oh im not going to the british oh man
1726860 and they blasted me for it which is why i was laughing
1726861 i just set a goal and it just taught me i need to set more goals in my life i really havent thought about it my only goal was to make the ryder cup team thats all i focused in on this year next year maybe i need to focus in on winning a major and seeing if i can do that
1726862 put everything i have in there to do it i never really tried to do that
1726863 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1726864 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1726865 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1726866 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand
1726867 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person in my mind
1726868 its not the state dictating these projects its local communities telling us what they need
1726869 were just seeing a huge increase in the number of people desperate for help
1726870 perfect storm of things that are coming together that impact
1726871 people who have never gone to a food bank before are going to food banks
1726872 theyre couch surfing thats a horrible way to raise a family
1726873 people with kids will do just about anything not to let people know they are homeless
1726874 i have heard many people discussing with our volunteers and our staff members how hard it is to pay their rent and how worried they are
1726875 month to month it increases dramatically it looks to me like the economy is getting worse rapidly
1726876 im more concerned with the marginal families who have a job
1726877 we give food boxes to the working poor theyre right on the edge were kind of the last stage
1726878 once you peel the mill away you have a city of 30 000 housing units but 10 000 people
1726879 there is no rural policy for the kind of rural we are
1726880 those historically have relied on natural abundance to support livelihood
1726881 you didnt have to do that much to feel financially secure in those communities today that is no longer the case the challenge is learning new ways to do more with less
1726882 even in nebraska rural and urban senators see things much differently
1726883 you can get the internet here in rural places you can run your home based business
1726884 thats less than half of 1 of whats spent on farm programs annually
1726885 if policy is based on this assumption that rural is really about agriculture then the vast majority of rural america is left out
1726886 we dont want anymore people to have to lose their homes
1726887 in the next 60 days the city of worcester will get some of that money
1726888 it will enable them to do some innovative and helpful things to bring back the neighborhoods that have been affected by these foreclosures
1726889 as an urban center here in new england worcester will see a percentage higher than others
1726890 were trying to make sure were ahead of the curve
1726891 from 1 000 to 2 000 its gone up to 4 000 even if youre working as a couple with two people bringing in money you cant afford it
1726892 you have the bad people going into these empty houses looking for a free place to stay or a nice place to sell drugs
1726893 they get into these houses and they destroy them and then after the city gets them out they close them up and board them up
1726894 yeah im definitely thinking about it because i want to show my fans and people that i can sing live and its really me
1726895 sie haben alles zu unternehmen dass dieses fahrzeug nicht als konkurrenz in unsere produktlinie hinein pfuscht

1726898 check it out eric bana is making love the beast a documentary about his 25 year love affair with a 1974 ford falcon coupe thats right its nothing but eric bana getting sexy with his car and also dr phil is in part of it
1726899 its nice to believe that if you find the field where youre naturally gifted youll be great from day one but it doesnt happen theres no evidence of high level performance without experience or practice reinforcing that no free lunch finding is vast evidence that even the most accomplished people need around ten years of hard work before becoming world class a pattern so well established researchers call it the ten year rule
1726900 it isnt magic and it isnt born it happens because some critical things line up so that a person of good intelligence can put in the sustained focused effort it takes to achieve extraordinary mastery these people dont necessarily have an especially high iq but they almost always have very supportive environments and they almost always have important mentors and the one thing they always have is this incredible investment of effort
1726901 when it comes to choosing a life path you should do what you love because if you dont love it you are unlikely to work hard enough to get very good
1726902 tiger woods is a textbook example of what the research shows because his father introduced him to golf at an extremely early age 18 months and encouraged him to practice intensively woods had racked up at least 15 years of practice by the time he became the youngest ever winner of the u s amateur championship at age 18 also in line with the findings he has never stopped trying to improve devoting many hours a day to conditioning and practice even remaking his swing twice because thats what it took to get even better
1726903 we dont want to shortchange our heritage its that important to the psyche and soul of san antonio
1726904 since ive been mayor nothing has brought me more street compliments
1726905 a good 2 5 to 3 million going into this project that well never see
1726906 but the truth is we would have spent about a third of that had there been no project whatsoever
1726907 you never know exactly what youre going to find when you open up the streets
1726908 i can add and subtract and thats more than the 10 million i agreed to
1726909 so its hard to say whether the january change order was out of bounds
1726910 i think well look back and think our mayor had some real vision i like it its good for our community and its good for visitors
1726911 my kids are hungry i gotta make this work if this doesnt work what will i do

1726967 eine negative u erung in einem internetblog hat binnen sekunden eine flut an erbosten kommentaren zu folge
1726968 die spiele erm glichen den chinesen stolz auf ihr land zu sein
1726969 china war immer sehr bem ht darum allen alles recht zu machen
1726970 viele dachten die olympischen spiele w rden china so ver ndern wie sie das in s dkorea gemacht haben
1726971 china hat sich noch mehr verschlossen und die auflagen versch rft

1727041 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
1727042 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
1727043 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 per cent in 1994 to 38 per cent in 2002
1727044 there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having cost both the woman and the family

1727070 we klagen al jaren over de situatie tot voor kort hadden we de ponton in de veerhaven maar nu die buiten gebruik is gesteld is het behelpen met een paar moeilijk bereikbare aanlegsteigers voor de sluizen moet je je voorstellen dat er iets gebeurt met zon riviercruiseschip en dat honderden mensen van boord moeten
1727071 absurd natuurlijk want waar kun je in de haven gemakkelijker met een ambulance tot aan het water komen dan bij die ponton
1727072 at corresponding engine speeds the vessel was consuming up to 6 less fuel depending on weather conditions after the application of intersleek 900 we originally calculated projected savings based on a bunker price of 450 and found we were saving nearly three tonnes of fuel a day and whilst bunker prices continue to climb our payback period just gets shorter the added advantages of no biocides reduced drydocking times and lower co2 emissions convinced us that this is the technology we need
1727073 we are delighted that in the short time since the prem pride had intersleek 900 applied to her vertical sides the savings are so obvious now the prem divya has had her entire underwater hull coated we look forward to comparing the figures rising bunker prices are generating unprecedented interest in intersleek 900 and we are about to carry out our 120th application

1727075 because of limited comparable data from cms and survey organizations too little is known about the quality of lab testing
1727076 gaos analysis of an indicator that measures a labs ability to consistently produce accurate test results suggests that lab quality may not have improved at hospital labs in recent years
1727077 real and potential lab quality problems are masked by survey complaint and enforcement weaknesses

1727082 establishing the fundamental principles governing the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector
1727083 it is not acceptable to limit mandatory safety investigations to very serious incidents only thus excluding serious accidents
1727084 distress alerts should remain within the scope of the directive so that they are at least examined by the competent body who may subsequently decide whether or not to carry out a full investigation
1727085 your rapporteur considers it essential that member states apply a common methodology in investigating accidents such as foreseen by the commission proposal the councils changes to the text according to which member states would only have to follow principles of the common methodology should thus be rejected
1727086 of utmost importance to ensure that investigative bodies are impartial and functionally independent the directive should make specific references to those national marine authorities from which the investigative bodies must be functionally independent because there could otherwise be a potential conflict of interest
1727087 the maib has been closely engaged in the development of this directive
1727088 we welcome the fact that all eu states will now be required to conduct independent marine safety investigations this will enhance future marine safety

1727221 dean i see you pleaded not guilty so i assume that you didnt do it and are the victim of a terrible miscarriage of justice
1727222 nah i done it all right i was just hoping there might be like a few morons in the jury i could fool
1727223 ah ok well its posive that you accept your guilt is that indicative that you feel some remorse for it
1727224 no way given the chance id do the little fucker again
1727225 i guess he must have done something pretty bad to provoke you to incur such hostility
1727226 damn right he did the fucker looked at me funny had to teach the cunt some respect
1727227 by looked at you funny you must mean that you were afraid he was going to attack you
1727228 not really just didnt like the look of him he looked a bit foreign
1727229 hmm but where you drunk maybe at the time something that would make you more aggressive
1727230 nah i was a bit pissed off cos i hadnt had me any smack for a while but that was it
1727231 ok lets move on and look at the incident itself how many times did you punch the victim
1727232 good good because you didnt want to hurt him unnecessarily presumably
1727233 no cos it only took one punch to floor him i reckon it was cos the dozy twat wasnt watching
1727234 oh right so then he was on the ground and thats when you started kicking him
1727235 was this because you were worried he might get back up and attack you
1727236 nah the cunt was out for the count i was taking the chance to fuck him up while he couldnt touch me
1727237 yes well hmm but you did show admirable restraint in not using your knife obviously you didnt want to ahem fuck him up too badly
1727238 well i didnt want to mess up my knife like bloodstains are you know a fuckin nightmare to clean up course if the bastard had put up a fight like id have sliced him up like bacon
1727239 i see id suggest you dont tell the judge that anyway thats enough information about the offence lets look at what alternatives there might be to going to jail community based sentence are often very effective at addressing offending behaviour as well as making a positive contribution to society are your parents prepared to take you back into a loving family home
1727240 im sorry to hear that but perhaps you could stay with your father he can be a strong positive role model for you
1727241 its true that its sometimes a difficult relationship are there problems because he tries to set you boundaries to give you a proper sense of discipline
1727242 no its cos the fucking bastard beat the crap out of me every time he got drunk since i was seven
1727243 in that case what about your mother im sure she can offer you a caring supportive environment
1727244 my mums too busy as a prossie to care about me
1727245 im sure thats not true and in any case at least she must be earning a steady income through that
1727246 i dont see a fucking penny of it she spends it all on crack
1727247 i see but at least you can stay in the house even if shes not around much
1727248 nah i torched the bloody house like she was pissin me off so i burnt it down
1727249 how unfortunate that a moment of rage should have such devastating results just because the fire brigade couldnt get there in time
1727250 it wasnt un fuckin fortunate mate it was cos i got my mate to call the station and direct the engine to the other side of town
1727251 that showed admirable conncern for the safety of the firefighters not wanting them to risk injury dealing with your fire
1727252 well i dont like them much but i need some muscle to make sure no one else sells drugs in my territory
1727253 you mean you want to keep drug dealers out of the area thats very sensible and completely understandable given whats happened to your mum and your own addiction
1727254 i guess not ok so it looks like we cant fight an alternative place for you to stay other than in jail but thats not too bad you can use the opportunity to get clean of heroin
1727255 no fucking way man cant face that i know theres plenty of drugs in the nick thank fuck plus loads of my mates are there already so ill be fine

1727263 often during drought conditions wild horses or burros may become too weak to search for additional water sources animals will gather around a watering hole or spring that is drying up and be physically unable to travel to water that may be available nearby
1727264 blm is requesting that the public report any suspicious wild horse or burro activities please call the closest blm field office or the blm state office at 801 539 4057

1727266 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1727267 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1727268 the discovery of such a large population of western lowland gorillas is absolutely fantastic news for the sub species and for conservationists but we should be careful not to be too complacent
1727269 the area where these gorillas have been found is in the path of the ebola virus which has wiped out large numbers of western lowland gorillas during the past 25 years
1727270 numbers are less important than trends and sadly the trend for all gorilla sub species apart from the mountain gorillas has been a downturn in population figures

1727288 as for a windfall profits tax if you want to produce more energy it hardly makes sense to give oil companies less incentive to make investments
1727289 nor does it make sense to tax companies because market conditions boost their profits any more than homeowners and shareholders should be penalized for selling during a boom
1727290 obama too has descended to misleading he accuses mccain of wanting to give 4 billion in tax breaks to oil companies without mentioning that this is no special oil only deal just part of mccains proposal for an overall reduction in the corporate tax rate something obama has said hed consider

1727295 gas prices have gone down and theyve gone down in part because the market is realizing that this kind of pressure from the congress may actually cause a change in american policy
1727296 the idea of increasing offshore drilling off the coast of california i think is absurd and i cant even imagine we would entertain that

1727350 the next trial that of khalid sheikh mohammad called the mastermind of the sept 11 attacks will be the real bellwether because it is a case that will raise the issue of harsh interrogations and because it is a death penalty case
1727351 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened

1727357 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1727358 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guantanamo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice
1727359 the travesty of this verdict now is that had the case gone to trial in 2004 he would have been acquitted of all the charges
1727360 the americans have gone back to using the term because it is the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice

1727654 after 4 years in the marine crop i had the gi bill of 60k which im not sure if thats total or what was set aside as well since he did mention having to
1727655 the g i bill enjoys broad support on both sides of the aisle but unfortunately senator cornyn is fighting tooth and nail against giving adequate benefits to our troops and veterans using it as a wedge in partisan politics he needs to lead by example and get his name on a bill our veterans desperately need as an iraq war veteran ill be attending school in the fall under one g i bill or another my future has two paths one is riddled with tuition debt and juggling a full time job with school and the other is a path paved by benefits earned by my service to this country veteran students should not have to make a decision between food and school and if senator cornyn makes the right decision to support this bill we wont have to
1727656 i began using the gi bill less than a year after i returned from iraq unfortunately the amount of money it provided wasnt enough for me to live and go to school at the same time if i hadnt found another source of income i wouldnt have been able to complete my program and to me thats not what the gi bill is supposed to be about after serving in combat veterans shouldnt be placed in a position where they have to choose between going to school and paying the rent that was never the intention of the original bill senator cornyn needs to follow the lead of so many of his colleagues from both sides who are doing the right thing to support our troops and veterans by voting for this bill

1727705 we have a lot of faith in him to get people out
1727706 its working out and ill just keep trying to do whatever i can to help out the club
1727707 we wanted to win that game and somehow we did these guys cleveland have pressed us hard
1727708 these guys have picked me up so many times its a great feeling out there to know these guys have your back especially the bullpen
1727709 the biggest thing is you look around and nobody is counting on you to be that guy
1727710 just coming over here im trying to be comfortable and trying not to do too much i think thats probably helped simplify it obviously some success early helps you relax a little bit
1727711 we scratched and we clawed and we pulled some runs together

1727725 ive got to put it behind myself its going to be difficult sleeping tonight no doubt but when i wake up in the morning its over and thats how im going to approach it
1727726 the whole game i couldnt locate my fastball at all
1727727 its tough to pitch if you cant locate your fastball
1727728 my mechanics have fallen into place over the last three or four games and im able to throw all of my pitches over for strikes now and stay away from the big inning
1727729 throwing first pitch strikes i had some easy innings and it allowed me to stay out there
1727730 they havent seen me and i havent seen them so they really had no idea how i was going to attack them
1727731 theyre a really good fastball hitting team and sometimes thats what you got to do to win
1727732 im more concentrating on the task at hand and thats getting wins for the team
1727733 you cant gauge whether your bullpens going to work out for you based on that tonight we came back and won im just happy we were able to scratch it out

1727738 i hope the next time out im able to do that and do even better
1727739 its good to get the first one out of the way
1727740 i felt a bit nervous being away from the mound and the team for such a long time
1727741 but i just focused on doing a good job and locating the pitches thankfully everything worked out
1727742 they could have scored more runs he had a rough day
1727743 well see in the next few days how much it means to us

1728106 tablet pcs offer teachers and students a natural way to deal with a wide range of academic possibilities
1728107 while traditional laptops are great for textual content they dont allow free hand input of content
1728108 however the real educational power of a tablet pc is leveraged by software systems that exploit the power of the pen for instance microsoft word allows teachers and students to make natural digital ink annotations on top of typed text this can be useful when students are engaged in peer reviews or when a teacher is providing feedback on a students writing
1728109 many schools are finding that the incremental expenses of adding pen functionality by upgrading from old fashioned laptops to tablet pcs is helpful in terms of maximizing overall return on investment from computers
1728110 to see how this can be true imagine building a school gymnasium without bleachers along the walls the resulting facility would be useful for physical education class and team practices but would not be of much value for competitions that attract crowds the initial extra expense associated with the bleachers makes the facility much more useful in the long run the logic is similar when considering the added expense of a tablet pc over a laptop paying a little more up front can increase the overall usefulness of the hardware investment

1728112 the posse foundation is an innovative scheme brought to fruition almost 20 years ago by deborah bial an education specialist who was troubled by the high failure rate of promising minority students recruited by top tier universities
1728113 this years crop of posse chicagos 72 scholarship winners will be heading to carleton college in minnesota depauw university in indiana denison university and oberlin college in ohio and pomona college in california as well as the university of illinois at urbana champaign and the university of wisconsin madison
1728114 the program which started off as a shoestring operation in new york has expanded into a well financed and highly praised organization with offices in six cities including chicago and an annual budget of 8 million to date some 2 200 posse foundation scholars have gone off to 28 universities with 220 million worth of full tuition scholarships in their pockets last year the john d and catherine t macarthur foundation awarded bial one of its genius grants for her work as an education innovator but the most significant measure of bials success is the 90 percent graduation rate of posse foundation scholars far higher than the national rate of about 50 percent for all freshman entering four year institutions
1728115 historically a lot of programs that aim to help these students are looking at whats wrong with them they are poor kids they are at risk kids they are kids from urban high schools we take a different approach were looking at whats right with them we are a strength based program

1728121 this essay starts from the premise that corporate interests have colonised the u s press its dominant institutions as well as its professional assumptions practices and routines
1728122 the colonisation of u s news media is especially problematic for working journalists that is while economic imperatives and commercial interests have long constrained journalistic autonomy the corporate consolidation of the news industry with the attendant demands for cost cutting on one hand and profit maximisation on the other has all but extinguished any semblance of a free press in the era of corporate colonisation the u s press corps finds it increasingly difficult to maintain its independence from direct and indirect corporate control
1728123 analysis of the journalistic philosophy and routines employed by daily news and public affairs program it is my contention that democracy now is at the vanguard of an emerging independent media sector that is revitalising u s news media at a decisive moment in american journalism history
1728124 its the idea of sacrifice for the greater good which is to make china look fantastic during the olympic period
1728125 look just beyond the plastered smiles of a welcoming nation and youll see signs of the sacrifices made for the games old neighborhoods have been demolished in one case to make way for a parking lot full of new cars for olympic big wigs how many people have been inconvenienced depends on whom you ask the government says 14 901 residents were relocated to make way for olympic venues a human rights group puts the number at 1 5 million the government has ordered polluting industries to close and even pulled the plug on some nightclubs for fear of presenting a less than pristine image

1728127 solomont a massachusetts based venture capitalist who describes himself as a big boston red sox fan said he has been pulling together investors who will pay off the ibls outstanding debts while at the same time paving the way for winter ball in israels negev desert and the resumption of six team summer play in 2009
1728128 the american investor said he could have suggested to the previous group of owners of the israel baseball league that they simply declare bankruptcy and then he could have started a new league fresh
1728129 solomont praised baras as a visionary who like those involved in manykinds of start up enterprises had inufficient inforrmation about the real costs
1728130 as a new owner he said he believes he must exercise
1728131 at the end of the hosting period larry baras informed us that some of the league investors money had not reached him and therefore he was returning to the u s to raise the money as promised he left us a cheque for the remaining debt dated september 9 2007
1728132 a few days before the payment date we were informed that there was still no money in the leagues account and we were told to wait until we received a confirmation from larry to deposit the cheque the debt that has been left is more than 170 000
1728133 we have held talks with larry and have been corresponding via email but the debt has not been paid yet
1728134 solomont the new owner said that baras now is out of the picture solomont said that he had not yet sent any money to hakfar hayarok but planned to make a good faith payment of 10 000 u
1728135 he said payment to the school might have been quicker but for two glitches that were not the schools fault the first was that the paperwork left to him didnt reflect requested additional services that the ibl received after the contract was signed secondly he said he at first had difficulty reconciling the numbers because he had been doing the calculations in dollars while the contract called for payment in shekalim the israeli currency has been growing stronger against the u s dollar in the last year solomont said he similarly will review invoices submitted by other creditors and will work his way through those debts

1728168 the indian government is saying that uncless there is an indian passport for the baby i cant take her to japan i spoke to my wife before the baby was born but she was confused as whether she wants to go to india or not and at this moment i cant tell what she is thinking however first we have to take an indian passport or nothing can be done
1728169 he is requesting the government of japan he has talked to the ministry there to solve the problem as the passport is not there it is impossible to take the baby to japan
1728170 and the question is whether that is fatigue if it doesnt get straightened out that is something we have to consider
1728171 i feel it is a right of women to be able to give birth safely and when a woman is hiv positive the baby can obviously have the virus transmitted before being born
1728172 i think this is a fundamental human right for every woman to have access to treatment and health care so this is something that im actually addressing and talking about while we are here

1728178 mining the database for partial matches is a radical departure from the original intent in establishing a forensic dna database
1728179 a move in this direction would undermine principles of privacy and fairness by placing scores of innocent people under lifelong genetic surveillance simply because they have a relative who has been convicted of a crime
1728180 the idea that forensic science is so precise that a false match between a sample and a suspect is a one in a billion occurrence is science fiction
1728181 this is the csi effect it causes us to overestimate the precision of the science and underestimate the incidence of human error

1728185 the rule was enacted for some companies last year after merrill lynch amp co morgan stanley goldman sachs group inc and citigroup argued to the financial accounting standards board that it wasnt fair to make them mark their assets to market value if they couldnt do the same for liabilities the paper profits have helped offset more than 160 billion of writedowns taken by u s financial services companies in the past year as of june 1

1728193 wall street firms including morgan stanley are ratcheting back on risks after the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and ensuing credit contraction saddled banks and brokerages with almost 500 billion of writedowns and losses
1728194 the planned divestment of reed business information is progressing and we are seeing strong buyer interest in the business

1728203 in response to the hand picked military jurys decision in the military commission against salim ahmed hamdan shayana kadidal senior managing attorney of the center for constitutional rights ccr guant namo global justice initiative issued the following statement
1728204 hamdans trial violated two of the most fundamental criminal justice principles accepted by all civilized nations the prohibition on the use of coerced evidence and the prohibition on retroactive criminal laws the decision to keep these cases out of the ordinary criminal courts will produce years of appeals over novel legal issues raised by the untested military commissions system even after those appeals are finished the process will never be seen as legitimate by the world this case was the first trial run of the commissions system and the decision proves nothing except that the system itself should be scrapped terrorism related crimes should be tried in the time tested domestic criminal justice system a system whose rules have been designed over the centuries with two goals to seek out the truth and secure justice
1728205 in my country we were in full boycott mode with public and political opinion moving towards a boycott and i think it was only the earthquake that diverted attention away from something that would have been very serious for us
1728206 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed more closely the result was that there was a crisis
1728207 there should be a resolutionto do away with the international portion of the torch relay
1728208 we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1728209 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again
1728210 the security agents of the basep presidential security battalion came to our home around 9 20 5 20 a m edt and took away my father
1728211 this partnership is the best of both worlds for me and my management team
1728212 we can keep control of our creative challenges and operations while accelerating our growth doing projects all over the world
1728213 they arrested him here and took him to the battalion base its a textbook coup detat
1728214 theres an intricate pattern in which this accused helped in the preparation of and transportation of the leadership that made this possible
1728215 theres no basis for charging the driver with war crimes for what adolf hitler and the senior leadership of the third reich did
1728216 the team is not at all unhappy with the results the mood upstairs was very upbeat
1728217 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests
1728218 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1728219 the hazmat team arrived and determined the lower explosive limit at the man hole was at the hundred level
1728220 the material given by the home ministry is insufficient so the ban cannot be continued
1728221 we hope the situation will be urgently solved staff need to be paid and indeed deserve to be paid for their work
1728222 which is a standard procedure to preserve the integrity of the funds
1728223 we want to ensure that donor funds are used for their intended purpose
1728224 our aim is to move forward with the work of the tribunal without sacrificing the integrity of the funds supporting it
1728225 this wasnt some print ad typo it was an obvious error that should have been caught before it was published to their public site and made available in the sales process
1728226 amazing that they dont have something in their fine print that covers them for web errors like that
1728227 we just hope whoever is responsible is getting the what for sorry people move along on this one
1728228 they shouldnt be here in the run up to the vote and afterward i dont need them
1728229 we want them to discuss human rights and not only focus on israel and turning this into an anti semitic event
1728230 we will attend the meeting only if there is a radical substantive change
1728231 ongoing israeli systematic perpetration of racist crimes including war crimes acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing
1728232 yes the europeans say it should not be anti semitic and the israelis are demanding a focus on human rights around the world
1728233 but what about those that did the bashing theyve said nothing

1728240 it seems to be a deliberate improper use of the emblem

1728244 somos todos parte de este tiempo de recuperaci n donde la nueva escuela t cnica ahora s es un elemento m s de esta recuperaci n y de esta gran oportunidad que tenemos los argentinos y los misioneros
1728245 quiero referirme a algo que lo tomo como un desaf o de cada instituci n y por sobre todas las cosas tomo a esta escuela como un prototipo y un modelo a seguir nada sirve en una sociedad si nos movemos en compartimientos estancos aislados unos de otros de nada sirve una escuela en el lugar que est si funciona aislada de su pueblo aislada de los padres de las empresas de los que tienen el rol de conducci n pol tica ese modelo de extensi n en el que la escuela abre sus puertas para integrarse a la comunidad abre sus puertas para salir puertas afuera y recibir puertas adentro a quienes pretendan capacitarse y educarse es el modelo que queremos profundizar y seguir
1728246 cuando uno escucha a un director que orgulloso dice que estas escuelas estas aulas se cierran a las once de la noche no me quedaba m s que el gesto de reconocimiento expresado con el aplauso esa apertura se ve m s all de los chicos que la reciban los padres los vecinos para que utilizando las herramientas adquieran la capacitaci n que en muchos casos les significar la salida laboral y la calidad de vida
1728247 en muchos casos cuando uno recorre la provincia me piden una escuela y yo tengo por esa visi n de que uno tiene que utilizar los recursos al m ximo una pregunta siempre a flor de labios no hay una escuela en la que puedan funcionar en turnos cruzados porque de eso tenemos que nutrirnos del aprovechamiento eficiente de los recursos como hacen ustedes en esta escuela o como lo hicieron de manera inteligente en el sal n municipal como lo hace ya nuevamente el intendente habilitando el sal n municipal pero pensando en otra casa de estudios siempre tenemos que utilizar los recursos que tenemos con la m s alta eficiencia la escuela no puede ser mezquina no puede estar cerrada la escuela debe ser un espacio social de capacitaci n de deporte de actividad un espacio por sobre todas las cosas donde el esfuerzo compartido sea uno de sus m s importantes valores
1728248 esta escuela dec a el director agradece tambi n a su cooperadora y es bueno que as sea no todas las escuelas de la provincia tienen cooperadora no s c mo andan los centros de estudiantes no todas los tienen y yo que surg a la pol tica en la militancia estudiantil secundaria siempre digo que el centro de estudiantes es extremadamente til seguro que es fundamental para la estudiantina para la carroza para las serenatas para lo que fuera pero tambi n es importante para ayudar al director para ayudar a la cooperadora para hacer un baile juntar recursos para el mobiliario para una computadora o para que fuera de ah surge el concepto de comunidad educativa donde todos tenemos algo para aportar algo para sumar
1728249 reci n entreg bamos tractores ac est el folleto y a m me llam la atenci n 236 546 pesos y es caro el tractor y a m no me gusta comprar caro ya saben en el gobierno que no me gusta comprar caro como todo en la vida yo creo que hay que hacer valer los recursos y hay que pagar el precio justo pero lo que pasa es que tractor es lo siguiente y les cuento para que vean c mo cambi y en qu argentina estamos viviendo estos recursos son nacionales s pero nos corresponden a nosotros porque formamos parte de esta naci n y porque los peleamos y porque los directores de las escuelas t cnicas han hecho su tarea y han presentado sus proyectos y entonces el ministro va al gobierno federal y trae estos recursos un tractor nuevo de 75 hp cuesta 76 690 pesos pero tambi n viene una cargadora frontal de uso agr cola una cabina especial para tractor un acoplado rural con dos ejes un acoplado jaula nuevo un acoplado tanque una desmalezadora de dos metros de ancho un rotovator arado una pulverizadora una trilladora y una cortadora y ah suman 236 000 pesos que significan tecnolog a aplicada para algo que es fundamental que es la oportunidad que tenemos como provincia la producci n de alimentos
1728250 los procesos qu micos los procesos normales que podamos tener en cada una de estas escuelas debemos concentrarlos a la producci n de alimentos el intendente de puerto rico es uno de los que m s trabaja junto al gobierno provincial para el desarrollo de distintas cuencas en esta zona la producci n de ganadera de derivados de la mandioca una cuenca lechera un fuerte impulso a la piscicultura y eso que podemos que podemos hacer en cada 50 100 500 o mil metros cuadrados que tengamos de nuestras chacras las huertas para abastecer primero el autoconsumo y luego porqu no el mercado de puerto rico el mercado de eldorado o de posadas
1728251 were looking at fundamental science fundamental mathematics that in many ways are a mess of jumbled data
1728252 we try to give them a structure because as humans we make these inferences so much better when our data has structure
1728253 then an investigator needs to put this all together and connect the dots find the coherent story
1728254 with pressure on resources and a drive to provide more remote support realvnc saves us time and money and means that we can keep critical it systems up and running with minimum delays vnc also provides reporting functions
1728255 vnc is used by millions of users worldwide and is already a highly popular tool for desktop support and helpdesks for the health service vnc provides a robust secure scalable and cost effective solution for very distributed it environments and supports a wide range of different users many with limited it skills
1728256 there is a significant possibility that braid would have been the next psychonauts or beyond good and evil critically acclaimed but nobody played it even at usd 10 if that happens at usd 10 then i am in debt and have to get a job and cant make games any more if that happens at usd 15 maybe i can still make games that is the difference
1728257 and again i dont know if i would have been able to convince microsoft to release the game at 800 points anyway so it seemed my best move was to make the agreement and keep a good relationship with them
1728258 well he s latino if no one claims him in two days ship em to guadalajara i hear they have great neurosurgery
1728259 i think we need to drop another 30 or 40 cents a gallon before we really see any change in driving habits
1728260 the current situation in south ossetia is uneasy and it needs measures to lower the confrontations
1728261 we have information that two georgian military vehicles have been blown up
1728262 if you want to know what your future will be like look at your habits now
1728263 what if the hokey pokey is what it s all about
1728264 what can i learn from this to move myself forward from here
1728265 mauritania had been seen as a relative success following the restoration of an elected government following another coup this news will come as a setback to perceptions of improved governance it should also result in some focus on the political stability of africas new oil economies more broadly a timely reminder of what is at stake and the risks not favourable for investor sentiment
1728266 in terms of aid it may imperil aid from foreign institutions at least in the short term
1728267 there were rumours about two weeks ago that might be a coup in the offing it was a bit of an open secret that two senior military commanders were fanning this split within the ruling party in the last few days there had been rumours they had decided to pull back but the presidents decision to dismiss two senior generals appears to have prompted the coup
1728268 this new democracy hasnt really been given a chance i think a lot of expectations have been put on the government and granted that a year has passed but that is not enough time to judge
1728269 he is a member of our new box busters working group
1728270 this reminds me a little bit of when you had some skunkworks groups operating here
1728271 at first i must admit i was a little offended that the employees felt they needed to conduct their innovative thinking exercises without my involvement but i quickly realized they were just trying to make the company better so we decided the corporation would sponsor the skunkworks groups
1728272 we re putting together a product rollout that will be unlike anything this company has ever seen
1728273 where the usual procedure takes two years ours will take three months we ve streamlined the design process accelerated the approval process and radically altered the interdepartmental input procedures
1728274 and you re going to be able to bring this product to market without having to take all those conventional steps
1728275 management will of course conduct a thorough review of all this
1728276 we value very highly the efforts of the box busters they re our stars they re our difference makers prudence of course requires us to give any product rollout careful thought
1728277 if they let the box busters actually work pretty soon the whole company would turn into a box busters group and then do you know what would happen
1728278 the first assignment of the corporatewide box busters would be to build a new better box
1728279 im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs
1728280 the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures
1728281 our goal is firm and it is that the korean peninsula must be denuclearized if we work with patience and consistency verification can be done perfectly and i believe north korea should cooperate on this
1728282 theyve got a lot to do theyve got to show us a verification regime that we can trust
1728283 this is a step by step process i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1728284 they will both highlight the need for continued international attention and pressure on the junta
1728285 the united states is committed to helping the people of burma recover from the devastation of cyclone nargis but we will also continue sanctions against the regime and its cronies
1728286 oh we didnt realise it was a rip off well remove it now
1728287 its a work of art with no hidden function at all
1728288 today down payment assistance is a popular choice for many credit worthy home buyers who dont have all of the required downpayment in savings for conventional or fha financing the elimination of these programs combined with the already tightened lending standards will have an immediate and negative impact on the entry level market
1728289 although we are dissapointed about the impacts of this new law syncon homes will continue to focus on our core values of quality customer service and superior home building methods for which we have received national recognition we will also continue to help prospective buyers take advantage of these down payment assistance programs until they are eliminated
1728290 this is not perfect legislation the first step is what we have before us today so that we maintain important provisions in our gun registration law while we continue to look at how we can further refine our gun registration law
1728291 the handgun ban and the trigger lock requirement as applied to self defense violate the second amendment similarly the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self defense and is hence unconstitutional
1728292 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but could we save all the oil that they re talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you d actually save just as much
1728293 es kann nicht angehen dass kr fte mit kombattantem status zivile polizeiliche aufgaben bernehmen und die polizei belasten nur weil die landesregierung im streit um die innere sicherheit offenbar nicht mehr den politischen willen hat eine klare trennung zwischen dem gewaltenmonopol von polizei und milit r aufrechtzuerhalten der vspb verlangt vom bundesrat dass der polizeiliche bereich der inneren sicherheit nach wie vor von polizistinnen und polizisten wahrgenommen wird die daf r ausgebildet sind und nebst den beruflichen auch ber entsprechende soziale kompetenzen verf gen
1728294 wir leider ganz andere erkenntnisse ber gewalt haben auch bei der wm in deutschland gab es viel gewalt und alles wurde verschwiegen deswegen sind wir hier
1728295 f r die sicherheit der euro war unter gro er mitwirkung des sterreichischen bundesheeres gesorgt
1728296 weve been working about the last four months and theres a good bulk of music and a good body of work so far and were having fun and you know were taking our time and trying to figure out where william fits in and where we need to step up and i have all the confidence in the world in the guys
1728297 the most important thing to me is that were all together and you know its been a tough and painful experience at times but its been very rewarding at the same time
1728298 the church rejoices and is proud of the vast majority of her priests who are good and extremely praiseworthy
1728299 she knows and explicitly recognizes that the vast majority of our priests despite their human weaknesses and limits are decent priests who give their lives every day to the kingdom of god who love jesus christ and the people entrusted to them they are priests who are sanctified in the daily exercise of their ministry who persevere until the end in the harvest of the lord
1728300 its true there is a small percentage of priests who go astray sometimes gravely but the church desires to repair the evil they have done
1728301 in the regions and environments where the christian faith was preached centuries ago
1728302 it is a mission or missionary evangelization within our own flock meant for those who we baptized but for different reasons we did not sufficiently evangelize or who lost their initial fervor and went astray
1728303 is relativistic secularized and agnostic also has a strong erosive effect on the religious faith of many
1728304 the church by nature is missionary the church knows that she cannot stay at home and limit herself to welcoming and evangelizing those who seek her in their communities and parishes
1728305 it is essential we get up and go in search in the places where people and families reside live and work all members of the ecclesial community pastors religious and the laity are called to this mission
1728306 and they gathered them together to the place called in hebrew armageddon
1728307 are of one mind and they will give their power and authority to the beast
1728308 to the battle of that great day of god almighty to the place called armageddon
1728309 to the battle of that great day of god almighty
1728310 behold the day of the lord is coming for i will gather all the nations to battle against jerusalem then the lord will go forth and fight against those nations as he fights in the day of battle and in that day his feet will stand on the mount of olives which faces jerusalem on the east
1728311 it is surprising that no one has suggested taking magedon as deriving from the secondary sense of the hebrew gadad that means to gather in troops or bands the simple way in hebrew to make a noun from a verb is to prefix a ma to the verbal form thus we have maged a place of gathering in troops and the suffix o meaning his yielding his place of gathering troops this is almost equivalent to the expressions in vss 14 16 to gather them the kings and their armies for the battle on the great day of god almighty and would allude to the prophetic expectation of the gathering of the nations for judgment
1728312 let the nations be wakened and come up to jerusalem to the valley of jehoshaphat for there i will sit to judge all the surrounding nations put in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come go down for the winepress is full the vats overflow for their wickedness is great multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the lord is near in the valley of decision
1728313 now out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should strike the nations he himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god
1728314 for from the rising of the sun even to its going down my name shall be great among the gentiles nations in every place incense shall be offered to my name and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the nations says the lord of hosts
1728315 if a trader is chargeable to both employment income and trading income then only the gross monies earned from the work chargeable under trading income should be considered as being potentially subject to vat and for which registration may be appropriate
1728316 to tax all of a persons income as chargeable under either employment income or trading income for administrative convenience even though that person may receive income of both types there will be instances where a trader argues for a different vat status from their direct tax status and in other instances the personal tax status of a person may be unknown or undecided however on all these occasions you will need to examine the contracts that have been entered into to decide which are contracts of service employment and which are contracts for services self employment
1728317 where entitlement to a minimum wage exists because of the rights a worker has under the national minimum wage act 1998 it does not mean that he she necessarily works under a contract of employment employed workers and some self employed workers are covered by the act however the national minimum wage act provides that qualifying workers are entitled under their contract to be paid at a rate equivalent to the national minimum wage the right to be paid at a rate equivalent to the minimum wage becomes an implied term in the workers contract
1728318 i m choosing to do x even though y would serve me better
1728319 the entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming
1728320 whatever slight impact humans might have on the climate it is too small to measure
1728321 lower atmosphere satellite based temperature measurements if corrected for non greenhouse influences such as el nino events and large volcanic eruptions show little if any global warming since 1979 a period over which atmospheric co2 has increased by 55 ppm 17 percent
1728322 the signature of an increased greenhouse effect is a hot spot about 10km up in the atmosphere over the tropics the greenhouse signature is missing we have been looking and measuring for years and cannot find it
1728323 there is no evidence to support the idea that carbon emissions cause significant global warming
1728324 the satellites that measure the worlds temperature all say that the warming trend ended in 2001 and that the temperature has dropped about 0 6c in the past year
1728325 none of these points is controversial the alarmist scientists agree with them though they would dispute their relevance
1728326 a loose knit network of entertainers who share common beliefs like supporting u s troops and traditional american values
1728327 functioned like a support group organizing informal gatherings where actors producers screenwriters key grips and other industry types can share common values or discuss concerns like anti americanism in hollywood movies or the perception of industry bias
1728328 if the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years left no more bees no more pollination no more plants no more animals no more man

1728337 creating opportunities for taxpayers to reduce their tax liability and social security contributions by converting income from labour into income from capital
1728338 is relevant only for owner managed businesses at the smallest end of the business sector
1728339 as discussed in griffith hines and sorensen in this book there are theoretical and pragmatic arguments to support a differential
1728340 in reality it seems clear that in practice the bullying of small firms by large is endemic in a market economy and as times get hard it gets worse
1728341 there may be market failures that affect some small firms
1728342 we bosses of our language english is boss of english users
1728343 everybody know jeans or trousers always one thing you cant wear many jean or plural trouser
1728344 chinese we starting sentence from concept of time or place
1728345 it is rich people taking advantage of poor people by lending them money on terms that are sure to fail people of great wealth and their institutions like banks naturally have the power to overwhelm people of lesser means and you can t allow that in a decent society it won t survive
1728346 where were the gatekeepers where were the watchdogs why did it take the fed so long to put an end to the predatory practices
1728347 secrets of the temple how the federal reserve runs the country
1728348 to make the story overly crude the u s congress repealed the law against usury it was done in 1980 by a democratic congress with a democratic president jimmy carter and of course the republicans all piled on and voted for it and that was the first stroke only the first of many in which they stripped away the regulatory laws from the financial system and from banking they set up a political climate that shouted let s get government out of the way and that was very appealing as framed by president ronald reagan and other conservatives
1728349 greenspan s bubbles the age of ignorance at the federal reserve
1728350 you had this very powerful industrial sector banking and finance that wanted and had pushed for years to get out from under the regulatory controls limits on interest rates the law against usury the merger of commercial banks with investment banks which had been prohibited in the new deal because it caused the disaster of 1929 during the last generation 25 30 years ago the fed the central bank that regulates money and credit tipped hard in one direction towards capital in favor of capital and against labor
1728351 even harder for debt ridden people to wipe clean their financial slates by declaring bankruptcy
1728352 so at the same time the fed was helping to keep wages down in order to keep inflation from escalating its policies were nonetheless helping banks and investors to inflate the cost of the value of their assets beyond reality right
1728353 that s it at one point writing in the nation i somewhat playfully and wickedly referred to alan greenspan the fed chairman as the one eyed chairman
1728354 the point i want to make though is that it is deeper than a politician rolling over for his campaign contributor the guys who finance the democratic party or the republican party they do that too but they were sold a fantasy an illusion which sounded wonderful about how markets make better judgments than government and the public and that liberating finance and business from prudential rules that society imposes upon them will produce a bigger better economy and better returns for everyone all those fantasies have been destroyed by these events i mean wiped out
1728355 a better metaphor instead of putting them to sleep would be castration
1728356 the trillion dollar meltdown easy money high rollers and the great credit crash
1728357 who will tell the people the betrayal of american democracy
1728358 the soul of capitalism opening paths to a moral economy
1728359 we are all here on earth to make this a better place and improve the human condition when you have had the opportunity in your life to be successful that comes with the responsibility to reach out and help others this is one of edicts we live by
1728360 we believe providing fully loaded housing to well deserving horatio alger scholars can help foster an environment conducive to learning and living well ensuring a firmer footing for their future
1728361 the main argument is that when people arrive into israel who are in danger it is illegal under israeli law to deport them this comes from former supreme court justice avraham baraks 1995 ruling in the altai case involving someone from iraq who was in israel seeking asylum which stated that israel cant deport somehone whose life is in danger according to the refugee convention and also according to israels basic law on human dignity which requires any israeli to take into account the value of human life and human freedom
1728362 under its rules you cant send back someone to a place where they can be tortured
1728363 yes its possible in the west bank but if you know that these people wont be tortured in the west bank then its ok to send them there
1728364 be deported back to gaza unless they wanted to go there
1728365 in the petition acri attorney oded feller said the lives of those who are being sent back to gaza is at risk adding that sending back people who request political asylum to the place they had escaped from constitutes one of the most severe human rights violations and is a breach of israeli law and human morality
1728366 protected persons i e living under occupation and in this case a belligerent military operation according to many international law experts
1728367 they ran to the fence and hamas was shooting at them that is enough
1728368 there was no time to speak with each of them or to collect affadavits
1728369 it s not a theoretical case but of human beings and their lives
1728370 according to israeli law there is a decision to see erez and other crossings from gaza into israel as border control areas the entrance to israel law gives a list of international crossing points into israel like ben gurion airport and like taba erez is also one this happened after 2005 but qalandia crossing into the west bank is not on this list
1728371 the control of the idf and security forces in jericho is absolute and anyone who deviates from normative behavior and engages in criminal activity or terror will be removed from there quickly i explained to them the difference between gaza and the west bank and how they will need to behave differently none of them are saints but none of them are mega terrorists either and each and every one of them was checked by the shin bet
1728372 states decision today granting 150 fatah supporters refuge in the west bank following the organizations petition against sending them back to the conflict ridden gaza strip another 38 returned to gaza on their own will according to the israel defense forces
1728373 would directly violate the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees to which israel is a signatory most specifically the notion of non refoulement which prevents states from sending asylum seekers into life endangering situations we are pleased with the states decision to abide by its legal commitments to safeguard these individuals lives and freedom said acri attorney oded feller who submitted the petition but besides the legal ramifications it would have been highly immoral for israel to send them or any other asylum seekers back to a place where they would most likely face injury and even death
1728374 the checkpoints and visits to police stations taught me this business
1728375 there is a lot of corruption and bureaucracy in the offices you cannot have any service done for you unless you have money or girls to offer as a bribe
1728376 because i took girls to them i have been able to free prisoners from jail i have had work done for me by the civic registry office and the passport office
1728377 there are more than 200 brothels in kirkuk in each of these there are between two and six prostitutes i started this business after the downfall of saddam hussain in 2003
1728378 most of the girls drink alcohol they also take drugs
1728379 i am always sad i am depressed when i come home i either drink or take drugs
1728380 i am sacred that my brothers will find and kill me
1728381 sometimes high ranking police officers phone me and threaten me because i have not taken girls to them for free
1728382 they took away a girl named nura allegedly because she was under arrest after some time nura came back she said they had raped her at the police station
1728383 they also harass us a lot i change my place every month
1728384 i belong to one of the political parties i work for them i have handed over three terrorists to them so far
1728385 the terrorists have come here several times and taken away girls for sex
1728386 a number of officials have come here from sulaymaniyah and arbil they have taken away girls for one week ten days or two weeks for us 700 to us 800 we have the names of those military officials of sulaymaniyah and arbil who have taken away girls for sex most of the customers are military officers police and security men
1728387 the girls are often beaten and harmed especially by security men puk s security men are the worst
1728388 there is no neighbourhood in kirkuk that does not have one or two brothels even in the kurdish suburbs like shorija rahimawa and iskan they have special houses but the prostitutes are mostly arabs and they have come here from the middle and south of iraq
1728389 this girl is coming back from syria she got married there a month ago
1728390 there are many women in kirkuk with aids but no one gives a damn about them
1728391 my girls all use medicine and are clean i do not take girls who have got aids
1728392 such as hotel nergis hotel jihan hotel ta mim hotel diwan and others they work at night and go home at day time
1728393 in the past few months some prostitutes were at the removal section of the police then they were sentenced to life but they were all covered by the general amnesty and some are under 18 for example a girl called huda musa she was from mosul and she was only 15 years old
1728394 huda was taken out by three boys police arrested them they freed the boys without any charges but huda and her dalal mediator were sentenced to 15 years then they were freed by a general amnesty however given the size of prostitution in kirkuk only few of women are arrested
1728395 the main factor behind prostitution is poverty and family problems these girls fail in their lives and resort to prostitution
1728396 then when they grow up they want to meet their living needs through a work that does not need much effort
1728397 but deprivation is not the only reason for prostitution there are many deprived women who do not resort to this solution but the women who choose prostitution like it
1728398 once you chose to sell your body then nothing else in life is important to you you would do anything
1728399 you mean this thing im wearing its ages old and not that great

1728858 a lot of the reasons why a dentist office smells the ways it does is because of the chemicals needed to develop an x ray
1728859 lets face it people can go online and learn in a few hours how to read an x ray this allows them to dialogue with their dentist and improve patient relations by communicating
1728860 its not in the hands of the people not only that special crew that was there last night but those afterward who might respond
1728861 i was also very pleased with the tone of the dialogue
1728862 there was a willingness to listen and be tolerant of differing views sometimes there was a playful antagonism but there was also accommodation it was a very canadian style dialogue underneath it all there was a sense of a need for conciliation
1728863 what im hoping to do tonight is explore our common experiences and try to look towards a future of parrsboro and for common solutions
1728864 like many of you im concerned about the future of parrsboro i think every single one of us shares that concern and we may come at it from different directions so what i think is possible tonight is that by teasing out these differences and listening to each other we can try to perhaps come to a consensus on what parrsboro could be and should be five 10 and 20 years from now
1728865 there are a lot of great things here but if someone is not interested right away and there is no vitality when they drive in they get their coffee and they drive out
1728866 we need to celebrate more about what is here we cant ask people to dig for it we have to give it to them
1728867 right now you ask each other what do you want to do and theres nothing to do
1728868 it should be what do you want to do next there should always be something to do this is a beautiful town for the older generation but the youth are going to be the older generation and you have to keep them happy in order to keep the town going
1728869 a lot of people really dont think they would be allowed to do that and maybe we need to encourage people more and let them know we are a town that wants to showcase our talent

1728879 all our guys were in favour of it 100 per cent
1728880 the strategy that was tried last year of trying to pass one bill that was going to fix everything its not practical
1728881 its not going to happen you have to compromise on every single section of that bill to the point where youre going to get a mediocre attempt at a solution
1728882 its probably going to take at least a couple of decades to get us where we need to be long term
1728883 we need to have rational immigration quotas that are pegged to specific industries at certain times of the year
1728884 there ought to be a formula driven annual quota for temporary immigration work visas
1728885 the h1b visa issue has been abused resulting in jobs being lost here in this country
1728886 udalls cosponsored legislation that would expand the cap on legal immigrant worker visas h1b and h2b visa programs and bob schaffer has been on both sides of this issue
1728887 its not really clear where schaffer is he has argued against it and hes argued for it now hes trying to say hes for it because he knows hes in a place where people are looking for solutions
1728888 to the extent that schaffers been asked to talk about his solution on the immigration problem he points to the marianas islands where they have a major problem with virtual slave labor and that hes only aware of because of his abramoff sponsored junket there
1728889 udalls voting record is against efforts to try to secure the border it is in favor of providing cash incentives for those who are here illegally using your money to pay for college tuition for people from france who want a cheap college education in america
1728890 people are looking for a real and comprehensive solution on this immigration problem and bob schaffer is admitting he doesnt have that plan so between that and the totally false attacks on marks record im not sure thats the kind of leadership coloradans are looking for
1728891 if you were more discerning you d probably buy this book if you do read this book you will be this book on discernment is simple clear well written and well illustrated
1728892 hello tim i read your review after i had already read the shack and i think your review is ridiculous your review reminds me of exactly why stodgy old religion is so unappealing to masses of people william young wrote a novel a story that inspired me and thousands of others to want to have a closer more intimate relationship with god all your theological arguments cant erase that
1728893 i was surprised that he seemed not as concerned due to the fact that it is a novel and so some leeway should be allowed for poetic license
1728894 william young wrote a novel a story that inspired me and thousands of others to want to have a closer more intimate relationship with god all your theological arguments cant erase that
1728895 readers are talking about the shack for its theology and its storyline not for its faulty mechanics reviewers have criticized the book for hinting at universalism as well as for feminism and a lack of hierarchy in the trinity rather than slicing and dicing the novel looking for proof of theological missteps a better approach might be to look at significant passages as springboards for deeper discussion the shack is a novel after all not a systematic theology
1728896 i don t believe anyone who loves god and is born again by the spirit of god could love this book how can someone enjoy a work that defames and perverts gods character
1728897 the shack is a novel after all not a systematic theology
1728898 i thank the father in heaven for permitting to be raised in such a wonderful decade of music i mean does any other genre compare maybe but this one is mine thank you lord
1728899 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
1728900 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
1728901 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain
1728902 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1728903 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1728904 flags 24 7 but wait how many stripes does the fourth flag image have
1728905 no link between our tiny little study and the ccd phenomenon anything else said or written is a lie
1728906 do we want to add the stress of dieting on top of that
1728907 many of the investigators including myself were surprised by the results
1728908 were continually researching new treatments but sometimes the tried and true methods are still the best course these findings substantiate the importance of laser treatment in the management of diabetic macular edema
1728909 prior studies have looked at atrial fibrillation in young and middle aged and generally healthy people
1728910 they found that for example marathon runners have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation but the vast majority of atrial fibrillation occurs later in life after 65 about one in five people develops atrial fibrillation over 10 years
1728911 no one has looked at exercise and atrial fibrillation in these older people
1728912 we found that light to moderate exercise such as walking 10 blocks a week was associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation
1728913 we have enrolled patients who have atrial fibrillation already to see whether exercise improves their quality of life
1728914 preliminary data appears to be that they feel better and function better
1728915 there are additional strong reasons for the public to focus on exercise
1728916 mothers of young children in the united states are in a rather untenable situation
1728917 mothers are so isolated in our society there is not an appreciation for the extent to which this is a very challenging time for this large population
1728918 we were surprised at how quickly the women were back to employment over 80 percent by 12 weeks postpartum
1728919 they didnt get the maternity leave that they wanted they felt they had to be back at work earlier than they wanted they werent able to achieve their breast feeding goals
1728920 they are trying to do the right thing but they are not getting the support they need in terms of time to recover and the financial support they need to be at home with their babies
1728921 there is a major awareness challenge we arent really aware of the situation that mothers are in
1728922 we need to extend the supports we have offered to mothers we need to build awareness among women that they are not alone these are common issues issues for which they can get help they are entitled to help
1728923 most women dont exist within extended families and need other forms of support because there is not an extended family that can pick up the extra responsibility
1728924 that would be very helpful in reducing the level of stress
1728925 with all the emphasis on appropriate parenting there is pressure on women to be 100 percent available which is simply not possible womens expectations have increased dramatically
1728926 especially when there is a disconnect between how one thinks a mother is supposed to behave and how grueling it actually is that sets up people for disappointment and feelings of inadequacy it does create stress
1728927 get all the support you can muster if you pay for it or recruit various family members and friends the first year in a childs life is very demanding one needs a lot of support and one also needs to take care of oneself
1728928 mispronunciation is more than a challenge its also a danger
1728929 if you pronounce it wrong you may end up with the wrong drug
1728930 as drugs proliferate they start to sound alike like celexa and celebrex
1728931 its just going to get worse with increases in the number of drugs and in the number of unfamiliar names
1728932 as far as pronunciation of words my experience is that its pretty much all over the place
1728933 even if you were pronouncing something correctly if you had a really deep southern drawl its not going to sound the same or if you come in with an english accent or a french accent or a texas accent you may be pronouncing it correctly but its not going to sound the same
1728934 i thought this guys just mispronouncing this terribly and hes the speaker but he actually studied under the guy who discovered the drug
1728935 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1728936 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1728937 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1728938 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services including psychotherapy
1728939 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community mental health centers
1728940 we know that for depression the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy leads to better outcomes
1728941 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1728942 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive

1728959 now that the show will be held in las vegas for a few more years we welcome crossvegas and swagger in making the city famous for great cycling events
1728960 with the addition of the wheelers and dealers race and the shuttle buses from the sands crossvegas is an even bigger part of the interbike experience
1728961 nobody should show up at interbike the day after the race and hear the words you shouldve been there
1728962 last years industry cup had some fierce racing with ex pros manufacturers independent reps and shop owners and staff racing each other
1728963 this year i wonder if last years racers and any new comers are willing to put their money where their mouths are and show us whos the fastest
1728964 yeah but im kind of like that guy in that show the one who works in the restaurant whos got his whole life coming down on him but ends up making it all happen for himself anyhow

1728978 this is all about getting balentien up here period we didnt want to give him a september only look in doing that we needed to create a roster spot and jose was that spot
1728979 im not surprised at all but its disappointing because i take a lot of pride in what i do
1728980 hes very smart and he understands schemes and what were trying to get done on defense and how offenses are trying to attack us hes very disciplined with his eyes so he reacts very quickly and so hes just a very efficient player he makes very few mistakes and makes a lot of plays
1728981 i think they are more intense more strict they expect more from us

1728986 by the greater number of workers simultaneously employed by the same individual capital it is merely an enlargement of the workshop of the master craftsman of the guilds
1728987 a large number of workers working together at the same time in one place in order to produce the same sort of commodity under the command of the same capitalist constitutes the starting point of capitalist production this is true both historically and conceptually

1729330 extending terms to four years might suit some communities but im not sure it would suit kelowna kelowna is a changing community going through lots of development the demand for infrastructure is never ending
1729331 i believe a three year term is a good balance it gives us the best of both worlds
1729332 having been a new councillor last year knowing it takes a year to really get up to speed my personal opinion is that a four year term makes more sense there is just so much to learn in the first year then there is just about one year to do the work and then in the third year its like election fever kicks in and everyone goes into election mode
1729333 im happy with whatever is decided its certainly a good topic to discuss there is a financial benefit for a community to have elections every four years instead of three but thats also longer for people to commit their time

1729374 just a couple more questions dear i know its been a long day for you lets see here
1729375 dear your mother has been very uneasy about having to lie to you we warned her that it was imperative that we know you are making steady progress before we issue you any information that could be potentially upsetting to you
1729376 you seem to have blocked out the last three or so years of your life
1729377 well about two years ago you actually left your boyfriend matt for your current fianc his name is mark he loves you dearly
1729378 i want to talk to matt did something happen to him where is he

1729380 honey i didnt know how to tell you the doctors told me that it was important that i allow them to make the decisions based on your progress
1729381 what do you want me to say mom what am i supposed to do
1729382 i know honey do you want to talk to mark hes been dying to see you but the doctors were apprehensive
1729383 well maybe itll help jolt your memory i dont know honey maybe its worth a try

1729385 kab bin ashraf and others who were killed during the time of the prophet were not killed by the common islamic law as clarified above they were killed by god through his own law
1729386 does it mean gods law does not demand trial and is thus unfair and unjust if not then do you mean to say that islamic law is inferior to gods law if yes then what is wrong with muslims wanting to follow gods law instead of islmic law as interpreted by you
1729387 ask them to bring a book more true than these two books i e quran and torah i will be the first to follow it if you are really truthful in your claim
1729388 why then was it badly misunderstood in some of its vital teachings by even the most devoted of its readers
1729389 if one were to seek the truth one would get it if one were not to seek it one would not get it
1729390 if an individual has gone against the truth completely and is not interested to know it he will not get to know it by any means
1729391 among the people of the book jews and christians there are those who if you trust them with a treasure will return it to you and among them there are those who if you trust them with a dinar will not return it to you unless you keep standing over them
1729392 they are not all alike among the people of the book there is a party who stand by their covenant they recite the word of god in the hours of night and prostrate themselves before him they believe in god and the last day and enjoin good and forbid evil and hasten to vie with one another in good works and these are among the righteous
1729393 and surely among the people of the book there are some who truly believe in god and in what has been sent down to you and in what was sent down to them humbling themselves before allah they trade not the signs of god for a paltry price it is these who shall have their reward with their lord surely god is swift in settling account
1729394 they the people of the book recognize him the prophet the way they recognize their children
1729395 and they the disbelieving non muslims denied them the signs brought by prophet moses even though they were convinced about their truthfulness out of unfairness and arrogance
1729396 why should it matter to the almighty the creator of the universe if some human being does not believe in him for a correct perspective just try comparing the whole being of a human to that of universe if you do you may start wondering if the creator of this universe is even aware of the existence of an individual human being

1729444 a lot of chairs ive seen have been made out of pvc and theyve said it can be made from recycled pvc itself or it can be recycled but really recycling is a whole other process that is not earth friendly you have to go through a lot of energy to get it recycled

1729513 weve chatted quite a bit around the office about whether or not to remove ones socks during sessions of sexual gratification and were pretty well divided i happen to think its adorable when people get their rocks off with their socks on and when newcomer tina b does it youll probably have the same sentiments
1729514 our lighting is tasteful and soft and our camerawork departs from the porn standard of gratuitous pussy shots and segementation of the body instead we choose to focus on the holistic bodily experience of orgasm from the slight tremble of the lip to the curl of the toes to the satisfied post orgasmic stretch
1729515 ifm dedicates itself to female pleasure in its myriad forms we present the female orgasm as a point of focus and we want to represent it in a way that does justice to its beauty and idiosyncrasy too often we are exposed to images of eroticism that ignore or trivialise the female orgasm and its our aim to counteract that imagery by providing a confident affirming and sexy alternative
1729516 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george coming back tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationary and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals saying you may not like this but here is our next mission and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish ultimately people even talked about it after the fact it was a dark day for the cia it was the kind of thing where they said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forward a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency

1729518 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it does include a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution what ive said is im willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1729519 i call on senator obama to call on congress to come back into town and come back to work come off their recess come off their vacation and address this energy challenge to america and dont leave until we do republican and democrat joining together and a very vital part of that is nuclear power and another vital part of that is offshore drilling we have to drill here and drill now
1729520 im not satisfied in part because i think they havent been as forthcoming not only with me but with the american people about the status of this investigation i also havent seen the evidence and i think that given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical

1729529 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
1729530 i have to hang up right now and dont ever call me again
1729531 this should be clear that this report is not just going to lie down put into some store somewhere its a report thats going to be used its a report that is going to help in bringing to justice or in making attempts very serious attempts to bring to justice people that were involved in committing genocide in this country
1729532 this is a story of much greater significance than just my sister or one woman her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was ever accused of
1729533 everything interfaces with security influences it and is influenced by it we must remember that it will all be meaningless if israel should be weak vulnerable and surrounded by enemies
1729534 the report was aiming to assess the conservation status of all primates so 634 species and the findings of the report are very very worrying for the conservation of primates 48 percent were classified as being threatened with extinction and thats an unprecedented rate among species and groups of species that have been assessed in the past
1729535 come fai a starci vicino una snob se la crede troppo per i miei gusti
1729536 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
1729537 well you know maybe if youre going all the time to congress you would like to represent to go for some of our states that dont have the money or time to send somebody to d c
1729538 better known as sean and montgomery mcfate a successful washington couple
1729539 whose current bios make no mention of any past intelligence gathering or opposition research work sean is currently the program director of the national security initiative at the bipartisan policy center
1729540 made a name for herself as one of the primary architects of the us militarys human terrain program which teams social scientists with military units in iraq and afghanistan to help soldiers better understand the local culture
1729541 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
1729542 the epidemic is far from over let me repeat the epidemic is far from over and we are going to be in this for the long haul first and foremost we must do a much better job of prevention this is the only way to get ahead and ensure an adequate long term response
1729543 homophobia is a societal sickness which impedes development limits expression and human rights such is the hatred for hiv aids that public health policy has been significantly slowed
1729544 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
1729545 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1729546 and some of those tactics very frankly you mention the war in iraq are somewhat like that we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement
1729547 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
1729548 what we have today could in no way be described as a democracy today we have an oligarchy power limited to a closed circle
1729549 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead and were talking about attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomenon but a phenomenon that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st pete police and the jena six and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
1729550 ive been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the united states senate and worked to pass legislation to prevent it when i was in the state legislature and i have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target african american and latino communities ive said that repeatedly number two jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that theres an injustice thats been done and we need to change it thats number two when sean bell got shot i put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem
1729551 all the print media has moved to colour when you read your newspaper its in colour i dont believe the industry will accept going back to a black and white format just to embrace the new technology
1729552 the technology has to move the printed image on somewhat and add some usability and user value
1729553 the first application will be as electronic labels for supermarkets and that will start next year with much smaller screens but the same technology in colour
1729554 its probably two years away before we can get the screen manufacturing technology up to scratch for an a5 or bigger size in colour that is when we can talk about distributing magazines and so forth on it
1729555 the way to make a success of this market is through a collaboration its not just a product market where we make the screens and someone else integrates than and sells them to a third party who distributes media on them
1729556 much better to have all the elements of that business together from the start to make sure the end product and the end distribution is viable
1729557 lcd is much better at the moment for moving images the update on here is relatively slow about one second or so thats ok for flicking through the pages of a book or newspaper but it would not be any good for video in its current state
1729558 the technology is very similar to lcd screen technology except with a conventional lcd screen as soon as you remove the power the image goes
1729559 with this once the screen has set the image it says there forever with an a5 size screen i could change the image every two seconds for more than a year from the power in a single aaa battery

1729578 now we are just manning the phones and trying to get an update on what is happening with him
1729579 it will be nice just to get a few words with him if we can that is the first thing we are looking toward
1729580 we havent made any plans to go out there as yet but if it is required we will be there

1729592 make sure our applicants graduated from an accredited school before we hire them
1729593 old problems assume new dimensions information operations with emphasis on a cyber domain asymmetric political or military responses trafficking lastly we confront the challenge of acting in an environment that is more time sensitive and open to the flow of information in which intelligence sources and analysis compete in a public context established by a global media a wide array of threats and risks
1729594 the opportunity now exists to tap into a vastly larger amount of expertise than was previously available to intelligence
1729595 i dont know whether this is the right person or not
1729596 i dont know if well hear anything from them that will convince me that theyve gotten to the bottom of it
1729597 the fbi apparently applied a lot of pressure to all the investigators there at detrick and they found the weakest link
1729598 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
1729599 one of the reasons they need to lay this out is so that the public can be confident that they are protected
1729600 the post office workers the general public the local police they are all owed an explanation they would like to have closure
1729601 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1729602 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1729603 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1729604 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1729605 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains
1729606 we must end the age of oil in our time
1729607 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
1729608 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
1729609 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
1729610 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
1729611 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
1729612 he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
1729613 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president

1729619 paying more to gas up your car may mean paying less to insure it
1729620 higher gas prices lead to less driving and as new yorkers drive less the number of accidents should go down
1729621 geico is to be commended for its decision to withdraw its rate increase request based on how changes in driver habits in new york affected its recent loss experience we hope other insurers will also carefully evaluate the effects of reduced driving in new york
1729622 we have been concerned about an upward trend in some of the recent rate filings we have received that may not fully take into account the impact of high gas prices on new york drivers as governor paterson said these are difficult economic times for new yorkers and the insurance department is committed to doing all it can to ensure new york drivers receive the benefit of any reductions in auto insurance claims let me be clear there may be other factors involved and we recognize that auto insurance losses have been increasing recently we are not making a prejudgment but we do expect insurance companies to explain the rate impact of higher gas prices and the resulting dramatic reduction in driving we are seeing in the latest federal statistics we will take that into account as we evaluate rate increase requests
1729623 how are you measuring comparing those gains how can you be sure that they are not just mental

1729628 allora il signore dir anche a quelli della sua sinistra andate via da me maledetti nel fuoco eterno preparato per il diavolo e per i suoi angeli
1729629 dio infatti non risparmi gli angeli che avevano peccato ma li inabiss confinandoli in antri tenebrosi per esservi custoditi per il giudizio

1729640 at the g8 if the facts had been in front of the leaders prime minister harper would not have been able to make the statements that he made
1729641 when china sees a genuine commitment from the developed world to reduce developed world emissions and some sort of preparedness to help in technology transfer for the developing world then they will go further

1729670 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1729671 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1729672 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1729673 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way

1729678 i think i made too wide a circle and got in territory i didnt know
1729679 i sat between these two rocks and i looked up and there was a wolf looking at me i kind of swore at him and told him to get out of there and he run away he went

1729690 there was a tray of cakes left over from the buffet my friend put three cakes in his mouth so i tried four
1729691 they were small only an inch and a half across but i struggled with four my friend must have told adam what we were doing and he put five cakes in his mouth
1729692 i could see that he was struggling to eat them but then he walked across to the toilets i thought he was wanted to spit them out i didnt know he was choking at that point
1729693 i only realised how serious it was a minute or two later when other people ran to help him
1729694 i realised adam was in trouble as he walked towards the toilets his body was convulsing
1729695 there was cake around his mouth and i could hear and see that he was trying to cough i ran to the toilet and started slapping his back as hard as i could
1729696 then i tried the heimlich manoeuvre but he collapsed on the floor and i called for an ambulance
1729697 clearly any activity involving putting large amounts of food in the mouth is dangerous
1729698 the woman was very lucky she was not more seriously injured

1729731 were in an asset deflation of near historic proportions that calls for the use of the governments balance sheet and not for the federal reserve to raise interest rates
1729732 to the extent that the central banks now must prevent that deflation interest rates dont go up they go down

1729740 assuming universal remains in all its products it has to hold a minimum amount of capital to keep the regulators happy this generally amounts to about 200 to risk based capital rbc which for universal american works out to about 390 million of course its unlikely universal would allow its statutory capital to fall to the absolute minimum so at 300 of risk based capital or 583 million relative to the 950 million currently held at the subsidiary level this analysis suggests that universal has the opportunity to transfer approximately 360 million in excess cash from the subs to the parent company this would be additive to the 126 million that universal currently holds at the parent company
1729741 the idea of the caucus is to look at the refugee problem from a humanitarian perspective not to focus on why there are refugees but to look at solutions
1729742 the caucus is an attempt to conduct a dialogue with unrwa the un agency for palestine refugees and not an attempt to force a solution
1729743 unrwa is performing a humanitarian task that we support even if there are some differences of opinion
1729744 by far the most protracted and largest of all the refugee problems in the world today
1729745 the unhcrs mandate does not extend to the majority of palestinian refugees by virtue of paragraph 7 c of the organizations statute which excludes persons who continue to receive from other organs or agencies of the united nations protection or assistance
1729746 because refugees have to be physically present in unrwas area of operations to benefit from its assistance stateless palestinian refugees living beyond that area get no assistance from the agency unrwa
1729747 the refugee agency does not deal with palestinian refugees in israel and the surrounding states a task handled by the un relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east unrwa

1729768 the christian man finds in the bible the very word of god let it not be said that dependence on a book is a dead or an artificial thing the reformation of the sixteenth century was founded upon the authority of the bible yet it set the world aflame dependence upon a word of man would be slavish but dependence upon gods word is life dark and gloomy would be the world if we were left to our own devices and had no blessed word of god the bible to the christian is not a burdensome law but the very magna charta of christian liberty it is no wonder then that liberalism is totally different from christianity for the foundation is different christianity is founded upon the bible it bases upon the bible both its thinking and its life liberalism on the other hand is founded upon the shifting emotions of sinful men

1729788 i asked him for his autograph and he gave it to me he was very nice he was here for about 15 minutes he didnt want to stay very long he probably didnt want you guys the press to know about him

1729790 the trip was global education at its best our faculty and students personally experienced life business and education in china
1729791 we certainly got the red carpet and black limousine treatment in shanghai
1729792 this was a fantastic trip just to see our students gaining a new perspective of the world beyond the county line
1729793 they certainly made the most of this experience they now have friends halfway around the world and have developed a desire to learn more about china they have a new awareness and have developed a new appreciation for all things chinese
1729794 i am a history major and it is essential for us to know the culture of other countries that are far older than ours and not limit ourselves to the knowledge of just our own nation
1729795 i am amazed at their level of competence in communicating in english their desire to learn their seriousness and the amount of time they spend on their studies are enviable
1729796 it made me aware that china is going to play a leading role in the world economy and politics much sooner that i expected before
1729797 i realize that it is my duty to prepare my students for the strong competition that is coming i have always respected the ancient history and culture of china but now i respect their current efforts intelligence and sensitivity as well

1729813 i turned over the usb and they put me in isolation if i turn over more information they will reopen gorgona a small pacific island that colombia once used as an alcatraz style prison to stick me there it is very hard to tell the truth there are 9 000 files on the usb in which everything is spoken of and many important people appear
1729814 today we are like the ugly girlfriend at night they caress us and during the day they dont even look at us power is very good and politicians will do anything to have it
1729815 the information we had was that he had ties to the eln and that he was acting as an intermediary between kidnap victims relatives and the guerrillas and it was people from the high command of the army who gave us this information
1729816 i dont know why they havent tied him to any criminal investigation ill just give you one piece of information when i was the commander in urab and he was the commander of the 17th brigade i kidnapped two people who had been detained by the army held at the brigade headquarters i got them out of the brig with complicity i took them out in a car from the brigade itself in a covered red trooper they were from the farcs 5th front and they had kidnapped a woman in buenaventura i entered the brigade took the people out we took them to buenaventura and disappeared them gen rito alejo went to see carlos casta o many times and they met at ranches near the border of c rdoba and urab antioquia the security forces were very tied down when it came to fighting the guerrillas and we used the same methods the subversives did our results benefited the army there is more i patrolled with col byron carvajal recently convicted for planning the massacre of an elite police counter drug unit in jamund valle in 2006 in 1995 and we fought the guerrillas i went anywhere i wanted like pedro in his own house i entered brigades headquarters police barracks i did what i wanted
1729817 in urab when we began all the bodies were left where the people were killed but the security forces protested and asked us to keep working but to disappear the cadavers that is why mass graves were implemented the problem was that the mortality rates increased rapidly and this was not helpful i traveled freely in a white hilux pickup truck which they called road to heaven and we killed people every day in all the municipalities of urab the only one who denounced this was gloria cuartas at the time the outspoken mayor of apartad one of urab s main towns
1729818 the biggest victims will be the victims who are going to be left without the truth it is necessary to tell the truth about this war in which only the rich benefited and the poor lost

1729838 holidays play a huge role in our life and we spend much of the year saving planning and looking forward to going away we want our guests to keep their memories as long as possible
1729839 our research shows that experiential holidays that involve sightseeing tours theme parks or city breaks for example prove to be the most memorable no doubt because they stimulate the mind and the senses
1729840 we hope that our free brain training memory initiative albeit relaxed and fun will enhance our customers experience with us and lead to a longer lasting holiday memory
1729841 research has shown that each of these techniques can have a positive effect on memory and if they make a difference to our customers experiences then its a positive step for british holidaymakers
1729842 retaining our holiday memories for almost seven years may seem like a long time to some people but really we should be keeping hold of these special events for much much longer
1729843 in my own experience holidays that involve a journey through a new culture where i taste unusual food witness strange vistas meet different people always leave the longest lasting memories particularly when laced with the thrill of the unexpected
1729844 what is more people may not be aware that our holiday memories can also be used to help us recall information in day to day life
1729845 this campaign is a great way of reminding people that holiday memories should be cherished

1729907 the terrible news of the marti youngster has overshadowed the execution in texas last night of a mexican
1729908 there is no reason for outrage the man was a rapist
1729909 if we had the death penalty here there wouldnt be so many crimes
1729910 there are those who see this as an opportunity to call for a return to the death penalty
1729911 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country

1729925 organization and mobilization of crews were the biggest concerns moving a lot of men around to different sites by boat and working in rough remote locations in less than ideal weather conditions were all challenges
1729926 but the crews were up to the tasks and for some who were working on the submarine cables for the first time it was enjoyable work and a learning experience
1729927 once i heard of how rare an opportunity it was to see this caliber of work being performed i was thrilled that i was going to get the chance to see it first hand
1729928 such precise work skills were required and the line crews with the most experience were called to take part in the project and share some of their knowledge to the rest of the crew
1729929 the crew experienced some minor setbacks but quickly overcame them by working flawlessly as a team it was quite the experience and im glad i was given the opportunity to observe this project

1729934 execution by shooting wont kill the convicts instantly the law states that if the first shot on the heart doesnt work they must be shot again to the head
1729935 the executions are one problem and the decision of the constitutional court is another problem there is no relationship
1729936 it has nothing to do with the execution process the constitutional challenge they filed wont have any effect on the planned execution
1729937 it will only have an effect if the constitutional court issues a decision quickly in their favour

1729957 anytime you can get the government to jump onboard and help you with something as serious as a drinking water problem is definitely a plus
1729958 about a year and a half ago the water pipeline of a house next to the natural well busted
1729959 there was a dog staying in the area plus there were paint cans and oil cans and it contaminated the well so we were down to one well
1729960 there is a little bit of a sodium problem with the artesian well but not enough that its harmful to your health
1729961 and the more water that goes out of the well more water comes in and more sodium comes in thats been a concern so we went to the government and asked them to help us out with a microwater treatment plant
1729962 that road has been so bad over the past few years that weve had to spend money on a yearly basis to fill in potholes and it would only last a week or two it became quite an expense to the town
1729963 this funding on a 90 10 basis is a god send to us we applied for this funding back in 2006 and at that time we were informed we had to do it on a 50 50 basis
1729964 we get people walking around the pond and a concern has been that someone walking in the night could step in a pothole and twist their ankle
1729965 even while driving you never had to go very fast to hit a pothole and do serious damage to your car
1729966 i am very pleased that these important projects are being funded
1729967 this part of rural newfoundland and labrador is growing and investments such as these will ensure that residents and industry have access to infrastructure that will improve our quality of life and our ability to continue to grow
1729968 the communitys council invited john r courage the mha for fortune hermitage at the time to attend a council meeting back in 1958 to discuss the possibility of the community becoming incorporated as a town
1729969 mr courage recommended that the community council be dissolved and that the residents form a town council our first council was elected on aug 11 1958 with mr david king being elected as mayor mr king still holds the record for serving the most years as mayor seven as he held that post from 1958 to 1965
1729970 our fish plant of course was the major happening in the community since 1958 it employed so many people at the facility and in the offshore fishery since the fresh fish processing operation started in the early 1960s
1729971 in the mid 1960s our community thanks largely to the fish plant was designated as a growth centre for the resettlement program in that era of our provincial history our population took a giant step forward at that time
1729972 i honestly feel we have turned an economic corner in our history especially with such aquaculture companies as cooke aquaculture and northern harvest newfoundland division inc now in our area if we can get our plant into cooke aquaculture hands to get them into secondary processing well definitely be on an upswing in the future
1729973 we also anticipate that the aquaculture industry will create several spin off industries which will provide services needed by the aquaculture companies in addition we are always talking to new investors for the community we have already been talking to a number of manufacturing companies who may be coming to harbour breton or to the coast of bays
1729974 im honoured to be here on this historic occasion for harbour breton this community is going through a regeneration a rejuvenation period which is very positive
1729975 the town in my view has turned a corner and i think were going to have a very prosperous harbour breton and a strong region over the next number of years
1729976 on behalf of david denine the provincial minister of municipal affairs i want to congratulate the town on its 50th anniversary of incorporation
1729977 this is a very vibrant community and i believe the future will be good for harbour breton and the coast of bays
1729978 o f all republicans mr mccain should have the least to worry about being called a bush clone
1729979 did not call for his rumsfelds resignation he always said thats the presidents prerogative
1729980 said his comments were not a call for rumsfelds resignation

1729986 it continues to post strong usage growth 60 percent growth in our content verticals our third party business continued to show significant volume growth
1729987 we believe this performance is also due to the continuing affects of acquisition integration as previously discussed
1729988 weve made substantial progress since then particularly this month platform a is now fully integrated sales marketing engineering
1729989 we will assess all of the options one that ought to be thought about as a benchmark against any kind of strategic change would just be operating it as if the cash flow from that operation is superior to any deal we could get
1729990 we have not seen cannibalization so far i dont think its right to think that margins are lower theyre higher by rental obviously
1729991 it will take some time to fully resolve our challenges
1729992 our information at the moment would suggest that a person has doused our victim in petrol doused the house in petrol and then that petrol has been set on fire
1729993 the exact sequence of that has yet to be established our victim sustained quite horrific injuries and is also suffering from smoke inhalation
1729994 it will take some time to fully resolve our challenges
