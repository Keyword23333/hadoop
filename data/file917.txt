9170000 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9170001 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9170002 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9170003 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9170004 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9170005 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9170006 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9170007 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9170008 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9170009 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9170010 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9170011 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9170012 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings

9170020 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9170021 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9170022 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9170023 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9170024 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9170025 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9170026 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

9170034 para nosotros sigue siendo el mismo jugador importante pero tenemos que mirar las condiciones en las que llega el jugador se ha visto que en ltimas semanas la presi n de su entorno fue m s fuerte hubo declaraciones y el jugador no est en condiciones
9170035 en la ida en valencia nos dimos cuenta de que no pod amos ir a m s porque l est preocupado con presi n y la cabeza fuera nosotros quer amos ganar la supercopa era mejor no meterle y utilizar jugadores comprometidos con nosotros por eso fue el cambio y ahora no le llevamos hasta que no se resuelva el tema no podemos utilizarle

9170048 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9170049 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag

9170075 that could be the starting point of a new generation for the south african one day side thats how weve got to look at it and how im trying to package it
9170076 ive been very disappointed by how england have outplayed us in all three disciplines how we havent applied the basics enough
9170077 thats my major worry and that is up to us as a coaching staff to get right i see that as a major challenge for my management team now
9170078 if we can see this as a challenge and get the team moving to where we want it i am really looking forward to the next couple of months
9170079 it was a very very special test series victory for us
9170080 we ended that part of the tour and this part has been hugely disappointing
9170081 but this really is a time for us to start moving out of an era when we were very very good forward to the world cup in 2011
9170082 our attack is very inexperienced in terms of one day cricket and in some key batting areas weve got a lot of younger players
9170083 we need to get them out there and expose them if i have to take a positive out of this its asked us all where we want to go as a one day unit
9170084 guys need to focus on their positions in the one day team
9170085 i really think it is time for us to re evaluate where we want to go re evaluate our personnel and start a new era for south africa in terms of one day cricket and getting ready for the world cup in 2011

9170100 the bottom line is this case is not over this is step one
9170101 were i on the jury i would have completely discounted any reference to the dna evidence in this case it was so rifled with problems
9170102 had the jury looked closely at the evidence and studied it and carefully considered it i dont think they could have arrived at this verdict
9170103 to have worked those years dedicated to getting criminals off the streets and to be brutally murdered by someone who probably should have been in jail years ago it was senseless the system finally caught up and justice was done
9170104 this man will never again endanger anyone in the rest of his life

9170145 twitter could sell ads twitter is already doing this in japan advertising is the most viable option but the total potential pool is not huge social media sites are notorious for having low ad response rates and advertisers will enter a new forum cautiously

9170147 prime minister stephen harpers apparent plan to call a general election this coming week in defiance of the governments own legislation fixing october 2009 as the date of the next federal election has triggered a good deal of controversy this past week
9170148 a number of commentators have argued that calling an election without waiting for the house of commons to reconvene on sept 15 would violate established constitutional conventions or norms
9170149 some have even claimed that the election call would be illegal in light of the governments fixed election date legislation and suggested that the governor general michaelle jean should carefully consider whether she should accept the prime ministers request
9170150 in fact while the prime ministers election gambit may violate political commitments it is perfectly consistent with constitutional norms and practices and would not violate the fixed date election legislation
9170151 the first point to recognize is that under westminster style parliamentary systems such as our own a prime minister has virtually absolute discretion to determine the date of a general election
9170152 while the formal legal power to trigger an election rests in the hands of the governor general there is a firm constitutional requirement that she will exercise her powers only on the advice of the prime minister
9170153 thus when the prime minister asks the governor general to dissolve parliament and fix the date of the election the governor general is expected to automatically grant the request without making an independent assessment of its merits
9170154 it has been suggested that there may be exceptional circumstances in which a governor general might be justified in exercising a
9170155 there is no basis for the governor general refusing to follow his advice
9170156 dont cry were only 13 were too young to have any problems
9170157 but i have to peter i have to grow up
9170158 peter theres no other way of saying this but im pregnant
9170159 so when you was flying out what was you happy thought
9170160 and when you was flying back in what was your happy thought then
9170161 i was hoping i could pretend the baby was yours
9170162 you know if its a boy we could name him adam or zachariah or
9170163 if not her first name it could be her middle name but dont set you heart on a girl we have equal chance having a boy
9170164 wed have to live in london get a job wed have to make sacrifices peter
9170165 i know wendy i know life will be hard but id do anything for a girl anything
9170166 well lets just let tinkerbelle be our last happy thought
9170167 the connection with previous clubs that we played for will always be made every time we come up against each other
9170168 roys probably spent as much money as i have during this window so hes not afraid to make changes to his playing squad if he sees fit
9170169 theyve had a good start so itll be a difficult game for us
9170170 at the stadium of light they have a great passionate support as we do here
9170171 so its never easy going there and roy has instilled a good work ethic into them that well have to overcome and match
9170172 it can be difficult playing thursday and then having to prepare for an away game in the premier league on the following sunday
9170173 were mindful of that but ive had experience of that as well so we know the recovery protocols that we put in place to make sure that the players are fit and well going into the game
9170174 we face another difficult tie in fairness omonia knocked out aek athens in the last round
9170175 it shows there are no easy games in europe these days so well have to be on our mettle
9170176 at the stadium of light they have a great passionate support as we do here
9170177 if the law is passed by september 9 or 10 we can hold the elections on december 22 if its later than that we will try for december 31
9170178 it was a bomb placed close to an apple vendor in pettah
9170179 this was definitely the ltte they are desperate and taking civilian targets since they are being defeated on the northern battlefront
9170180 its like everybody i think david moyes evertons manager is just looking as we are for loans
9170181 theres a shortage of money out there in the world at the moment it seems
9170182 although sunderland have signed a few players most clubs have not really been spending like they used to and i think they will be spending less and less
9170183 i can see it getting tighter wages have gone up expenses are higher lots of people involved in businesses are struggling
9170184 and clubs are selling players who not long ago you wouldnt expect them to sell
9170185 they are players you thought they wanted to keep so that they could push on and push on and build
9170186 suddenly it has gone the opposite way and one or two other clubs have come in and taken the opportunity to strengthen
9170187 for me as i keep saying it will be the toughest premier league ever look at the other sides
9170188 sunderland are a possible top 10 team this season stoke have just come up but they will be strong they showed that in beating villa
9170189 but certain clubs will still spend certain owners have mega money
9170190 our owner has been fantastic and given us great backing but he knows hes got to balance the books
9170191 if you buy people youve got to sell others to pay for them thats how it should be really
9170192 at pompey i suppose that in the long term weve also got to finance a new training ground and in time a new stadium as well
9170193 we only hold 20 000 people now weve got to be sensible but we pay good wages here and and if i can get a couple more loans in before the deadline i will
9170194 it would be nice to get a point nice to get three points but its a long season and even tottenham will probably still have no points after going to chelsea on sunday and they wont go down either
9170195 crouch and defoe will get goals no worry but there will be some games we will have to play 4 5 1 away which worked well for us last season
9170196 but how can i buy two international strikers and then drop defoe in the first game at chelsea you can imagine what would be said
9170197 the whole obama narrative is built around the narrative that obama and campaign strategist david axelrod built and like all stories its not entirely true
9170198 his constituents the media and his political opponents to fully examine him
9170199 pattern of rarely volunteering information or documents even when relatively innocuous
9170200 as the president of the law review obama didnt write articles he edited and reviewed them
9170201 we have released documents that reflect every one of the final terms of the senators purchase of the home
9170202 its either a grand slam home run or itll turn out to be a bust
9170203 as governor ive stood up to the old politics as usual to the special interests to the lobbyists the big oil companies and the good old boy network
9170204 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics
9170205 before you speak persian know that in sparta everyone even a kings messenger are held accountable for the words of his voice now what message do you bring
9170206 you you rode all the way from persia for earth and water
9170207 do not be coy or stupid persian you can afford neither in sparta you must go to tescos or walmart to buy such things
9170208 no man persian or greek no man threatens a messenger
9170209 you bring the crowns and heads of conquered kings to my citys steps you insult my queen you threaten my people with slavery and death oh ive chosen my words carefully persian perhaps you should have done the same
9170210 in the long term its going to generate a lot more money for the county than its ever going to cost
9170211 often times in order to seek political support you go out and fudge on the front side of it
9170212 you cant verify that a forecast was accurate unless you build the project
9170213 if they build it and the purpose of misrepresenting the costs was to get it built what do they care if 20 years later someone shows that the forecast was incorrect
9170214 i had a chance to go to a club down south but preston appealed to me much more on a massive scale
9170215 everything is geared up for a premiership football club here preston have got off to a fantastic start this season and hopefully that can carry on
9170216 i concentrated on winning and as im starting to get a cold i was not able to think about a faster time
9170217 i had a chance to go to a club down south but preston appealed to me much more on a massive scale
9170218 everything is geared up for a premiership football club here preston have got off to a fantastic start this season and hopefully that can carry on
9170219 based on the initial findings of the house committee on agriculture chaired by palawan congressman baham mitra which is conducting regional consultations nationwide one of the biggest problems confronting our farmers is the high cost of fertilizers and other farm inputs aside from the severe shortage in post harvest facilities
9170220 indeed this is a huge increase in funding for our agriculture sector but the lifting of the evat on farm inputs might be a more direct approach to help our farmers since we have already given up any prospect of having a balanced budget for 2009 we might as well absorb some damage in terms of evat revenues and go all out to help our farmers
9170221 apart from education we have to invest on our agriculture sector to achieve food security agriculture is one sector that the philippines have so much potential we may not be able to produce our own fuel but as long as we have enough food to feed our people we can survive the economic challenges that confront even the worlds leading economies
9170222 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especially at the ramadan time

9170271 i work on the principle that its not possible to take anyones views on music seriously if they dont like the beatles everything else is a question of personal taste and therefore debatable but if you dont recognise the beatles as the twentieth centurys most inventive most influential and most talented composers youre pretty much admitting that youve rather missed the point of the last hundred years of musical endeavour should you fall into that category i do not condemn neither do i mock i merely despair and having despaired i move on

9170304 on top of that we are obviously paying careful attention to reliability and the way the car behaves over the monza kerbs an aspect of the package that saw us in difficulty last year i think we are working well even if we will only have the first real confirmation of this after qualifying for the italian grand prix

9170318 i would say we have done a good job even if it is too early to say what the situation will be here during the race weekend it was a pleasure to meet with president montezemolo who visited the track today now we have to try and do everything as well as possible to get back to winning again starting with the race in spa the world championship i will give it my best shot and then we can count the points at the end

9170354 the truth of the matter is i know were playing this week but my heart is not beating faster
9170355 its just beating normal because the game hasnt been on my mind every minute of the day
9170356 ive always been a worrier as a player i wouldnt eat before a game because i was so worried i couldnt swallow as a coach i was a worrier and as an athletic director i was a worrier
9170357 but now im not worried about anything tonights game marks the first time in 50 years arkansas has opened a football season without broyles holding the titles of head coach or athletic director
9170358 i cant explain it except to tell you that in the years past i would be uptight with the season starting but im not uptight now
9170359 im not in charge and dont have the responsibility and pressure weighing on me of balancing the budget
9170360 i didnt realize what a big difference it would make how much less stress id be feeling
9170361 i dont know if people are just being kind but nearly everyone i talk with says gee retirement really makes you look a lot younger
9170362 i can remember the days when id walk out in the hall and see him and id dart and go a different direction
9170363 as a coach or an athletic director youre overseeing everything and there are so many ups and downs
9170364 people may not realize how much he lived and died on every play
9170365 now coach broyles is going to enjoy razorback football more than ever because hes not directly involved razorback foundation president chuck dicus who played for broyles said hes not surprised by the seemingly easy transition hes made since retiring as athletic director on jan 1
9170366 hes been an inspiration to so many people myself included so im not surprised hes adjusted so well
9170367 having him around its a real positive for us because theres such a wealth of knowledge there that we can tap into
9170368 there are always people who want to see him old friends or people who just want to meet him for the first time
9170369 coach broyles is still in the limelight because of the 50 years hes given to arkansas and how far hes brought this university athletically
9170370 jeff is going with his style of leadership what hes seen work at other institutions where hes worked
9170371 i think hes doing it his way and thats what he has to do among longs biggest challenges at arkansas has been overseeing the merging of the mens and womens athletic departments
9170372 hes got a tougher job than i had in that respect
9170373 but i think its working out well broyles said he met with long a few days ago to discuss something but that he has tried not to crowd the new athletic director and has offered advice only when its sought
9170374 he has not tried to second guess me or impose his will on me in any way
9170375 i respect that and it tells me even more how great a person frank broyles is i enjoy him i appreciate him and im very fortunate to be following him
9170376 hes been great whenever ive had a question just recently he gave me some advice that i think was right on the mark broyles has a seven year 2 million contract with the ua to continue working as a consultant and be paid by the razorback foundation until he is 90
9170377 i dont now if hell go beyond 90 but hes not going to slow down before then broyles said hes excited about attending games this season and not feeling stressed out
9170378 im going to be a fan and cheer and yell and if we lose im not going to die
9170379 then ill get excited for the next game broyles plans to attend one road game this season when arkansas plays former southwest conference rival texas at austin on sept 13
9170380 i thought it was nuts the first time i heard he was going to do it
9170381 he was my biggest concern coming out of the spring
9170382 a lot of times as a senior sometimes you feel you know it all and youve done it all
9170383 he said if you want to play for me you have to study
9170384 he has really had a good summer and has worked extremely hard to develop himself as a player
9170385 hes taken the attitude of what else can i learn and how can i come out and practice better
9170386 he teaches a different philosophy and it gets us there faster and easier
9170387 you throw your hands back and you shoot them you can blow the guy right off the ball instead of just trying to reach them and put your hands on them
9170388 we watch falcon film to get a glimpse of what our offense can look like
9170389 by the time you get to be a senior you would be like to be on the football field performing
9170390 its a mixture of two back one back multiple offense
9170391 i dont know exactly how to define it but its definitely not the spread arkansas players struggled to put a name to the new attack
9170392 ill have to get back to you on that one
9170393 i come from greenwood where we throw the rock like its nothing but here its i dont know theres always someone open the petrinos have minced no words in defining their expectations for the offense
9170394 we want to execute control the line of scrimmage and be able to both run and throw the ball down the field
9170395 id love to see casey make good decisions and distribute and understand what the coverage tells him to do and take advantage of it gaining field position and first downs simply wont be enough
9170396 the goal is to score every time we get the football and every time we dont its a disappointment
9170397 we expect to go out there and move the ball up and down the field and score touchdowns
9170398 were never going to be happy with anything less than that
9170399 with a new staff the bottom line is we dont know for sure how theyre going to line up on defense offense or in the kicking game
9170400 theres no question that its a very unsettling factor for the coaching staff when you simply cant study game tape to prepare for a team
9170401 weve watched their spring game and tried to learn from that
9170402 youve got to go recognize where people are at their formations and what they like to do in certain situations
9170403 when you watch him on film this one personnel group we saw you would draft that kid off that one clip
9170404 youve got to wrap up and gang tackle on him every starter in the hogs back seven on defense is new but that doesnt seem to be a great concern at least publicly for some players
9170405 everybody from the seniors to the sophomores even the freshmen can come out here and perform willy robinson was asked this week if he had enough playmakers on defense
9170406 we do have playmakers and it is the inexperience that were going to have to suffer through
9170407 today a maverick has chosen another maverick senator john mccain made a phenomenal choice to join his ticket in alaska governor sarah palin a fiscal conservative with a record of cutting wasteful spending and fighting for the development of new energy resources including drilling governor palin envisions exactly what our country needs to move forward as the commander of the alaska national guard and a mother of a soldier deploying to iraq in september governor palin has what it takes to lead our country in a time of war she is the mother of five solidly pro life and pro traditional family a hunter and fisher with a record of challenging the status quo as a republican woman i take immense pride in the fact that once again our party has demonstrated that is truly the party of change and the party of ideas it is an exciting day for our country
9170408 sarah palin is a pleasant surprise for those of us who had hoped that senator mccain would pick a principled and authentic conservative pro life leader sarah palin is both principled and authentic as a governor she also brings an important balance of understanding of the critical domestic issues that is needed and that the democrats have ignored with their ticket governor palin is smart authentic tough and a dynamic choice that will remind women that they are not welcome on the democrats ticket they have a place with republicans
9170409 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government governor palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington i applaud senator mccain for selecting governor palin this decision is yet another example of why the american people can trust him to make wise decisions and to confidently lead this country
9170410 sen mccains selection of alaska gov sarah palin is an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base of his party she is a strong executive who hates corruption and puts principle above politics gov palins commitment to the sanctity of life is not just a political position she was advised to abort her fifth and youngest child when it was learned he had down syndrome she refused thats bravery and integrity in action gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected and that gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court and the way he would conduct our nations domestic and international affairs
9170411 one of the four players could be a cricketer from overseas who has played at least 10 tests and or 20 odis

9170415 there is an ever increasing demand for indian basmati rice known for superior quality
9170416 in terms of quality indian basmati is matchless our quality monitoring and delivery mechanism are good giving us an edge in the world market
9170417 almost 90 per cent racs are honoured as of now we do not see any reason for a slowdown in the export of basmati rice
9170418 efforts are on to enter the market of china and mexico as well
9170419 the one thing that sarah brings is that her husband worked on the north slope its very much a working family her father was a school teacher so she doesnt come from money shes a mother of five and she definitely can relate to the average individual and i think especially in missouri she can
9170420 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9170421 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9170422 in 2006 after the winter season i was hoping that i would have had a shot in 2007 but i ended up having tommy john and went through a bunch of obstacles and different injuries that i had to overcome and now finally im here and im part of a team thats got a lot of good things going for them right now
9170423 you get a lot of comments like how long are you going to last are you going to last a week three weeks a month but the comments dont really bother me everything tends to go that way im always getting hurt its just frustrating that its always one thing or another
9170424 i think im going to go with the same game plan just a little bit different
9170425 there are smarter hitters up there more patient hitters and youve got to adjust to the hitters you cant just go out there and do the same thing but im going to keep playing my game im going to throw to my strengths
9170426 youre going to see a guy who goes out there and competes and gives it all hes got
9170427 im going to go after hitters im not going to shy away from them im going to go right after them and give it everything ive got
9170428 ive got good command of all three pitches ill pretty much throw all three in any count

9170566 el avi n estuvo un total de 33 minutos en plataforma por lo que no se justificaba un cambio de avi n que habr a implicado un retraso superior a los 60 minutos para el desembarque de pasajeros equipaje y carga a rea y su posterior embarque en un nuevo aparato o incluso superior en el caso de que se perdieran los derechos de despegue

9170599 per non smarrire londa mediatica che immagina essere lunico canale per essere in sintonia con il paese reale condividendo cos lagenda del governo e lofferta di un immaginario dialogo istituzionale
9170600 un problema tra prodi e berlusconi ma di delicato equilibrio tra la riservatezza personale e lesigenze delle indagini trovare questo equilibrio spetta al legislatore il governo con lo stesso tempismo dimostrato per il lodo alfano porti in aula alla camera una proposta precisa e si confronti con lopposizione
9170601 interrogarsi anzitutto sul funzionamento di un sistema giudiziario in cui i magistrati sono molto impegnati da vicende del secolo scorso
9170602 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni segrete diventata una patologia italiana un virus che come quello di un computer annebbia lo schermo e ingarbuglia sino a renderlo incomprensibile il discorso della politica nazionale il problema in questo caso non leventuale responsabilit di un ex presidente del consiglio forse la stoccata di romano un po troppo sensibile agli affetti familiari sar accertata se mai dalla magistratura il problema continua leditorialista del corriere se sia giusto tollerare che uno strumento dindagine destinato a favorire la ricerca della verit venga usato per seminare dubbi alimentare chiacchiere e attizzare polemiche
9170603 con una legge che in linea di principio non difficile immaginare e scrivere ma tutto diventa terribilmente complicato se la classe politica preferisce servirsi di questi incidenti soprattutto per colpire lavversario o speculare sulle sue intenzioni la responsabilit in questo caso sottolinea romano mi sembra essere soprattutto dellopposizione anzich dirsi pronta a discutere con la maggioranza il tenore della legge la sinistra ha preferito sospettare in questa fuga unoperazione diretta a favorire i disegni del governo
9170604 lopposizione trover altri temi su cui dissentire dal governo e fare le proprie battaglie sul problema delle intercettazioni ha il dovere di lavorare in parlamento per una legge che spenga le luci accese su questo brutto reality show
9170605 lopposizione tende a vedere nella vicenda soltanto un tranello ordito dal presidente del consiglio lobiettivo berlusconiano sarebbe quello di piegare le resistenze dellopposizione contro la legge che la tesi sia fondata o no conta relativamente pesa di pi la risposta scelta in modo piuttosto compatto dal pd in piena sintonia con lalleato antonio di pietro e favorita dal rifiuto prodiano alla proposta del cavaliere di approvare subito il provvedimento
9170606 le premesse di uno scontro che scomunica qualunque confronto con la maggioranza di governo e pu risucchiare il centrosinistra in un bunker antiberlusconiano rassicurante ma anche senza via duscita la difesa dei giudici contro quelli che vengono visti solo come progetti di normalizzazione finisce per apparire un obiettivo limitato quasi di ripiego soprattutto nel momento in cui vicende come alitalia mostrano la capacit del governo di calamitare pezzi importanti del mondo imprenditoriale
9170607 il pd segnala il notista politico del corriere sembra irretito da un centrodestra capace di decisioni magari controverse sul piano economico ma paganti su quello politico e del consenso
9170608 tende a ripiegarsi su se stesso coltivando i pregiudizi pi logori contro il premier il risultato di aggravare la subalternit non solo al berlusconismo ma ad un di pietro che incalza e alza la posta una deriva culturale destinata a trascinare lopposizione conclude apocalitticamente franco su terreni sempre pi impervi e minoritari e foriera di ulteriori ritardi e di nuove delusioni
9170609 ha dato prova della sua indiscutibile statura etica a dire di pubblicare le sue intercettazioni ma il problema rimane non pu essere lui o un altro a decidere

9170641 i am very grateful for everything palace did for me but thats in the past now but im just looking ahead to the future and well see what happens
9170642 it was really good to get a win at the end
9170643 we were on top from the very start we just could not put our chances away i was so relieved to come out on top
9170644 it was quite a physical game we are used to just passing the ball around but when sides play england they are going to try their hardest to try and get at us get tight to us and stop us from playing
9170645 what is my relationship with benitez i dont think in the scheme of things that is wildly important
9170646 he has got his own things to concern himself with he has got his own team and ive got my side here
9170647 im not every single day phoning up managers to ask how they are nor do i expect them to call me i dont get general chats with managers
9170648 will i shake hands with benitez i am sure that will not be a problem
9170649 i havent won i dont feel that at all i swear to you
9170650 i am so relieved he is still here when i was not expecting him to be here but this is not a triumphalist shout far from it

9170655 i do not want to say too much i do not want to analyse too much what has gone on before because we cannot change things now
9170656 i am now only concerned with how to beat villa and how to control barry on the pitch
9170657 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that
9170658 i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer i was surprised at what has been said but i insist i have not spoken to him since april
9170659 i do not believe there will be any problem shaking hands we can do it
9170660 we know that barry is a good player very good for them we will try to contain him on the pitch
9170661 president mikheil saakashvili of georgia has acted stupidly to put it mildly but we must also take into account how massive the russian provocations were

9170685 we now spend similar amounts to europe on health generally and cancer care in particular but less than two thirds of the european average on cancer drugs it just cant be that everybody else around the world is wrong about access to innovative cancer care and the nhs right in rationing it so severely
9170686 the time has come for a radical change in how the nhs makes rationing decisions for cancer
9170687 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs which is determined annually by parliament if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis

9170715 arabs should not consider their visit to jerusalem or to any area in palestine as a form of normalization with the israeli enemy
9170716 the truth is totally the opposite in fact we in palestine feel that any attempt or plan to visit us is a form of support to our cause the cultural events marking occupied jerusalem as the capital of culture will be successful when celebrated with our arab brothers
9170717 the celebration of jerusalem as the arab cultural capital is special because it is the first time that a city under occupation has such an honor the israelis have long tried to conceal and erase the features of the arab identity in jerusalem and the cultural celebrations will focus on the israeli plans and threats
9170718 i urge arab intellectuals to genuinely support the palestinians and use the cultural celebrations to produce common work i have always dreamt of pan arab cultural activities and we should all use jerusalem and palestine as gateways towards robust arab cohesion
9170719 even if we do not agree with the current political tendencies we must not distance ourselves from jerusalem and its cultural mission political issues emerge and disappear but the palestinian culture should remain

9170742 im quite surprised i was tired heading into the weekend but my driving was good and i missed the fairway only once today i was driving it really well and my iron play was spot on and most of my putts today were within five feet so it was a good day
9170743 i am playing to win i am gunning for a second title this year and i feel great i know i am playing with some of the top players but if i follow my rhythm i should be able to repeat my run on sunday
9170744 its my fourth straight round without dropping a shot and ive managed to continue my streak from last week i saw the leaderboard on the 15th hole and noticed i was one stroke back i knew i was playing with some really steady players so i wasnt that surprised i shot a birdie on the 17th hole and it kept me in a good position heading into the final round
9170745 i want to keep it going and dont want to force anything to happen if i can finish one stroke better than the rest of the field after 18 holes tomorrow it would be nice i cant explain why my form always rises after the second half of the season but im happy with it
9170746 im disappointed with my putting i could have gone 14 under today i couldnt have hit it any better out there and i just needed to putt well so it was quite frustrating im still very much in contention so im pleased

9170753 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9170754 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9170755 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9170756 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9170757 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9170758 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9170759 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9170760 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9170761 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9170762 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9170763 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9170764 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9170765 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9170766 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9170767 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9170768 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9170769 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9170770 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9170771 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9170772 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9170773 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9170774 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9170775 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9170797 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9170798 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9170799 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9170801 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9170802 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9170803 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9170804 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono

9170825 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9170826 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9170827 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9170828 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9170829 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9170830 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

9170844 drivers across the country can fight rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation tires that are underinflated by just six to seven psi can reduce vehicle fuel economy by as much as 2 percent and tire tread wear can also be reduced by as much as ten percent
9170845 tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas are wasted annually by u s drivers simply because theyre driving on underinflated tires
9170846 in addition that same 2 8 billion gallons wasted result into 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide released into the environment
9170847 we can all help prevent this by making sure our tires are properly inflated
9170848 people can find the tires proper inflation level on the vehicle placard located in the driver side door jamb in the glove box or in the owners manual

9170957 thus mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we are talking about nor whether what we are saying is true
9170958 what is wanted is not the will to believe but the will to find out which is the exact opposite
9170959 mathematics rightly viewed possesses not only truth but supreme beauty a beauty cold and austere like that of a sculpture without appeal to any part of our weaker nature without the gorgeous trapping of painting or music yet sublimely pure and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show the true spirit of delight the exaltation the sense of being more than man which is the touchstone of the highest excellence is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry
9170960 the fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence that it is not utterly absurd indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind a widespread belief is more often likely to be foolish than sensible
9170961 the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves but wiser people so full of doubts
9170962 it has been said that man is a rational animal all my life i have been searching for evidence which could support this

9170964 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9170965 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
9170966 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9170967 barack obama took sky high expectations and brought them down to ground level with a tremendous political speech that tried to connect with the concerns of average american voters
9170968 he managed to mix boiler plate policy proposals with american stories and values into a road map for the fall campaign it will take a few days before we know whether voters think obama hit a home run here in denver tonight but by any measure it was a big success
9170969 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
9170970 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own

9170973 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9170974 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9170975 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
9170976 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9170977 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
9170978 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9170979 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden

9170989 it is a short step from the sports stadium to the church or temple insofar as sports involve ritual and contemplation we watch games with intense absorption
9170990 in some societies the line was erased between sport and religion as a priest might preside at the games like religion sports are separated from ordinary work both in time and place and we build our arenas and gymnasiums not just for practical purposes but also to keep sports separate from daily life
9170991 john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes
9170992 sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington
9170993 her dedication to principle her courage both before and after her election as governor of alaska and her personal qualities make her a perfect choice for vice president
9170994 i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket

9171013 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
9171014 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 and it will not work in 2008
9171015 the selection of governor palin is an insult to women she has obviously been chosen to appeal to female voters but she lacks both the experience and policy positions to serve as vice president of the united states
9171016 the announcement of governor palins selection on john mccains 72nd birthday highlights the fact t hat the vice president must be qualified to step into the presidency from day one sarah palin is a 2 year governor with zero foreign policy experience whose former position was mayor of a town of 9 000
9171017 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgement it shows political panic
9171018 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9171019 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9171020 the mission is clear the next 67 days im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all

9171030 bollywood cinema is indias foremost artistic export so the narrowness of these audiences is striking its hard to imagine a bolshoi world tour playing to 90 per cent russian migr s or the berlin philharmonic appealing exclusively to german expats
9171031 if anything was going to raise international awareness of bollywoods unique brand of magic this unforgettable tour should have been it
9171032 we dont look into that aspect we are contracted to go and perform the pricing and the ticketing and the sales are sic all done by promoters
9171033 the lights are so bright we never get to see whos sitting in the audience and who they are
9171034 it was more us wanting to meet our audiences just an opportunity for us to come and meet the fans and to give them the opportunity to see us live
9171035 and thou art as an enchanted ape under gods sky where thou mightest have been a man had proper schoolmasters and conquerors and constables with cat onine tails been vouchsafed thee dost thou call that liberty
9171036 all the time we put into recording traveling and everything else is done so that we can get up in front of an audience and let something happen thats bigger than us thats the beauty of music its a force with a mind all its own
9171037 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time
9171038 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9171039 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9171040 an admirable person and she will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9171041 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9171042 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9171043 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
9171044 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9171045 weve also said though that in the face of inflationary pressures coming from the doubling of the price of oil rising food prices which is pushing inflation up in every country in the world now that weve got to make sure that inflation doesnt take hold here in this country
9171046 our economy along with every other economy in the world is going to be slowing this year it will be difficult it will be tough
9171047 we are feeling the effects of the problems that started in the financial markets and have spread to the wider economy
9171048 we have got to show as weve done in the past that we can come through this difficult economic times make sure that people feel safer in their jobs and their mortgages and make sure also that people know that the economic plan that we have for the future is taking us out of the downturn and preparing for the upturn
9171049 now in britain we are saying as you know that inflation is low interest rates are low and we expect there to be growth
9171050 its all the more remarkable that inflation generally is low when you have as everybody acknowledges rising food prices round the world and rising oil and commodity prices
9171051 despite this international uncertainty which started from the problems in the us housing market there are grounds for believing that we will get through this
9171052 we have a strong economy its momentum will carry us through
9171053 i think the choice is becoming pretty clear between a government that is determined at all times to maintain the stability and growth of the british economy
9171054 the world is watching and they are waiting for us and they are waiting to see what were made of

9171074 the lessons of history show that economic social and cultural rights cannot be relegated to the sidelines because they are essential conditions for the full enjoyment of civil and political rights the ideals of freedom can only be made meaningful if the individual enjoys a certain degree of material security

9171108 selections went ahead for this years elections in may following a compromise that meant sitting councillors would not have to be de selected but it is clear that for the elections in 2012 there are those in the party who are determined to go further
9171109 in a two member ward where both sitting labour councillors are male there is no doubt from what has been said that the intention would be that one would have to stand down in favour of a woman candidate their target of 50 female representation could not be achieved otherwise
9171110 there will be uproar in the party if they go ahead with this
9171111 if male labour councillors are de selected in these circumstances it is very likely they will stand as independents and get elected there will be mini blaenau gwents all across wales how does that advance the cause of gender equality

9171121 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9171122 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match
9171123 obviously a terrific story personal story im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket

9171223 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9171224 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
9171225 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
9171226 yes theres a segment of hillary clinton supporters who are probably disappointed she was not asked to be on that ticket
9171227 im very excited weve chosen a mom on the ticket who shares my conservative family values im very energized by our ticket
9171228 im solidly behind sarah palin she is someone ive been advocating for weeks
9171229 shes a strong conservative she believes in drilling and exploiting the natural resources in our own nation shes pro second amendment shes pro life and she fits the conservative agenda to a t
9171230 i think shes a great pick i think senator mccain has a reputation of being sort of a maverick in the u s senate and i think this lady is very reform oriented she has cut spending in alaska she has done some good stuff she brings a new dimension to the ticket being a woman with five children
9171231 as a republican im thrilled as a woman im thrilled as a conservative im thrilled i think he has flipped change on its head foreign policy isnt where he falls short sarah palin brings the executive experience if having a 5 month old baby is an issue then that would have been an issue in her home state where she was governor
9171232 i think it was a great selection shes got great executive experience shes worked her way up and shes got a great family background shes got a son in iraq and a 5 month old infant with down syndrome this gives her a unique perspective because shes got a number of children in a variety of situations i think she brings a lot to the table with a great perspective on a variety of issues
9171233 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
9171234 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

9171316 in confronting the danish cartoons and the dutch film fitna we sent a clear message to the west regarding the red lines that should not be crossed as we speak the official west and its public opinion are all now well aware of the sensitivities of these issues they have also started to look seriously into the question of freedom of expression from the perspective of its inherent responsibility which should not be overlooked

9171318 we know that parents have a tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat

9171321 no quiero matarme a mi masma podr a haber seguido con esta enfermedad durante los pr ximos 15 a os

9171335 yo ya ten a un proyecto de vida para los pr ximos 50 a os
9171336 we started the game off extremely well and kept going to the end in good fashion
9171337 i was a little surprised that wellington didnt come out fighting after their last result loss to melbourne
9171338 he was a bit slow in the first half he had to get that first goal to get the monkey off his back
9171339 weve got to be better than that there were opportunities for players there tonight and quite frankly they didnt take them
9171340 ich h rte viele sch sse fast eine ganze minute lang ganz nah an meinem haus
9171341 if the law is passed by september 9 or 10 we can hold the elections on december 22 if its later than that we will try for december 31

9171346 mego will never be booed he saved us from relegation to the third tier and quickly got us into the prem he is a legend in our eyes
9171347 i feel it is almost comical the hysteria that surrounds two games
9171348 it doesnt matter what sort of reaction i get from the west brom supporters my impression of them will never change
9171349 everton v portsmouth should be exciting with moyes finally making some signings everton should be on the up and arrys boys will be a lot better than their current last position attests in all reality with spurs usual stuttering start these two could battle for fifth
9171350 when it is announced fans of a series from the past will be surprised
9171351 la compa a tuvo la oportunidad de presentar a sus empleados una propuesta que los recompensara por su arduo trabajo y ofrecer un contrato de alto nivel en la industria as como una verdadera seguridad laboral fracas en todo sentido
9171352 no estamos hablando de los 27 000 miembros estamos hablando de los 27 000 miembros y de sus familias
9171353 un pa s con un poco de respeto por s mismo estar a vigilante y se asegurar a de no tomar parte en este criminal salvajismo
9171354 debido a una relaci n especial gran breta a tiene responsabilidad particularmente fuerte para detener estos delitos vergonzosos de cualquier manera posible
9171355 definitivamente no se han escuchado m s que d biles manifestaciones de protesta dif cilmente necesit bamos evidencias hab a m s que suficiente para saber que gitmo la base de guant namo iba a ser una c mara de tortura de otra forma por qu no llevar a los llamados combatientes enemigos a una prisi n en nueva york
9171356 siempre hablan de la tierra de las libertades pero cuando se trata de escoger entre libertad y autoridad ellos prefieren a la autoridad
9171357 n s entendemos que cada vida inocente tem um potencial incr vel
9171358 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought he said
9171359 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labor party has had in a generation quite frankly
9171360 weve got to rediscover the zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9171361 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9171362 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9171363 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9171364 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9171365 its not going to change its not a family show
9171366 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
9171367 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
9171368 one is a former doctor who wears a turban and another was a lawyer who is i dont know just lost
9171369 and this stuff about being inexperienced they cant knock sarah that way not from the obama campaign
9171370 if she does get in there im sure shes going to be pushing for a lot of issues that are really important for us alaskans
9171371 i like her but she doesnt have the experience to be on the national level
9171372 mccain is 72 years old with a history of cancer you know if she had to step in as president what about foreign affairs shes just not ready
9171373 i was really shocked i thought it would be someone like mitt romney
9171374 hes taking a big chance putting her on the ticket i dont think she has the depth
9171375 i dont think hard core democrats are going to go for that
9171376 the energy is high just because people are pleased with the attention it brings to alaska especially rural alaska
9171377 ive always been a fan of hers her speech this morning was out of this world shes so eloquent
9171378 it will be good for alaska because people always have this mentality that alaska is not part of the united states
9171379 i would have liked to see an obama palin ticket
9171380 shes a tremendous governor i would hate to lose her as governor
9171381 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride

9171384 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9171385 we hope to make torchwood a gripping and surprising tv event with storylines that push our team into greater danger and sacrifice joining our main cast are some fantastic guest artists who will only add to making this unmissable tv
9171386 i learned so much about the 7pm slot from russell t davies doctor who scripts and from his approach as an executive producer to that particular slot
9171387 russells been a huge supporter of merlin he immediately saw its potential and proved invaluable in early discussions about how to shape the series for saturday night
9171388 camelot is a land where magic is banned and merlin is a young boy who works as arthurs manservant and has to hide his abilities
9171389 the last time i was here i was performing at the grand which is always fantastic and i actually performed as the invisible man
9171390 i really love coming to the old place because the people are fantastic and they are always so enthusiastic theres been a doctor who museum here for years and the love for the show around here is amazing
9171391 she is shooting now we are not giving out any specifics on her character
9171392 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball southside
9171393 the boy was just desperate to get an autograph there were loads of paparazzi around brad and he was trying to get through when he tripped and almost fell brad put his reflexes to good use and grabbed him at the last minute
9171394 legend has it that shani dev who visited gokul dham on learning about lord krishnas birth was denied to have a glimpse of the newborn by his mother yashodha but later when krishna became a young man he personally arrived at this place to give shani dev a personal audience with him
9171395 visualise the situation if even one vehicle develops technical fault in the middle of the road there would be many kilometers long traffic snarl for hours making life difficult for thousands of people arriving here from far off distances at night the trek leading to the temple from highway is impossible during rainy days do you think it would motivate anyone for a revisit
9171396 this temple needs proper management so that more tourists could come here without facing discomfort it is disturbing for any religious minded to see a holy place in such a neglected state due to bad local arrangement
9171397 abre todas as vias para a consolida o da associa o econ mica e social e intensificar a coopera o
9171398 o acordo colocar fim aos 40 anos de falta de entendimento um reconhecimento completo e moral dos danos causados l bia pela it lia durante o per odo colonial
9171399 para ele a tecnologia t o natural quanto uma geladeira e isso bom
9171400 mas ao mesmo tempo o uso que ele faz da internet muito intenso ent o temos que supervisionar e colocar algum freio
9171401 eles costumam usar redes sociais como o orkut cujo termo de uso afirma que o cadastro para maiores de 18 anos jogos de simula o de realidade e mensageiros instant neos al m de fazer pesquisas
9171402 o barco estava superlotado porque as pessoas se desesperaram e come aram a escalar o barco para serem resgatadas
9171403 n s n o podemos avaliar a extens o dos danos colossal
9171404 n s s poderemos avaliar quando a gua retornar aos n veis habituais
9171405 initial investigations show that the bomb contained 75 80 g of explosives and that it was a time bomb we think it was hidden in a cardboard box the way it had been placed most of the injuries to the people must be below the waist
9171406 can i just point out nothing living can just stand beside lava then run away no matter how slow its going the temperature alone would burn that dogs face off
9171407 well to be honest george when you said you mounted some pussy this weekend i kind of thought that well you know what its not important this is very nice
9171408 if a tree f s you up in a car accident will you be covered dont hope so know so
9171409 its taking too long you havent even got to the head yet
9171410 we rely on our eyes every time we step into a car especially our peripheral vision depth perception and focusing skills
9171411 this link between vision and driving makes it essential for motorists to take steps to maintain healthy vision just as they take other safety precautions on the road
9171412 most people are aware of the dangers of drinking and driving but are unaware that driving drowsy can be just as fatal
9171413 in fact traffic safety and sleep experts believe that drowsy driving is much more common than even federal statistics indicate
9171414 the russians have checkpoints and we still cannot bring these people back home the threat of paramilitary irregulars looting and robbing is still very high
9171415 apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kind of cases
9171416 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle
9171417 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9171418 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9171419 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9171420 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9171421 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
9171422 my booklist was a short list with thin books to be honest but that was more because i didnt have the time i love reading i like reading all sorts of books its great to wind down and you learn a lot too
9171423 i try to think along with my club i watch a lot of football like the copa libertadores i saw two players who could really do well at ajax and i tipped van basten i did that at heerenveen as well one player was guerron a guy with a superb cross but he was signed for getafe so i can name his name now the other player i wont mention now
9171424 frustrated nah it doesnt feel like that at all youll get frustrated when youre close to a deal and then it doesnt happen you know there were some contacts but i only want to leave ajax for an absolute top club nothing less and yes real madrid that would be one of them anyone would want to play for madrid but im not doing one of those inbetween steps to a sub top european team why would i
9171425 i do notice of course that against russia or similar opponents its harder than against say fc utrecht but a move to some other competition isnt sacred i played against sunderland and newcastle united with ajax and heerenveen but i wasnt too impressed with their level its not arsenal chelsea in the epl every week you know
9171426 i know myself im very ambitious i wouldnt want to play for a mid tier team in spain or england and i have to play in or around the box i love the sport too much to go for a bigger club make more money but not win prizes or play great football i want the peaks and the troughs and i can have that with ajaz the top of holland
9171427 one goal per match should be feasible but i would be happy to score less as long as we win the title
9171428 and why not i also want to score in den haag and in volendam those are the only two stadiums in the eredivisie i never scored
9171429 we signed some exciting players but thats not it we need to be able to gel these players into the team
9171430 i came in the winter from heerenveen ajax wasnt doing too good lots of criticism danny blind was manager and there was a lot of debate on his future with the club we managed somehow to pull together and we did so well in the second half of the competition we won basically everything and came from a desperate position to the play offs winning the cl qualification ticket and the national cup
9171431 i love working on something big and i will take responsibility if people dont abide by the rules it can annoy me shitless and i will open my mouth i dont like powerplay though and i wont abuse my position i dont think you should talk too much in football you have to show it on the pitch
9171432 he is a great human being cery correct in his interactions and very involved with other players paul bosvelt at heerenveen was similar they were born captains
9171433 i think gabri and oleguer with their experience will be able to lead stekelenburg has it too and rasmus lindgren
9171434 i will never get used to that suddenly strangers start filming me on their mobile phones what is that that famous people game is nothing for me
9171435 klaas jan is a sweet funny and sharp kid he hasnt changed although he has a sort of tough layer of varnish over that personality dennis had that as well
9171436 i wont avoid public places like the cinema but i dont enjoy the attention i do like to visit the sports fishing show every year visma i like to meet people from all walks of life i recently spoke to an entrepreneur i love that someone who built a company from the ground up i like to read about that too the visma is always in rotterdam and its fun to get all those remarks from sports fishers from rotterdam
9171437 i havent won any real prizes with ajax psv has been stronger but its more their consistency than anything else they dont play very attractive or score a lot of goals but they know how to stop you from scoring psv is still the title favorite i guess they play some sort of counter football they allow the opponent to make the play and when you lose possession they quickly overturn you thats a great weapon and all but it is absolutely easier to play like that than the way ajax wants to play we play possession football and when we lose the ball we immediately have to go 30 meters back in full sprint takes more energy
9171438 the knee still hurts that isnt going to go away
9171439 i have to accept that did that tackle end my career well i never played a full game again did i it seems like a great coincidence dont you think
9171440 i had run ins with people every week but at the end of the game you shake hands and the problems stay on the field that is what should have happened between me and him i just hope now that he is different
9171441 he is now in charge of players and as a manager and coach has different responsibilities football is a sport and it should remain a sport there is a line that should not be crossed and i presume that he and his players know this now
9171442 the sending off was unfortunate it was an instinctive thing
9171443 but he had already been booked which meant he had to go i understand he now misses our first game in europe which is even more unfortunate
9171444 i wouldnt characterize it as a good pr move what i would say is that we are always concerned when someone takes his own life because as americans we value life even the lives of violent terrorists who are captured waging war against our country
9171445 did not know whether al utaybi had been informed about the transfer recommendation before he killed himself
9171446 a mid to high level al qaeda operative who had key ties to principal facilitators and senior members of the group
9171447 autopsies were performed by physicians from the armed forces institute of pathology at naval hospital guant namo on june 10 and 11
9171448 a short written statement declaring their intent to be martyrs was found in the pockets of each of the detainees
9171449 lengthier written statements were also found in each of their cells
9171450 it is not known yet how long the vaccine will protect even with the use of booster jabs protection may wane after 10 years or so these women will be vulnerable to infection later
9171451 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days
9171452 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
9171453 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
9171454 however in order to do more in afghanistan our marines have got to see relief elsewhere
9171455 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business
9171456 25 000 marines in the province are probably being in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
9171457 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
9171458 its actually difficult for a store today to carry plenty of items and yet avoid pvc
9171459 its use has gotten pretty ubiquitous among the large purveyors because its cheap and easy to work with
9171460 i have been doing this analysis of consumer goods for more than 10 years and ive never seen such high results
9171461 in addition phthalates are lipophilic meaning they are drawn to fat
9171462 if they come into contact with solutions or substances that have lipid content the fat could actually help draw the phthalates out of the plastic
9171463 theyd leach this sort of oily stuff they would turn milky
9171464 in the u s all of the companies that manufacture adult novelties whether theyre mom and pop or large corporations are privately held
9171465 none are required to publish financial information and none do
9171466 i remember trying in the early 90s to track down information on an oil used on beautiful hand carved wooden dildos was it safe to put into the body
9171467 the closest comparison we could find was the regulation governing wooden salad utensils
9171468 just like childrens teething toys were going to have to start doing the dialogue
9171469 while working at mattel as a toy designer i was made very aware of the concerns of using only safe materials for childrens products
9171470 this training has stuck with me we take great pride in using only the materials which meet strict toxicity safety standards for both the u s and the e u
9171471 our goal is to help people make an educated choice and give out as much information as we can find without alarming people
9171472 its part of our philosophy to put good things in the world and its counter to that to sell things that are toxic
9171473 the glass is going to be more lasting possibly safer and less toxic than something thats plastic
9171474 which is a little bit better alternative to the typical battery run toy where you just toss the batteries into the landfill
9171475 we have some floggers that are made of nylon rope natural rope and rubber
9171476 the same with the paddles collars cuffs and whatnot totally leather free animal product free
9171477 so many of us are used to shopping for organic food or ecologically safe building products or cosmetics
9171478 you can see a light bulb go off they realize its a consumer relationship and they can and should demand better products

9171483 we will not be able to reach most of those 1 7 million people
9171484 we will try to reach as many as possible but we havent even begun to do the essential preparatory work
9171485 since there are no elections we hope they will now go back to their core business
9171486 however if you choose not to act we will hold you personally responsible for the inhumane suffering caused by this ban
9171487 to talk about ngos being politicized to get support for the opposition its garbage
9171488 were hearing these anecdotes widely and early in the year and that indicates the situation in many areas is already serious

9171503 the government is helping us finance the purchase of new machinery
9171504 they reduced the interest rates we pay and have given us more time to pay off the loans its vital
9171505 in our country the government is trying to get money to subsidize other sectors of the economy
9171506 i think brazil is doing the opposite adapting to what the world is offering now theyre doing it right
9171507 we need to give incentives to producers because people are buying and eating more
9171508 this is our opportunity to produce and export more and help to reduce hunger in the world

9171691 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9171692 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9171693 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9171694 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9171695 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9171696 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9171697 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9171698 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9171699 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9171700 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9171701 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9171702 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9171703 who are open to doing something on the production side
9171704 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9171705 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9171706 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9171707 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9171708 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9171709 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9171710 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9171711 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9171712 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9171713 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9171714 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9171715 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9171716 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9171717 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9171718 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9171719 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9171720 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9171721 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9171722 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9171723 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9171724 is it cheaper on amazon does amazon have that edition in stock
9171725 one of the most important changes in communications in the past 100 years
9171726 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9171727 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9171728 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9171729 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9171730 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9171731 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9171732 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9171733 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9171734 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9171735 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9171736 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9171737 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9171738 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9171739 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9171740 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9171741 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9171742 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9171743 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9171744 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9171745 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9171746 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9171747 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9171748 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9171749 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9171750 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9171751 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

9171754 its a strategically brilliant development for mccain he desperately needed to woo evangelical voters
9171755 no republican has captured the white house in modern history without their support
9171756 governor palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives she has a record of advancing the culture of life at every opportunity
9171757 senator mccain made an outstanding pick shes solid on all the core social issues
9171758 i have five kids too and i think it is exciting when you see someone who is working actively to make her family a part of her mission
9171759 and her decision to have her child when she knew he had downs syndrome is a beautiful beautiful story
9171760 the mmd party does not appear to be united and i see possible cracks after the burial of mwanawasa because he was like a coating of paint hiding the cracks that have always existed in the party
9171761 they may pretend to rally behind one candidate after the selection process but there are serious divisions in there
9171762 we are sure we will be united even after we select a candidate
9171763 those who wish to go their own way after the selection process should not overestimate themselves and think they can win without party support
9171764 if you could come to care about them by the end of the film then i think that that was in a way a more political act than what a well meaning documentary could achieve
9171765 you are just humanising people who for so long have been marginalised to an issue or to an exotic location
9171766 the violence is what makes the headlines but most peoples daily lives have to do with being frustrated and terribly inconvenienced to the point that it just wears on them
9171767 they come to expect as a matter of routine that they are going to be detained

9171775 republican sen john mccain played the gender card like an ace friday with his surprise choice of alaska gov sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
9171776 i think his plan is made he wants an election period
9171777 its basically the equivalent of a midnight raid behind enemy lines
9171778 hillary said she made 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling well mccain just shattered it
9171779 the early feminists worked for the rights of women to vote and our right to life
9171780 this is one more step in a long march for womens history
9171781 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9171782 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9171783 governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9171784 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9171785 a member of the radical anti choice org feminists for life
9171786 shines a light on these issues more sharply than if he had picked just another guy
9171787 today we have begun a total strike in the government run health sector in the gaza strip and there is good participation with 70 percent taking part
9171788 the strikes follow calls issued by fatah run unions in ramallah
9171789 it is aimed at strengthening the blockade on hamas the palestinian government and the palestinian people
9171790 understood the motivations for it which come from the oppressive actions taken against our workers in the gaza strip
9171791 these poisonous calls come when there are more than 1 600 patients in desperate need of treatment and care
9171792 we will not let anyone mock the health security of our citizens
9171793 think of it as a dinner party thrown by revolutionaries
9171794 good food is not just for the middle class we want to make it accessible
9171795 when you take the time to do things right you are rewarded
9171796 the more you learn the more you realize you dont want to eat a lot of whats being shipped into supermarkets
9171797 i dont want to serve something to my guests that i wont eat myself
9171798 we dont take time to eat and celebrate food were on the run putting things in our body that dont make sense
9171799 this is a very grass roots effort that connects young artists environmentalists and young people all of whom are engaged for their own reason
9171800 we have to meet each other and understand our power as a group
9171801 there are seven women and two children among the wounded
9171802 there were fewer people today because of the rains from the morning
9171803 we heard the sound of a blast but we thought it was a firecracker it didnt sound like a huge bomb
9171804 several recent plots by the ltte to carry out bomb attacks targeting government installations public transport and civilians have been foiled following information of such terrorist plots being revealed by ltte cadres who were arrested by the police
9171805 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers
9171806 im very confident that there will be an absolute clearance for mr peters in a relatively short period of time
9171807 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9171808 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9171809 this is the law that would make it at the supreme court if planned parenthood assaults this law in south dakota we are ready there is money being raised for the legal costs to fight this all the way
9171810 one of our co chairs is a republican and the other is democrat
9171811 it is reasonable to expect it to win on the ballot
9171812 the court challenges by planned parenthood will likely begin sometime that november and would reach the
9171813 the u s supreme court will most likely have the best make up for an abortion bill when the case reaches the supreme court in 2011 or 2012 than any court is likely to have in the next ten or fifteen years

9171827 it is unacceptable that in a nation that is as prosperous as ours that 37 3 million people including 13 3 million children continue to live in poverty at 12 5 percent the poverty rate indicates that reducing poverty is not a priority for this nation
9171828 for catholic charities usa and our 1 700 local member agencies who serve nearly 8 million in need a year the poverty rate is not just another economic statistic this unacceptable figure represents the millions of families we see each and every day who are struggling just to make ends meet
9171829 substantial decreases in these numbers must occur in order to alleviate the struggles that millions are experiencing
9171830 the downturn in the economy is making matters worse across our nation catholic charities agencies are seeing more and more people having to choose between putting food on the table paying their utility bills or making their rent or mortgage payments
9171831 needing help with food rent clothing and prescriptions are all symptoms of much larger problems facing the poor and vulnerable in america such as low wages and the lack of affordable housing and health care
9171832 reducing poverty in the united states must be a national priority
9171833 let these troubling poverty statistics be a call to action for each of us as a nation we must demand that our current and future leaders give a much higher priority to the needs of the poor in their policymaking decisions
9171834 in this election year candidates for public office especially our presidential candidates must move from rhetoric to action and propose comprehensive plans to address the needs of more than 37 million people living in poverty in the united states over the next decade
9171835 we must no longer ignore the injustice of poverty and the extreme inequality in america

9171840 the market is conjuring up images of a replay of three years ago when katrina wreaked havoc on the refinery system in the gulf so were seeing a little spike from that
9171841 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9171842 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9171843 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9171844 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday

9171855 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9171856 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer
9171857 we encourage them to study it calculate what it means to them and their families and vote in their best interests on sept 3 this is our best and final offer and thats what it means

9171870 as tiene que ser eso ya se aparca hasta cuando toque tenemos que centrarnos en la liga s que todo el mundo decimos lo mismo pero cuesta reengancharnos viene el m laga un equipo que tendr hambre de volver a primera divisi n jugadores y t cnico y no va a ser f cil
9171871 el compromiso liguero es tan importante como el partido del otro d a si queremos algo bueno en la liga hay que hacerlo desde la jornada uno y no dejarlo para el final pelearnos en marzo o abril no de una vez hay que empezar con el pie derecho bien en casa aprovechar esta comuni n con la grada y a pegar primero
9171872 es normal que cuando la cosa rueda bien todo el mundo me incluyo yo nos relajamos bajamos un poquito el pist n y todo son alabanzas y viene el m laga que llega con los cuchillos afilados porque viene de segunda quiere hacernos sufrir y es labor m a con el grupo de entender que es un partido tan importante como ante el schalke el madrid o el barcelona cuando estemos en mayo sufriendo por ara ar esos puntitos para ver en qu lugar quedamos
9171873 es muy importante la labor de hablar mucho de centrarnos de internar aislarnos de todo lo bonito que es la familia los amigos y la afici n que nos ha alabado muchos estos d as bien recibidas merecidas inclusive me refiero a los jugadores pero ya estamos en faena porque si vamos de rositas podemos darnos un buen susto en la jornada uno tirar todo por la borda no cuesta nada
9171874 si viene alguna sorpresita al final pues bienvenida pero hoy me hago a la idea de que est cerrado el plantel no podemos cometer locuras ni fichar por agradar a alguien o desagradar a alguien aqu hay que ser inteligentes y sensatos el atl tico si lo analizas lleva un par de a os que no espera a las ltimas horas para fichar y en diciembre hace lo justo y ha caminado es lento pero ha caminado las prisas no son buenas consejeras
9171875 traer uno m s para agradar y no me hace diferencia no es distinto a lo que tengo pues en vez de ser una soluci n empieza a ser un problema hoy tuve que descartar a cinco de la convocatoria y otra carita m s seria entonces empieza a ser un problema ahora que es una s per figura pero ya no quedan y si quedan hay que pagar de 40 u 80 para arriba cifras que no tenemos
9171876 es el promedio que se maneja en todos los equipos cada a o es cierto que de repente hubo a os de doce o catorce jugadores eran revoluciones en ese momento seis contrataciones para la exigencia de la temporada est n muy bien
9171877 claro que nos afecta a todos los que estamos en esta sala todos lo notamos todos tenemos el d a a d a unos m s unos menos hay que pagar el colegio los libros echarle gasolina al coche ir al supermercado a comprar y vas notando tu tarjeta de cr dito normal no es queja es una realidad pero no lo digo yo lo dicen las cifras mundiales
9171878 hay que coger r pidamente el tono en la liga
9171879 no tiene nada que perder juega en casa y seguro que pondr las cosas dif ciles
9171880 hay que salir ah y ser ambiciosos agresivos intensos jugar bien y llevarnos los tres puntos
9171881 no importa el rival no importa el campo no importa el rbitro cuando no ganemos un partido ser porque nosotros no habremos estado acertados ma ana ni gamos ni perdemos la liga pero hay que empezar bien
9171882 yo estar aqu sentado hasta que los que manden decidan otra cosa
9171883 s que el bar a se ha gastado dinero y que ha recuperado mucho tambi n en las ventas hay temporadas que se gasta m s y otras menos pero la funci n del entrenador siempre es la misma hacer que el equipo juegue bien y que gane yo estar aqu sentado hasta que los que manden decidan otra cosa

9171887 me gustar a que estuviese cerrado pero no es as no puede ir a la coru a pasan muchas cosas y hoy no puede estar cerrado todo lo estar el d a 2 de septiembre
9171888 no se ha negado a viajar he tomado la decisi n yo creo que es mejor que se quede esperar a que se resuelva el tema definitivamente a partir de la semana que viene cuando regrese de su selecci n sabremos c mo tratarlo y cambiar a todo
9171889 para nosotros sigue siendo el mismo jugador importante pero tenemos que mirar las condiciones en las que llega el jugador se ha visto que en ltimas semanas la presi n de su entorno fue m s fuerte hubo declaraciones y el jugador no est en condiciones
9171890 en la ida en valencia nos dimos cuenta de que no pod amos ir a m s porque l est preocupado con presi n y la cabeza fuera nosotros quer amos ganar la supercopa era mejor no meterle y utilizar jugadores comprometidos con nosotros por eso fue el cambio y ahora no le llevamos hasta que no se resuelva el tema no podemos utilizarle

9171897 para nosotros sigue siendo el mismo jugador importante pero tenemos que mirar las condiciones en las que llega el jugador se ha visto que en ltimas semanas la presi n de su entorno fue m s fuerte hubo declaraciones y el jugador no est en condiciones
9171898 en la ida en valencia nos dimos cuenta de que no pod amos ir a m s porque l est preocupado con presi n y la cabeza fuera nosotros quer amos ganar la supercopa era mejor no meterle y utilizar jugadores comprometidos con nosotros por eso fue el cambio y ahora no le llevamos hasta que no se resuelva el tema no podemos utilizarle

9171906 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
9171907 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
9171908 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9171909 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
9171910 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
9171911 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity and some assumed we would continue with both no matter the outcome but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9171912 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to facts their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
9171913 we plan to take them with us we do not know what we will expect at sea we have had indications that israel might stop us but we know full well that the palestinians that are coming with us have the right papers have the right visas and they should be allowed to travel there is no reason why israel is holding them hostage holding them prisoners in gaza and denying them medical attention denying them education denying them family reunification
9171914 the suspicion would arise that someone in the us created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates they needed a small victorious war
9171915 we are in the process of re evaluating our relationship with russia and we are doing that in concert with our international partners such as france but also many others including germany and all of the nato countries its premature to say i dont know what ultimately will result from the process that people are going to discuss what the consequences may be
9171916 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
9171917 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
9171918 hillary this time i cant go with you i got to go with obama

9171930 breaking with convention war peace and the presidency from the streets to the suites to the convention floor
9171931 five score years ago a great american in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the emancipation proclamation
9171932 we have come to the nations capital to cash a check that has been returned to us insufficient funds i refuse to believe that the great vaults of democracy are empty
9171933 we are marooned on a tiny island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity
9171934 negroes in the south cant vote and negroes in the north believe they have nothing for which to vote
9171935 the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of this nation
9171936 hey we got to tone that down a little bit because the old man a philip randolph has been imagining this speech for decades imagining this march for decades please lets not interrupt the broader march here and lets not forget the bigger picture
9171937 wait a minute we should be doing this in a court youre taking this to the street
9171938 if you want a great sermon be a great audience
9171939 tell us why martin luther king jr would support you
9171940 he wouldnt he wouldnt support any presidential candidate he would get america as a public to hold me accountable because change happens from the bottom up not the top down
9171941 you dont protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington

9171943 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
9171944 the obama candidacy is built on the organizational foundation laid by these women at least as much as it is on the oratorical showmanship of black male preachers
9171945 you cannot seat the all white mississippi delegation because to do so would erase the reality of black people throughout the south
9171946 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story

9171960 were going to ask people to get into the stadium cheer for the tigers and then try to disperse as quickly as possible
9171961 that may strike you as a little odd but we wanted to make sure we had all our friends and fans off of campus and out of harms way
9171962 anticipate that its going to be the same environment on our campus as it was during katrina
9171963 everything draws and we need every bit of power we can get

9171965 im sorry to report that your colleagues at the reveille chose to destroy their relationship with me last year so i know longer do interviews for that group
9171966 since lsu knows that they are located in a hurricane zone wed expect that theyve constructed hurricane proof housing for the tiger and made provisions to evacuate mike to an area of safety
9171967 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9171968 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back

9171970 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
9171971 my greatest regret is that under our constitution the american people can have almost anything they want but it just seems they dont want much of anything at all
9171972 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get ten to twenty

9172004 by every measure of petroleum security or vulnerability that we have examined the united states is as vulnerable and in most cases more so than at the time of the 1973 embargo
9172005 those who are short of food those who are short of water those who cant move to countries where it looks as if everything is marvelous are going to be people who are going to adopt desperate measures to try to make their point
9172006 for years too many of us have viewed global warming as simply an environmental or economic issue we now need to consider it as a security concern
9172007 many of the most severe effects of global warming are expected in regions where fragile governments are least capable of responding to them failing to recognize and plan for the geopolitical consequences of global warming would be a serious mistake

9172079 its unfortunate what happened to enrique in sonoma last week and that its causing him to miss this weeks race
9172080 alex will help us this weekend especially because he knows the track and he has a lot of experience racing not about these cars though and well look at the situation after that it will be a challenge because he wont have much time in the car but i think hes the guy who can do it

9172111 how successful we will be will be will rely on when the team starts believing in themselves
9172112 we need to play to our full potential to be successful

9172114 we have the experience this year to be one of the best teams in the state
9172115 if all of our players can crack 50 we will certainly improve
9172116 we have strength from top to bottom meaning a definite improvement over last season
9172117 because of our inexperience we need our leaders to step up
9172118 we lost some of our top guys so we really need our younger guys to step up
9172119 and if it doesnt it can be replaced under warranty
9172120 we have received authentic information that the death toll is 100

9172128 weve put a 7m bid on the table to manchester united
9172129 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian
9172130 as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation
9172131 if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring him to the football club
9172132 theyll be a lot of people alluding to the fact weve got carried away with ourselves but i can absolutely guarantee that im here for the long term building the football club
9172133 its a strategically brilliant development for mccain he desperately needed to woo evangelical voters
9172134 no republican has captured the white house in modern history without their support
9172135 governor palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives she has a record of advancing the culture of life at every opportunity
9172136 senator mccain made an outstanding pick shes solid on all the core social issues
9172137 i have five kids too and i think it is exciting when you see someone who is working actively to make her family a part of her mission
9172138 and her decision to have her child when she knew he had downs syndrome is a beautiful beautiful story
9172139 the icc board on sunday agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy until october 2009
9172140 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
9172141 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams

9172184 i am very disappointed at the high number of vehicles seen with items on display or evidence they have been there
9172185 simply removing items of value from your vehicle and locking it makes it less attractive for a thief yet hundreds of drivers in the town are continuing to put their property at risk
9172186 criminals will break into your vehicle if they see something worth taking if you leave your mobile phone charger plugged in the thief will go looking for the handset
9172187 if theres a mark left on the windscreen after you removed your sat nav cradle the thief will wonder if the units in the glove compartment or boot
9172188 if theres a coat on the back seat the thief will think there might be a wallet in the pocket or something hidden underneath
9172189 i dont know of any evidence that would lead me to believe that violence on tv has any detrimental effect on normal children
9172190 there has been so many studies in this area in all parts of the world and there is no obvious clear cut informatiion as to what affect violence on tv has on children
9172191 night time tv is disgraceful ive had enough of police series such as the rockford files cop shop starsky and hutch charlies angels and so on unless youre a fan of the restless years which is about as interesting as a cake of soap melting there is nothing worth watching at night
9172192 i am sick of people whingeing about things they dont even have to look at
9172193 the company spends about 6 billion a year on programming to give our customers the best content and the most video choices
9172194 while we have been aggressive at controlling costs we expect continued increases in programming particularly in sports
9172195 theyre raising rates on individual service to push people to bundles because that means they get more money but the reality is now consumers have fewer and fewer choices
9172196 nikki thinks the running of the bulls should be changed amp we should be chased by the spainish sic mens hockey team

9172201 im always so careful to ensure the sport is portrayed in the best possible way we dont drink in public or silly things like that
9172202 the organisation is disappointed that private communications has entered the public domain and players will again be counselled on this matter
9172203 i think everyone outside of st helens wants hull to win today not just because they are underdogs but because saints are so arrogant

9172210 what do community organizers actually do how do they do it and how has obamas experience as a community organizer shaped his run for the presidency
9172211 one of my fundamental beliefs from my days as a community organizer is that real change comes from the bottom up and theres no more powerful tool for grassroots organizing than the internet
9172212 a cesspool of hate the poles slovaks germans negroes mexicans and lithuanians all hated each other and all of them hated the irish who returned the sentiment in spades

9172220 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
9172221 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
9172222 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
9172223 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
9172224 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
9172225 i think we are only going to make headway with a legal requirement
9172226 experts say it is technically possible to block access and there is no opposition from the european union so why do we have nothing in germany
9172227 i have the impression that we will soon have to justify why we are not taking the lead

9172233 by joel gulledge a member of the christian peacemaker team and i applaud all who dare step up to try to help protect and nurture the children of palestine
9172234 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system

9172239 to have been chosen brings a great challenge i know it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9172240 its always safest in politics to avoid risk to sort of go along status quo but i didnt get into politics to do the safe things a ship in harbour is safe but thats not what it was built for

9172252 there is hardly any chance that musharraf will ever be tried in pakistan
9172253 hes laughed off the reports that he is about to leave the country
9172254 he said im not going anywhere im staying in pakistan my house is being built and it will take another three or four months to complete
9172255 many people said the wall should be very high considering the security threats
9172256 but somehow mr musharraf has such a relaxed and cool personality that he said i dont want it to look like a huge fortified castle
9172257 what we learned from hurricane katrina is that disaster preparedness efforts must focus on evacuating and caring for vulnerable populations particularly the elderly including those in hospitals nursing homes and private residences

9172281 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9172282 its important i tell people in this country that we along with every other country in the world face a unique set of circumstances where youve got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices
9172283 take action to help the economy and to help people get through this difficult time
9172284 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9172285 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9172286 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9172287 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9172288 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9172289 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression
9172290 these are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with
9172291 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
9172292 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
9172293 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
9172294 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
9172295 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
9172296 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
9172297 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
9172298 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

9172309 una mozione allars per mantenere il nome pio la torre
9172310 servono tempi lunghi per lattuazione soprattutto nelle regioni del sud
9172311 ill keep going for as long as i can i love chatting and serving the customers the club is a second home to me
9172312 theres no secret to how im still working i just do normal things eat normal food and do the shopping
9172313 it certainly helps you keep active and thats just what i need at my age
9172314 its absolutely incredibly that he still insists on doing work behind the bar
9172315 he loves serving members when they come in we had a beer festival recently and he insisted on helping out at the door as well
9172316 we all knew this year would be hard and traumatic if we have another year like this youll not have a harris tweed industry there will be no weavers
9172317 they are on the breadline if the situation is not as serious as it is you would not have the minister coming here to solve the problem
9172318 i dont think it is unreasonable to expect a full time weaver to earn 25 000 pounds a year but the tweed is selling at primark prices it is being sold at 16 pounds a metre while it needs to be more like 25 pounds a metre
9172319 there can not be a more arrogant doc anywhere in any er
9172320 he should really be locked up and the key thrown away and maybe for good measure injected with something really nasty
9172321 ramadhan is the month in which the quran was revealed a guidance for mankind and clear proofs of the guidance and as a criterion al furqan
9172322 whoever speaks about the quran without knowledge then let him prepare for himself his seat in the fire
9172323 the jamaa is haq truth even if it is one person
9172324 they ask you about the crescents say they are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in the affairs of men and for pilgrimage
9172325 whoever witnesses the crescent of the month he must fast the month
9172326 do not fast till you see the new moon and do not break fast till you see it but if the weather is cloudy complete it thirty days
9172327 the month is thus and thus he then withdrew his thumb at the third time indicating 29 he then said fast when you see it and break your fast when you see it and if the weather is cloudy do calculate it the months of shaban and shawwal as thirty days
9172328 the month consists of 29 nights so do not fast till you have sighted it i e the new moon and if the weather were cloudy then complete it as thirty days
9172329 the month of ramadhan may consist of twenty nine days so do not fast until you have sighted it the new moon and do not break fast until you have sighted it the new moon of shawwal and if the sky is cloudy for you then complete it thirty days
9172330 the month of ramadhan may consist of twenty nine days so when you see the new moon observe fast and when you see the new moon again at the commencement of the month of shawwal then break it and if the sky is cloudy for you then calculate it and complete thirty days
9172331 do not fast till you see it and do not break fast till you see it
9172332 do fast when you it is sighted and break fast when it is sighted
9172333 during the time of the prophet saas the companions went looking for the new crescent so i told the prophet saw that i saw it so he fasted and told the companions to fast
9172334 and eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears to you distinct from its black thread then complete your fast until the night appears
9172335 i arrived in al sham and did business for her umm ul fadhl bintu l harith
9172336 when did you see it i said we saw it on the night of friday he said did you see it yourself i said yes and the people also saw it and observed the fast and muawiya also observed the fast whereupon he said but we saw it on saturday night some would continue to observe fast till we complete thirty fasts or we see it the new moon of shawwal i said is the sighting of the moon by muawiya not valid for you he said no this is how the messenger of allah saw has commanded us
9172337 this is how the messenger of allah saw commanded us
9172338 fast when you see it and break fast when you see it
9172339 i realise that the evidence is derived from the report of ibnu abbas and not from his ijtihad exertion which people understood as such and what is referred in his saying
9172340 do not fast till you see the new moon and do not break fast till you see the new moon and if the sky were cloudy then complete it as thirty days
9172341 to summarize a person who learns about the sighting of the moon in good time to be able to utilise it for fasting for ending his fast or for sacrifice he must definitely do so the texts of islam and the reports about the salaf point to this to limit this to a certain distance or country would contradict both the reason and the shar islamic law
9172342 it was cloudy and we could not see the new moon of shawwaal so we started the day fasting then a caravan came at the end of the day and told the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him that they had seen the new moon of shawwaal the day before so he told the people to stop fasting and they went out to pray the eid prayer the next day
9172343 if the people of calcutta sighted the moon in friday whereas it was sighted in makkah on thursday itself but the people of calcutta did not know of it the sighting on thursday then whenever they come to know of this it will be obligatory for them to celebrate eid with the people of makkah and make up qada for the first fasting
9172344 wherever the sighting is confirmed however far off it may be even if it were to be thousands of miles the people of this place will have to abide by that
9172345 question there has been some dispute in amritsar etc regarding sighting of moon for ramdhan and eid ul fitr so should we the residents of mandla cp which is located very far off follow that sighting or not
9172346 fast when it is sighted and stop fasting when it is sighted
9172347 irrespective of how far the news of sighting came from it is to be relied upon for instance if the people of burma did not sight the moon and a person from bombay testifies to them of having sighted the moon it will be incumbent upon the people of burma to make up for the first fasting i e qada
9172348 when the moon is sighted in one place it is not just for that region but for the entire world
9172349 in the correct and authentic mazhab of our imams with regard to the sighting of moon for ramdhan and eid distance of the place of sighting is of no consideration the sighting of the east is binding upon west and vice versa i e the sighting of west is similarly binding on east
9172350 we are ummiyah unlettered people we neither write nor calculate the month is this way and that sometimes 29 days and sometimes 30
9172351 if you see an imam who does not begin and end fasting by way of sighting but begins fasting by calculation he should not be followed in prayer or emulated
9172352 some of our people erred when they reported that imam shafi relied on calculations
9172353 the people used to ask the prophet of allah saw about the good and i used to ask him about the bad in fear that it might catch me so i said o prophet of allah we were in times of jahilliyah and mischief then allah brought us this good so is there any mischief after this good he saw said yes i said will there be any good after that mischief he said yes and it has smoke i said what is its smoke he said some people guide without any guidance you recognise some from them and deny some i said will there be a mischief after that good he said yes some people who invite at the doors of hell whoever accepted their invitation they throw him in it hell i said o prophet of allah describe them to us he said they are of our own skin of our people and talk our language i said what do you order me to do if that matter caught me he said adhere to the jamaah of muslims and their imam i said what if the muslims have no jamaah nor an imam he said then you abandon all those groups even if you have to grab with your teeth the trunk of a tree till death comes to you as such
9172354 the master of martyrs sayyid al shuhada is hamza and a man who stands up to a tyrant ruler and gives him nasiha advice and so the ruler kills him
9172355 he is not one of us who calls for asabiyyah nationalism or who fights for asabiyyah or who dies for asabiyyah
9172356 youll never believe what so and so did today it was sooo awful
9172357 its ok youre a strong girl you can get through this only nine more days and then it will be over
9172358 hunny i love you but seriously buck up it is almost finished so just deal with it
9172359 dont waste time our stay on this earth is quite short

9172361 look he doesnt like green eggs and ham get off his ass
9172362 not in a house not with a mouse not on a boat with a goat
9172363 instead of dwelling on specifics he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes that republicans mock
9172364 even allowing for a late splurge of transfers undoubtedly it is down in terms of monetary value
9172365 there is no doubt that the impact of broader worldwide ownership and the various forms of financing that change of ownership of many of the clubs in recent years has started to lead to a squeeze of the availability of cash for transfers
9172366 the credit crunch has caused some of the owners major cash flow problems
9172367 the difficulty you have here is with putting someone as unusual as roman abramovich into the same bracket as some of the others
9172368 there is no doubt that he is an exceptionally wealthy individual and most of the others have not got quite that level of wealth
9172369 indeed several of them are relying on borrowings to finance the purchase of their clubs or for ongoing expenditure and people relying on borrowings are facing the biggest difficulties
9172370 it is not surprising that the transfer market has slowed down
9172371 the reality is that the clubs who want to buy are shopping in a small pool of quality players who are available and at the right sort of price
9172372 invariably you get these stand offs like we have seen in particular with tottenham who have been really really pushing
9172373 the berbatov example is the most high profile but there have been any number of others for very much the same reason that have resulted in stand offs and that is more to do with financial constraints than anything else
9172374 sunderland were fortunate in the timing of that promotion and the fact they managed to get in there with relatively new owners before the credit crunch and the downturn in the irish economy started to impact
9172375 whether you are promoted or not but particularly the promoted clubs the evidence is that you have got to spend your money and spend it wisely to stay up
9172376 if you do a derby county and dont spend the money you are going to be embarrassed
9172377 but the reality is that the timing of that from sunderlands point of view was fortuitous in terms of the world economy
9172378 you would have been surprised if it had been repeated again this summer had they been in the same situation
9172379 i am pro life and i believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman
9172380 i support flexibility in government regulations that allow competition in health care that is needed
9172381 children with down syndrome require an awful lot of attention and the role of vice president it seems to me would take up an awful lot of her time it raises the issue of how much time will she have to dedicate to her newborn child
9172382 if it were a man being picked who also had a baby with down syndrome would you also ask the same question
9172383 can be tough against a woman doesnt it give her a gender advantage
9172384 you cant be too tough on a woman in a debate or can you
9172385 my ideal fantasy is to be running on a hot dusty road just wearing running shorts and some kind of top that wicks away sweat
9172386 a skinny white chocolate mocha is my staple in the morning
9172387 our first story tonight is from andrea mitchell who has learned that sen
9172388 also ahead nbc news correspondent lee cowan is traveling with sen obama and reports that he is a really big tipper and his teeth are perfect
9172389 continuing with our election coverage chuck todd will analyze exactly how michelle obama came to be so smart and good looking by the way my wife has a dress very similar to the one mrs obama wore on stage in denver she likes it a lot
9172390 after chuck files his report maria menounos has an exclusive story on how the rev
9172391 finally tom brokaw will take a look back at the entire obama family tree
9172392 as for john mccain there is a rumor he has been denied aarp membership because he is too old
9172393 chief trivetts enthusiasm for the nishnawbe aski police service was matched only by his dedication and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this time
9172394 the people of nishnawbe aski will miss his compassion and professionalism and i am confident that his spirit will live on through his officers and the tremendous work they do in our communities under very challenging and often quite dangerous conditions
9172395 the players are very aware of the fact that we need to get some points on the board chelsea coming at this time is a great fixture for us to lift the spirits
9172396 you know you are playing against one of the top sides in the league and that spurs you on
9172397 if you go there and try to put everyone behind the ball and defend that it is likely to end in defeat
9172398 the important thing is to go there and play attacking ambitious football
9172399 if you go there and show character and attack that is the way forward
9172400 you should treat everyone the same but sometimes you put in the better performances against the better clubs the whole team does as well as me
9172401 chelsea will definitely be a bit wary of us because weve tended to do well against them recently especially in the carling cup final last season
9172402 it was one of the most important goals of my career
9172403 i wasnt really scoring goals at the time and there was a lot said about it so the importance of the goal meant a lot to the fans club and me as well
9172404 weve not been good enough with the players weve had weve been more than capable of winning our first two games
9172405 everyone has a bad run through the season and hopefully this is it and getting a result against chelsea can kick start our season
9172406 ive looked at the fixtures and weve got a run of games we can get results in
9172407 its about belief you go out with the right mentality to get the result weve got players to put on a real show but weve got to earn the right to do so
9172408 we might need to be more harder to beat it will come right its not too early to get disheartened
9172409 he does pull more from democrats but not as much as people think
9172410 are generally more successful in life in areas including salary and winning presidential elections but this doesnt happen for women the chances of marriage and children are higher for taller men but the reverse is true for women
9172411 who were you thinking of when we were making love last night was it a good looking stranger or a close friend of mine
9172412 i dont know how they could have done it any better
9172413 hes awesome in the film i saw it a week before he passed i was talking to his manager who said he never got a chance to see it thats a tragedy because its one of the best things hes ever done its the bernie we know and its the bernie we love
9172414 bernie was thinner because hed been sick off and on for a while so he wasnt that american football looking guy that i used to know
9172415 we are a creature that forms bonds forms attachments this circuitry for attachment is very strong it doesnt stop pumping out its chemicals just because theres a big problem in the relationship
9172416 one of the beautiful things about baseball is that every once in a while you come into a situation where you want to and where you have to reach down and prove something
9172417 maybe that decision by the philadelphia inquirer to hold back most of the newspapers copy from its website
9172418 most rational people would find it quite acceptable if he were to be taken out and shot in the
9172419 this ice cream is do delicious i might steal a tub for myself
9172420 this symbolic fasting is done in order to purify one self from negative actions and to accumulate good karma to stress the non violent perseverance in struggle for the ideals of freedom justice democracy freedom of expression and for transparent political order for the whole world tibetan and chinese people in particular
9172421 i hope todays collective fasting and praying will suitably express that struggle for justice peace and good will among all sentient beings
9172422 we are immensely fortunate and grateful that his holiness the dalai lama has consented to take part in person here but due to a slight indisposition this could not happen
9172423 however his holiness is observing the fasting and prayer from mumbai today and we convey our immense gratitude and respect to him
9172424 protest led by hatred rancour and anger but by the teachings of the lord buddha in all the vehicles to refrain from harming others and do everything to benefit others with love and compassion which is the essence of spiritual practice
9172425 due to the consistent effort and guidance of his holiness the dalai lama to pursue non violent methods to resolve the tibetan issue it has been many years that most of the tibetan movements remained free from gross physical violence he said
9172426 this garnered immense support from around the world for the just cause of tibet
9172427 our pursuit of non violence has not only enabled us to keep alive the tibetan issue but also compelled the peoples republic of china to respond to our policy of rapprochement irrespective of their sincerity
9172428 ultimately help change the mind of the prc authorities to more compassionate
9172429 concerted non violent efforts to bring natural end to the torture and persecution in tibet
9172430 we pay our condolence and homage to those who lost their lives and those who are imprisoned tortured and beaten in the recent uprisings in tibet
9172431 we also pray and sympathise for the victims of the earthquakes in sichuan and the one in south western tibet recently and the disaster caused by flood in some other part as well
9172432 if it stays on this southwest louisiana track gustav will be like a hybrid between katrina and rita
9172433 and right in the middle youve got the huge atchafalaya basin i just hope people dont wait too long
9172434 we want people to be worried about their personal safety

9172444 what if i hurt someone or worse what if this is what dad warned you about
9172445 you know your buddy didnt pay for the booze or the smokes which he illegally lit up
9172446 whats goin on with you sam the smokin throwin bottles at people that sounds more like me than you

9172448 yeah he left before dawn in your car and you shoulda gone with him cuz now ima have to charge you extra
9172449 sorry to bother you but my son snuck out of the house last night and uh went to a justin timberlake concert what yes justin is quite the triple threat

9172451 what exactly did your mom tell you about how your dad died
9172452 cmon its me you can tell me anything you know that answer the question
9172453 our dads were in california devils gate reservoir they were setting a trap for some kind of hellspawn
9172454 ahahahaha thats just like john i be he dangled bill like meat on a hook
9172455 ysee bill was all clawed up holding his insides in his hands he was gurgling and praying to see you and ellen one more time so my dad killed him put him out of his misery like a sick dog
9172456 dean back from the dead getting to be a regular thing for you isnt it like a cockroach
9172457 its a binding link its like a lock hes locked himself inside sams body
9172458 yknow when people wanna describe the worst possible thing they say its like hell well theres a reason for that hell is like um well its like hell
9172459 but whatever i do to you its nothing compared to what you do to yourself is it i can see it in your eyes dean youre worthless
9172460 sam when dad told me that i might have to kill you it was only if i couldnt save you now if its the last thing i do im gonna save you
9172461 in the interests of the safety of all students as well as in recognition of the schools physical environment
9172462 the school will work with its parents and citizens committee and the school community to ensure an appropriate balance between student safety and their right to engage in gymnastic activities
9172463 has since undergone hospital surgical medical and para medical treatment
9172464 we make every effort to minimise risk for the girls
9172465 its all part of this wussification syndrome that were seeing in contemporary australia where schools have been forced to bow to the great god of occupational health and safety
9172466 we have schools in victoria which have banned birthday cakes with candles on them because the children might burst into flames and where soccer has been banned during recess because the kids might be hit in the face by the ball
9172467 children are not accessories to dress up and keep behind glass if we continue to cloak them in cotton wool and outsource their development to lawyers we will have a bunch of kids who are almost frightened of the world this is very serious
9172468 when you do something thats a little bit on the edge the lessons are learnt before you get to an age when the toys youre playing with can potentially kill
9172469 if they havent learnt appropriate risk taking before theyre in charge of a motor vehicle the consequences are often fatal
9172470 hovering over their children keeping the germs away and making sure that theyre safe
9172471 if you extend this ludicrousness to its logical end no child will ever learn to ride a bicycle because they might fall off
9172472 an essential part of growing up is exposure to the fact that life isnt always fair
9172473 when things do go wrong children can pick themselves up start again and learn from the negative experience
9172474 because were sheltering them from that im seeing 12 and 13 year old kids who are just normally sad because their dogs died or their parents have divorced and theyre running off to gps looking for anti depressants because they think theyre depressed
9172475 but schools have increasingly sanitised the playing environment for kids taking out a lot of the monkey bars in order to protect from litigation
9172476 as a result if kids do any physical activity its usually not involving their upper body most kids today couldnt hang and support their weight
9172477 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
9172478 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
9172479 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
9172480 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
9172481 as a piece of writing soars to the level of mediocrity maybe the crassly explicit langauage the obscenity of the plot were thought to strike an agreeably avant garde note perhaps it is all a joke meant to fool literary london into respect for rubbish
9172482 no masterpiece and one of the most disagreeable pieces of reading that has come my way in quite a while
9172483 thats a pretty good debut for a 15 year old starting quarterback
9172484 it was really cool i dreamed of it for a long time
9172485 we played really good and i want to come back and have a strong week of practice and keep my head up
9172486 when you cant punch it in there thats not acceptable
9172487 pah ha ha you dont rember by the look of things do you
9172488 you picked up a handful of mud and smeared it all over your face saying

9172537 when it was his turn he knew how everything worked so he could communicate
9172538 sure there was a sibling rivalry kurt had a nice rc radio controlled car and kyle wanted one too to race in our cul de sac so my wife gaye got him one from radio shack kyle didnt want that one he wanted the one like kurt

9172561 the very positive contribution that this sector makes to employment is of utmost importance to our vision of shared and equitable growth this sector provides employment to over 42 million people it contributes about 45 per cent of the total manufacturing output and nearly 40 per cent of indias exports it is the capacity of this sector to generate economic activity at the local level that prompted gandhiji to give the pride of place to khadi he dreamt of an india comprising of self contained villages using local raw materials local skills serving local markets and providing employment to people locally near the places where they live
9172562 this sector has shown continued dynamism in terms of growth in the number of enterprises production and the capacity to contribute to manufacturing output and exports there were apprehensions about the impact of liberalization on the growth of this sector however experience during the past decade has amply demonstrated that this sector cannot only survive competition but can also grow faster than the overall manufacturing sector this demonstrates the high degree of resilience entrepreneurial skills and the capacity for adaptation of people operating in this important sector
9172563 the family has decided to put behind the past and offer prayers to the almighty for clearing haneefs name
9172564 during those days every minute appeared to be one long year of trial and tribulation
9172565 but even in those trying moments we were deep inside convinced that haneef could do no wrong there was never a moment of doubt in our minds all we knew was that he was wrongly framed and he must be cleared of the charges
9172566 it is a testimony that the almighty has been with us all the time

9172571 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer

9172616 its important i tell people in this country that we along with every other country in the world face a unique set of circumstances where youve got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices
9172617 take action to help the economy and to help people get through this difficult time
9172618 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9172619 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9172620 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9172621 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9172622 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9172623 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression
9172624 these are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with

9172628 anyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible he is not bound to choose that pattern which best pays the treasury there is not even a patriotic duty to increase ones taxes over and over again the courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible everyone does it rich and poor alike and all do right for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands

9172648 one of the central issues in nanotechnology is the development of simple and reliable methods to precisely arrange molecules and other nanoscopic objects one promising route intensively investigated by scientists around the world involves the ability of molecules to spontaneously assemble onto a surface what we have done is successfully combined two strategies which are complementary but so far have been explored independently and it is this combination which opens up unprecedented opportunities for accessing the ultrasmall length scale
9172649 the potential of this approach lies in its flexibility on a scale about 1 10000 of the diameter of a human hair using molecules as building units the features of our structures are less than 5 nanometres in size which enables us to control structures and materials at dimensions where new properties emerge
9172650 we are just at the beginning of the exploration of a very exciting new area ongoing and future work will investigate changes in the dimensions and geometry of the network where the aim is to get exact control over the arrangement of molecules ultimately at the level of single molecules
9172651 in the short term this development provides us with an easily accessible platform for fundamental studies of phenomena on the ultrasmall scale
9172652 in the future we might be able to use this technology for the assembly of nanomachines molecular devices used to transport and manipulate molecules and nanometer sized objects

9172664 one of the greatest challenges preventing advances in new therapeutic options for treating cancer is the inability of anticancer drugs to effectively differentiate between cancerous and normal healthy body cells
9172665 many commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs target rapidly dividing cells but suffer from a relatively low therapeutic index which is the ratio of toxic dose to effective dose
9172666 preferential killing of cancer cells and activated human t cells using zno nanoparticles
9172667 until now no group in the world has been able to produce inherent selective cancer killing ability in nanoparticles
9172668 current chemotherapy drugs typically consist of single molecules and do not provide much room for manipulation of the molecule but nanoparticles can be modified so that certain characteristics like cancer killing attributes can be accentuated because of this we think there is room for improvement in what we have already demonstrated
9172669 oncology is always looking for a magic bullet which can kill only the cancer cells not killing the normal cells this work is a major step toward that
9172670 i think this work will pave the way for more targeted therapies

9172722 so how does a mother of five children especially one with special needs accept the nomination for a job that will put her within a heartbeat of the presidency and take yet take her away from the five heartbeats of her family for at least four years and still be considered conservative if she were a democratic nominee wouldnt the religious right be attacking her already i believe in a womans right to any career she desires yet as a mother of kids whose needs have taken precedence over my career for over a decade i know the realities of special needs parenting and i find myself asking a question that makes me feel like donna reed once youve chosen to have five children and your infant has special needs who needs you more your family or your job and if i can ask this touchy old fashioned question i wonder if conservatives will warm to a woman willing to make such a profound family sacrifice

9172736 if you could come to care about them by the end of the film then i think that that was in a way a more political act than what a well meaning documentary could achieve
9172737 you are just humanizing people who for so long have been marginalized to an issue or to an exotic location
9172738 the violence is what makes the headlines but most peoples daily lives have to do with being frustrated and terribly inconvenienced to the point that it just wears on them

9172744 as was the case with e commerce in the 1990s the initial popularity and hype surrounding world 0 led many companies to rush into virtual worlds without first creating solid business plans as companies learn from their mistakes and gear up for the second round of innovation and application it is likely that investment flows into world 0 will increase substantially

9172761 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9172762 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9172763 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9172764 but i do believe there will be certain assets that as we are already looking at the picture right now well be able to recommend can be either redeployed or not deployed to the theater in the fall
9172765 the iraqi surge is the major differentiator with previous operations
9172766 we feel better more secure and safe we can go outside without being frightened
9172767 security can freeze diyala so it doesnt get any worse but politics is needed to solve it
9172768 the only way of really solving diyala is through the political roots such as provincial elections and a more balanced provincial council
9172769 al qaida in iraq is really hoping to survive and sustain its struggle over time and hoping that its forces will change in the future but not engaging any direct contact now
9172770 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9172771 it wasnt a georgian attack on tskhinvali that launched all of this
9172772 it was russian pressure over a long period of time and then shelling coming from south ossetians
9172773 was not a wise thing to do because as weve seen russia was prepared to launch a major invasion

9172796 the very positive contribution that this sector makes to employment is of utmost importance to our vision of shared and equitable growth this sector provides employment to over 42 million people it contributes about 45 per cent of the total manufacturing output and nearly 40 per cent of indias exports it is the capacity of this sector to generate economic activity at the local level that prompted gandhiji to give the pride of place to khadi he dreamt of an india comprising of self contained villages using local raw materials local skills serving local markets and providing employment to people locally near the places where they live
9172797 this sector has shown continued dynamism in terms of growth in the number of enterprises production and the capacity to contribute to manufacturing output and exports there were apprehensions about the impact of liberalization on the growth of this sector however experience during the past decade has amply demonstrated that this sector cannot only survive competition but can also grow faster than the overall manufacturing sector this demonstrates the high degree of resilience entrepreneurial skills and the capacity for adaptation of people operating in this important sector

9172804 we all knew this year would be hard and traumatic if we have another year like this youll not have a harris tweed industry there will be no weavers
9172805 they are on the breadline if the situation is not as serious as it is you would not have the minister coming here to solve the problem
9172806 i dont think it is unreasonable to expect a full time weaver to earn 25 000 pounds a year but the tweed is selling at primark prices it is being sold at 16 pounds a metre while it needs to be more like 25 pounds a metre
9172807 there has been significant investment by harris tweed companies in recent years this points to an industry which already knows it must do all it can to compete in the global textiles market
9172808 design must seduce shape and more importantly evoke an emotional response
9172809 wed also note that retirees would fare quite a bit less well than working families under obamas tax plan the tpc estimates that 32 percent of households with a person over age 65 would see a tax increase
9172810 i feel like im almost more part of a conversation than i am a tastemaker and thats the way i like it

9172817 e la prima volta che accetto di girare un film non scritto da me ero molto impaurito dopo aver letto la sceneggiatura di petraglia e ancora di pi dopo aver letto il libro di melania mazzucco la violenza del romanzo in alcuni punti va ben oltre quello che poi abbiamo portato sullo schermo
9172818 lattrazione per questa storia nata da un fatto di cronaca mi ha al tempo stesso costretto a lasciarmi andare durante la lavorazione del film dice ancora il regista italo turco e rielaborare insieme a petraglia alcuni aspetti della sceneggiatura dagli ambienti alla reinvenzione di alcuni personaggi mantenendo comunque costante quellindelebile senso di violenza passione e tragedia nellintero corso del racconto
9172819 ho fatto questo film perch nessun altro attore ha accettato la parte rivela scherzosamente valerio mastandrea e ho provato ad estraniarmi dal contesto per non rischiare di essere risucchiato in maniera cosciente dalla natura del personaggio non credo lavrei mai interpretato se avessi avuto dei figli non ce lavrei fatta durante le riprese ferzan tentava di convincermi a non giudicare questuomo ma non potevo farne a meno alla fine per rivedendo il film ho capito come pur affrontando il percorso su binari paralleli insieme al regista siamo arrivati alla stessa conclusione stavamo parlando della razza umana la cosa pi affascinante e terribile che si possa raccontare
9172820 c sempre del pudore nel percorso individuale di unattrice nel cercare di interpretare situazioni al limite come questa
9172821 ero innamorata del romanzo speravo se ne facesse un film quando ho saputo che si era aperto il cast ho fatto una cosa che non mi era mai capitata prima ho mandato un sms a ferzan ozpetek che ovviamente non mi ha risposto
9172822 una delle scene a cui sono pi affezionato proprio la camminata notturna in via giulia a roma di isabella e monica dice ozpetek abbiamo tolto alcune battute al personaggio della guerritore perch volevo fossero semplicemente i suoi occhi a parlare

9172852 i think there are a lot of trends and it just depends on the childs style my daughter for instance will only wear black white or red because im assuming youre not cool otherwise i just dont know skinny jeans i would say the skate trend is always huge especially in high school urban is big

9172870 there is no let up in the flood situation it has spread to new areas and the water is not receding but relief and rescue operations are going on in a big way
9172871 we cannot say that the situation is improving it will take some more days the situation remained grim
9172872 the government is doing everything with the available resources to speed up efforts of relief and rescue
9172873 people have fled in large numbers from the affected areas in the last four days all bus stands railways stations in these areas are crowded with an unending rush of people trying to get out of flooded areas
9172874 over 100 000 people are being sheltered in 102 relief camps in the areas
9172875 for the past few months the kerala water authority has been suffering huge losses on account of increased power tariff hence we asked the government to see that an increase in water charges be allowed without causing much burden to the people
9172876 the government should see that while sanction is given it should be seen that social justice and merit should be the key consideration
9172877 this could not have happened without the knowledge and consent of top leadership of the congress and the government the nation expects sonia gandhi and manmohan singh to break their silence on this unprecedented scandal
9172878 however i would like to warn congress leaders and the government that any attempt to cover up truth in this scandal as was done by the joint parliamentary committee in the bofors case will not be tolerated by people that happened in 1989 it will happen again in 2009

9172888 by working with pro formance to conduct validation testing ford is proving that eco driving techniques are teachable and work across a broad spectrum of vehicles and drivers
9172889 its a great initiative for ford to lead in this country its not the end all solution for america to obtain energy independence but it is an important part of it
9172890 we are talking with fleet owners first because they have large numbers of vehicles and drivers that could realize significant benefit from such training
9172891 ultimately all drivers can benefit from practicing eco driving and one day it may be considered mandatory as part of all new drivers training
9172892 improving fuel economy requires commitment from all stakeholders including automakers regulators fuel producers and consumers ford will continue to do its part to improve fuel economy with new technologies across its vehicle lineup
9172893 as part of our fuel efficiency strategy we strongly encourage our customers to put eco driving tips into practice
9172894 the difference that the n85s am oled screen makes compared to earlier nsereis devices is immediately apparent when you switch on the device the screen is brighter and the colours sharper but what really stood out for me was the accuracy of the darker colours on the am oled screen black really is black this is because there is no backlight as there is for lcd screens to cause light leakage the n85 has the best screen i have seen on a small mobile device and unquestionably sets a new standard for the nseries

9172921 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
9172922 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce
9172923 che ciascuno di noi libero di vivere come vuole ma che abbiamo anche lobbligo di trattaci lun laltro con dignit e rispetto
9172924 in quando commander in chief non esiter mai a difendere questa nazione ma invier le truppe solo con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno a fornir loro quanto necessario durante la battaglia e le cure e i benefici che meritano una volta tornati a casa

9172926 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9172927 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9172928 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9172929 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9172930 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9172931 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9172932 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9172936 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9172937 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9172938 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9172939 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9172940 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9172941 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9172942 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese

9172945 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9172946 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9172947 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9172948 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9172949 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9172950 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9172951 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9172952 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9172953 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9172954 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9172955 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9172956 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9172957 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9172958 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9172959 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9172960 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9172961 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9172964 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

9173098 hay que coger r pidamente el tono en la liga
9173099 no tiene nada que perder juega en casa y seguro que pondr las cosas dif ciles
9173100 hay que salir ah y ser ambiciosos agresivos intensos jugar bien y llevarnos los tres puntos
9173101 no importa el rival no importa el campo no importa el rbitro cuando no ganemos un partido ser porque nosotros no habremos estado acertados ma ana ni gamos ni perdemos la liga pero hay que empezar bien
9173102 yo estar aqu sentado hasta que los que manden decidan otra cosa
9173103 s que el bar a se ha gastado dinero y que ha recuperado mucho tambi n en las ventas hay temporadas que se gasta m s y otras menos pero la funci n del entrenador siempre es la misma hacer que el equipo juegue bien y que gane yo estar aqu sentado hasta que los que manden decidan otra cosa
9173104 leo ha vuelto de pek n sin lesi n que es un gran noticia para nosotros con la medalla de oro y feliz
9173105 as tiene que ser eso ya se aparca hasta cuando toque tenemos que centrarnos en la liga s que todo el mundo decimos lo mismo pero cuesta reengancharnos viene el m laga un equipo que tendr hambre de volver a primera divisi n jugadores y t cnico y no va a ser f cil
9173106 el compromiso liguero es tan importante como el partido del otro d a si queremos algo bueno en la liga hay que hacerlo desde la jornada uno y no dejarlo para el final pelearnos en marzo o abril no de una vez hay que empezar con el pie derecho bien en casa aprovechar esta comuni n con la grada y a pegar primero
9173107 es normal que cuando la cosa rueda bien todo el mundo me incluyo yo nos relajamos bajamos un poquito el pist n y todo son alabanzas y viene el m laga que llega con los cuchillos afilados porque viene de segunda quiere hacernos sufrir y es labor m a con el grupo de entender que es un partido tan importante como ante el schalke el madrid o el barcelona cuando estemos en mayo sufriendo por ara ar esos puntitos para ver en qu lugar quedamos
9173108 es muy importante la labor de hablar mucho de centrarnos de internar aislarnos de todo lo bonito que es la familia los amigos y la afici n que nos ha alabado muchos estos d as bien recibidas merecidas inclusive me refiero a los jugadores pero ya estamos en faena porque si vamos de rositas podemos darnos un buen susto en la jornada uno tirar todo por la borda no cuesta nada
9173109 si viene alguna sorpresita al final pues bienvenida pero hoy me hago a la idea de que est cerrado el plantel no podemos cometer locuras ni fichar por agradar a alguien o desagradar a alguien aqu hay que ser inteligentes y sensatos el atl tico si lo analizas lleva un par de a os que no espera a las ltimas horas para fichar y en diciembre hace lo justo y ha caminado es lento pero ha caminado las prisas no son buenas consejeras
9173110 traer uno m s para agradar y no me hace diferencia no es distinto a lo que tengo pues en vez de ser una soluci n empieza a ser un problema hoy tuve que descartar a cinco de la convocatoria y otra carita m s seria entonces empieza a ser un problema ahora que es una s per figura pero ya no quedan y si quedan hay que pagar de 40 u 80 para arriba cifras que no tenemos
9173111 es el promedio que se maneja en todos los equipos cada a o es cierto que de repente hubo a os de doce o catorce jugadores eran revoluciones en ese momento seis contrataciones para la exigencia de la temporada est n muy bien
9173112 claro que nos afecta a todos los que estamos en esta sala todos lo notamos todos tenemos el d a a d a unos m s unos menos hay que pagar el colegio los libros echarle gasolina al coche ir al supermercado a comprar y vas notando tu tarjeta de cr dito normal no es queja es una realidad pero no lo digo yo lo dicen las cifras mundiales

9173149 1 false teachers are proud they are concerned for their own popularity they are concerned for their own fame they are concerned for their own notoriety they are concerned for their own prestige theyre concerned to see themselves and hear themselves in the public eye they want large crowds as it were to bow down in great homage to them theyre characterized by pride and they will do anything to gain the ground they need to gain for the welfare of their own personal ego including any amount of compromise necessary 2 secondly false teachers are characterized by selfishness they tend to be self centered they are concerned for their own comfort they are concerned for their own popularity they are concerned for their own prosperity in the end its all about money fame and prestige and notoriety equals an increased bank account they are in it for the money and the personal material benefits that they can gain as they endeavor to feed their selfish desires 3 thirdly they are characterized by deception they usually can weave a very sophisticated web of deception in their teaching because they tend to be articulate if theyre going to be successful and they endeavor to engage other people to aid them in their deceitful enterprise which gives it the sort of fa ade of credibility 4 theyre not only proud and selfish and deceptive but fourthly theyre irreverent if theres anything that sort of dominates in my thinking about false teachers it is their irreverence they have absolutely no regard for god the fact that they would go against god that they would elevate themselves the way they do that they would pervert the truth indicates their utter irreverence they have little if any regard for god his word his truth his glory his honor 5 finally they are spiritually destructive they seek to use people they seek to abuse people they seek to lead people into error which destroys them into sin which pollutes them so as you look at false teachers with regard to the world they are proud and they seek fame and popularity with regard to themselves they are self centered selfish self aggrandizing self gratifying with regard to the nature of their ministry they are dishonest and deceptive and lack integrity with regard to god they are utterly irreverent in fact they are blasphemous and with regard to the people that they influence they are spiritually destructive so their relationship to the world their relationship to the ministry their relationship to themselves their relationship to god their relationship to their people all reflects the deviation of their hearts

9173201 two years ago here i was fastest and started from pole and was leading until about 15 laps from the end when there was a problem with the car and i retired so now i hope i can come back with the speed i had in 2006 im pretty excited
9173202 the motivation was to come back before le mans and i just managed that
9173203 i still have some issues and have to prepare myself in the right way but in the long term it will all go okay if you are a racer you are a racer you know what it takes and when you love your job and to be around people like i am with audi mechanics and engineers then you want to come back that healed my internal wounds faster than if i did not have a job that makes me happy
9173204 my aim in motorsport with audi is to prove that im very happy to drive both things le mans and dtm
9173205 i like the motivation of trying to be on top in both categories in the older days people could drive different cars now everyone has a speciality they drive formula one or rally and nothing else they lack the versatility
9173206 im driving in an era where the car is more reliable and you can race more to the edge of the cars
9173207 im extremely happy and proud to be part of the team but it also makes me try to live up to more and more the big names from le mans jacky ickx and your derek bell
9173208 some people tried more than 30 times to beat it
9173209 ive been on the front row a few times but my season has been quite bad so far
9173210 ive not had the luck in the races although ive been fast many times im coming to brands hatch taking every race at a time and trying to do my best but in the championship i have a low priority and this i understand but i still want to win a race
9173211 dtm has the most exciting most powerful touring cars that have been built
9173212 the cars look like normal audis or mercedes that you have on the street but they are built like racing cars in carbon fibre the lap times are very fast the fastest touring cars in the world and theyre really exciting races this is the thing about the dtm it is highly technologically advanced this creates lots of stability especially in the faster corners where the cars are glued to the ground
9173213 going to brands hatch it feels a little like somebody put you inside the tumble dryer on maximum speed
9173214 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9173215 its important i tell people in this country that we along with every other country in the world face a unique set of circumstances where youve got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices
9173216 take action to help the economy and to help people get through this difficult time
9173217 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9173218 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9173219 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9173220 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9173221 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9173222 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression
9173223 these are the same difficult economic circumstances that every other country in the world is having to deal with
9173224 i was so tired first thing though i put so much into the first two days but then woke up around 2am wide awake
9173225 i got back to sleep about 5 30 and then woke up again at six but i played nicely and im in a good position now
9173226 weve seen 25 airlines go under this year and well see another 25 before december
9173227 the really worrying thing for passengers is that the summer is when airlines really make money and zoom hasnt even made it to september
9173228 the really tough period for airlines will be the next six months when people dont go on holiday every airline is worried about this
9173229 although we will miss scholes for the first champions league game michael carrick will hopefully be fit by that time
9173230 james marshall who created more than 75 books for children died on october 13 1992 nearly 16 years ago at the age of 50 his passing left a hole in the hearts of those who knew him and worked with him as well as his innumerable fans this september houghton mifflin is reissuing all 35 of marshalls beloved george and martha stories in one omnibus edition several authors and artists were invited to write appreciations for the book and we include a selection of them here
9173231 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
9173232 as weve seen in recent months the stock market can be a tough place to play
9173233 sooner or later every sector every country and every region takes its lumps
9173234 essentially swaps are contractual agreements for an exchange of returns between two financial institutions
9173235 so to bet against the index the fund enters a swap agreement with a counterparty usually an investment bank or hedge fund that agrees to pay it 1 for every 1 the msci eafe falls
9173236 but given current market conditions these inverse funds have enjoyed increasing popularity
9173237 etfs such as efz paired with long oriented strategies can enhance returns by lowering the portfolios correlation with broader markets
9173238 done correctly such a strategy can reduce the overall risk of the portfolio and deliver higher risk adjusted returns
9173239 the majority of bear funds tend to hibernate during bull markets
9173240 the category suffered an average loss of 7 7 annually over the last five years according to morningstar and some losses have been potentially devastating
9173241 efz and its ilk have a role in a portfolio
9173242 but most investors should remember the risk involved and keep their allocation small

9173281 ich konnte wegen meiner verletzung nicht so viele runden fahren wie ich wollte
9173282 aber es ist alles okay wir hatten einige probleme am nachmittag konnten die qualifyingreifen zuvor nicht testen aber ich bin sehr gl cklich auf der pole zu stehen
9173283 bei diesem wetter sollte man am strand und nicht an der rennstrecke sein aber es ist besser als regen wir haben gute arbeit geleistet und sind immer besser geworden meine rundenzeit war nicht so schlecht und platz 2 ist ein guter startplatz
9173284 aber wir haben gen gend daten um im rennen schneller zu sein
9173285 wir hatten hier weniger probleme als in br nn und laguna seca michelin ist viel konkurrenzf higer

9173288 in der dtm darf man nie etwas voraussagen kann viel passieren gerade hier wo die strecke so kurz ist in brands hatch geht es um hundert und tausendstel
9173289 nach der rotphase und den gelben flaggen war es nicht einfach sich zu konzentrieren und da alle fahrzeuge in der zweiten session fahren durften war es schwer eine freie runde zu finden
9173290 morgen habe ich die beste position um das beste daraus zu machen im rennen werden wir irgendwann wieder auf das feld auflaufen das ist in brands hatch blich mache mir jetzt keine gedanken wenn autos vor mir sind werde ich sie einfach berholen
9173291 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane

9173327 on a still morning in late september in a lull between cold fronts loonie and i pedalled with our boards to the point where the waves were small and clean and the cold water was as clear as the sky we sat inside at the mellow edge of the rip and paddled into waist high rollers that carried us hooting and howling in to the beach we had the place to ourselves the sandbanks rippled underfoot schools of herring swerved and morphed as one in the channel and across in the bay the breaths of breaching dolphins hung in the air i will always remember my first wave that morning the smells of paraffin wax and brine and peppy scrub the way the swell rose beneath me like a body drawing in air how the wave drew me forward and i sprang to my feet skating with the wind of momentum in my ears i leant across the wall of the upstanding water and the board came with me as though it was part of my body and mind the blur of spray the billion shards of light i remember the solitary watching figure on the beach and the flash of loonies smile as i flew by i was intoxicated and though ive lived to be an old man with my own share of happiness for all the mess i made i still judge every joyous moment every victory and revelation against those few seconds of living

9173330 i didnt exactly pull myself together i got past such notions but bits of me did come around again as flies or memories or subatomic particles will for reasons of their own bit by bit i congregated i suppose you could say and then somehow i cohered i went on and had another life or went ahead and made the best of the old one

9173407 thunderbolt is a new racetrack for everybody claims kuno and we will use every minute of the practice sessions to learn the track and find the proper setup for the cars since nick is not involved in the championship because of his mechanical mishaps he will help us reach the best setup
9173408 we were a tad short on power adds nick compared to last year some cars were so fast on the backstretch that we couldnt pass them
9173409 i was starting from first row of the 40 car grid follows kuno but some guy made a desperate move from three rows behind and thought he would get away with it he collected me and another car and our day was done

9173415 kimi is motivated and we must work hard to help him qualify higher especially on all these new circuits that i do not like and that are bad for f1 you cannot overtake and nine times out of ten the winner is he who gets pole
9173416 ill be disappointed if we dont because our performances have been fantastic especially in one day cricket
9173417 we beat the west indies 5 0 and weve come here and won convincingly today
9173418 weve got a fantastic squad weve got so much talent around australia and it doesnt matter who we play every time we walk out to play for australia we expect to win
9173419 it changes every day for our boys they can be wonderful with that minimal footwork and shot playing but they can also be ordinary
9173420 the people back home have built up this series a lot and the players felt that a bit today it looked like they werent up to it mentally
9173421 he didnt say too much hes a humble sort of guy but just his presence in his room everyone went up to shake his hand and it was good to see him in the sheds before everyone ran out
9173422 bedsy was obviously a factor in the game but weve done it for ourselves first and foremost it was the last home game of the year so youre expected to rip in as much as you can
9173423 its right up there with anything for me in terms of the circumstances
9173424 there was a lot of pressure on us to stay in the finals race and get the job done the boys had to handle the fact that our captain and inspirational leader retired last weekend we had disruptions with illness to a couple of our players and they just handled the lot of it not to mention a terrific footy team in melbourne

9173434 as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation
9173435 if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring him to the football club
9173436 theyll be a lot of people alluding to the fact weve got carried away with ourselves but i can absolutely guarantee that im here for the long term building the football club
9173437 and we are going to have to get braver in some of the things we do but it will never be at the cost of threatening the security and financial ability of the club long term

9173456 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9173457 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states
9173458 bleeding his last base the horny white male voters wait was she chosen to be his vp or to jump out of his birthday cake
9173459 really the only way i think this helps the ticket is that the mccain campaign can now feign outrage over alleged sexist remarks at the same time they are on the fainting couches decrying some mythical slight to mccains honor

9173461 if walter cronkite could manage to talk semi intelligently for hours on end during an apollo countdown in which literally absolutely nothing was happening why cant todays talking heads find something semi intelligent to say while they cover political conventions for hours on end it is a mystery
9173462 to mccain apparently talk of unity is wimpy weakness to mccain strength comes from division to mccain america cant be strong with people from other countries we can only be strong against them mccains notion of americas strength and purpose seems to be a paraphrase of president eisenhowers notion of civil religion our government makes no sense unless it is founded in a deeply felt opposition to an enemy and i dont care what it is

9173486 todays homeland security debates all too often forget the basic fact that local first responders are the first line of homeland security
9173487 the feds have quietly debated whether they should have moved federal troops in to restore order and a battle has quietly simmered within the department of homeland security over when the feds ought to push state and local officials out of the way we might eventually have to sort that out on the fly in the middle of some future catastrophe and it remains an uneasy unanswered question

9173600 wir alle sollten auf die historische nominierung von gouverneurin sarah palin stolz sein und ich gratuliere ihr und senator mccain dazu deren politik w rde amerika zwar in die falsche richtung steuern aber gouverneurin palin wird eine wichtige neue stimme in die debatte einf hren
9173601 john mccain hat die fr here b rgermeisterin einer ortschaft mit 9 000 einwohnern die null erfahrung in der au enpolitik hat nur einen herzschlag von der pr sidentschaft entfernt gesetzt

9173612 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9173613 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9173614 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9173615 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9173616 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9173617 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9173618 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9173619 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9173620 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9173621 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9173622 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9173623 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9173624 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9173625 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9173626 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9173627 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9173628 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9173629 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9173630 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9173631 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9173632 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9173633 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9173634 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9173635 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9173636 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9173637 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9173638 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9173639 they have to be honest and realistic with their methods of raising that money
9173640 you cant tell someone their house is worth 260 000 when they know its worth 110 000 and make them feel better

9173643 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9173644 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9173645 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9173646 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9173647 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9173648 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9173649 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9173650 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9173651 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9173652 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9173653 who are open to doing something on the production side
9173654 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9173655 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9173656 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9173657 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9173658 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9173659 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9173660 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9173661 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9173662 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9173663 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9173664 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9173665 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9173666 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9173667 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9173668 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9173669 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9173670 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9173671 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9173672 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9173673 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9173674 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9173675 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9173676 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9173677 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9173678 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9173679 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it

9173698 so were going to hold off starting for a while
9173699 were pretty envious that new zealand is surrounded by the ocean
9173700 this is the house i want to spend the rest of my life in
9173701 i got tingles in my body all over the place because i just met nick jonas
9173702 even my girlfriends who werent into it we made them dress up
9173703 we have to teach people to like the jonas brothers
9173704 we brought four people from the grass all the way to the front row tonight so theyre pretty excited
9173705 one of them is wearing the shirt the girl was going to wear tonight
9173706 heavenly father we just pray that youll bless us this time let it be fun and safe and exciting
9173707 thank you for all the people that are here we were at 60 percent just a week ago and it looks full lord we just pray that every person will be encouraged in jesus name
9173708 basically one girl affects another affects another and it becomes a domino effect building up to that level of hysteria
9173709 we grew up in church playing with our father onstage
9173710 wed have friends over and wed be listening to the new backstreet boys cd and hed talk about how amazing max martin was
9173711 she said he needs a manager because my son did this and he can do this
9173712 i thought im a novice and i dont want to make any mistakes that could be detrimental to us as a family or their careers down the road we weighed everything sometimes theyd throw a script at us that was full of language not suitable for a seven year old
9173713 people always used to imply are you concerned about having your kids in this business
9173714 but theyre doing les miz la boh me beautiful works of art
9173715 dear god people take your words and try to twist them around i know you cant be happy with whats going down
9173716 we went swimming and he took his shirt off and i freaked
9173717 i didnt know if wed be able to continue as a band
9173718 theres grief because hes lost his health theres guilt what did i do to my child youre uneducated about what it is once i understood i could release that
9173719 after about the second day in the hospital i realized that itd be all right
9173720 it would just take time and understanding to manage it
9173721 it had a dent in it and wed flip the seats around and call it
9173722 the amazing thing about this plane it has cameras all over
9173723 it was seriously the most horrible little rock club in the world it fit maybe 50 people when we got there the guy said there was a heavy metal band the night before that blew out the pa system so theyd have to take the monitors and spin them around
9173724 it was like when you perform in third grade or your little sister has a ballet
9173725 he puts down his chicken finger and does a slow clap
9173726 like it could be crazy but it wasnt there yet
9173727 im really inspired by mick jagger and freddie mercury the big frontmen
9173728 i heard jagger does an hour on a treadmill before every show
9173729 we could call it jonas brothers pay tribute to the man in black
9173730 when i was young i wanted to know what my favorite bands were up to all the time and its funny when theres a rumor its funny when you find out there are other celebrities with crushes on you like when i read that lauren conrad from the hills liked me
9173731 i was honored but i was like reggie bush would kill me
9173732 there was a point in our lives when we were very close
9173733 we were neighbors when we were on tour together it was good just really close but it would crack me up i would read these stories online people saying things that were completely untrue
9173734 people dont think they have much buying power but they do
9173735 its like no we named our band jonas brothers just for fun
9173736 im obviously fine now but when you learn about your diabetes theres a thing called the honeymoon period
9173737 thats the time after youre diagnosed and your blood sugar is a little all over the place
9173738 once you find a pattern with diabetes you can have normalcy
9173739 i cant tell you how frustrating it is to hear people belittle diabetes because its maintainable
9173740 theyve never had to sit on a bus when a pump didnt work and a second pump didnt work this was just last week and a third didnt and he had to give himself a shot when were driving down a highway everybody on our team is on full alert watching every move nick makes on that stage every single night of his life
9173741 the reason given to us was the indicators were not there
9173742 its just like a random place to go on vacation
9173743 it doesnt even feel real i get in a golf cart go straight to the course theyre like hey mr jonas you going to play today its the best thing ever
9173744 they are the new music business work hard touch your fans
9173745 we know a band that used to count the number in their meet and greets if it was 50 and there were 51 people there they wouldnt meet that 51st kid
9173746 you got 300 people in the lobby of your hotel thats not a problem
9173747 thats a blessing dont go through the back door go through the front
9173748 the dads make jokes like keep your hands off my daughter
9173749 to us the rings are a constant reminder to live a life of values its about being a gentleman treating people with respect and being the best guys we can be
9173750 we all did it at one point in our life
9173751 but i kind of cringe every time i read references to them being a christian band for the simple reason that they dont sing christian music probably because of my background the boys get lumped into the christian music genre but it isnt their genre
9173752 there are no guarantees when it comes to artists aging and behavior that changes with aging the key is to put it into perspective
9173753 i think weve always tried to live our lives to some standards
9173754 the good thing is that we have each other on the road joe and i share a room so well have conversations where were in our beds and talk until 2 00 in the morning we just have that relationship where were really able to talk about anything
9173755 i had an ex boyfriend who was a total metalhead
9173756 nauseated she chokes on her own vomit emitted from her distended and desiccated throat
9173757 i dont want kids to listen to job for a cowboy
9173758 but there is a certain uniqueness to metal music when someone comes over to a mike and screams i cant do that i listen to pop music and im like ok i get it that doesnt fascinate me what fascinates me is metal
9173759 i think disney channel president gary marsh would kill me
9173760 maybe even write songs under different names for other artists
9173761 but we wrote our last record while we were being ped and playing for 10 people we know what its like to do it just for fun
9173762 i dont think we ever wanted to be a band that wants to be political because that starts getting hairy

9173773 wir brauchen eine starke und besonnene europ ische rolle um eine r ckkehr zu vernunft und verantwortung zu erm glichen
9173774 leider hat sich die lage in den letzten tagen durch einseitige handlungen weiter zugespitzt dazu erwarte ich am montag ein klares signal

9173795 i feel like i let the family down in kansas
9173796 we were not uncertain of how that baby died at all
9173797 there was just no questioning how this baby passed away
9173798 its like theyre representing whats in the best interests of the companies rather than the consumers
9173799 they have not stepped forward to take responsibility for the end of life management of their product the way glass metal and paper are trying to

9173801 what we would prefer to see is an increase in the infrastructure at the local level
9173802 but mother wont this be stealing work from the unionized people who have struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages between various people in the woods
9173803 but mother arent you oppressing me by ordering me to do this
9173804 but mother then shouldnt you have my brother carry the basket since hes an oppressor and should learn what its like to be oppressed
9173805 but wont i be oppressing grandma by implying that shes sick and hence unable to independently further her own selfhood
9173806 i am taking my grandmother some healthful snacks in a gesture of solidarity
9173807 you know my dear it isnt safe for a little girl to walk through these woods alone
9173808 i find your sexist remark offensive in the extreme but i will ignore it because of your traditional status as an outcast from society the stress of which has caused you to develop an alternative and yet entirely valid worldview now if youll excuse me i would prefer to be on my way
9173809 grandma i have brought you some cruelty free snacks to salute you in your role of wise and nurturing matriarch
9173810 and grandma what an enormous what a fine nose you have
9173811 naturally i could have had it fixed to help my acting career but i didnt give in to such societal pressures my child
9173812 you must request my permission before proceeding to a new level of intimacy
9173813 if i let you help me now i would be expressing a lack of confidence in my own abilities which would lead to poor self esteem and lower achievement scores on college entrance exams

9173817 certainly has the possibility of giving her an ethical black eye
9173818 it appears for the world that ms mccann and her family have decided to take off for the guys livelihood

9173829 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
9173830 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
9173831 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9173832 in the space of 10 months weve gone from a position where people generally felt we were doing ok to where were certainly not doing ok weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9173833 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9173834 well its always difficult you know you can always say what could you have done better and all the rest of it but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9173835 well thank god i didnt have to go there on millennium night
9173836 at times he seems almost too straightforward even high minded for the low cunning of political warfare
9173837 a little flat and not just because of its now required state of the union laundry list passages
9173838 the stupidity of it that somehow the idea that it is all over in northern ireland and there is no need for an envoy this of all things
9173839 its hard for me to fathom how anyone who knows anything about ireland would say this this is a signal that the u s government will detach if he obama wins the operative word is detachment
9173840 senator john mccain has selected alaska gov sarah palin to be his running mate according to us republican party sources

9173842 dr nick goodwin from the kings fund health think tank said the data should be interpreted with caution as it is collected differently in each area he also warned that the data did not take in to account existing health inequalities or the infrastructure in place before different policies were adopted by each government
9173843 mr robinson said he wanted an immediate executive meeting to deal with the issue before it becomes a matter for the courts
9173844 i dont think its involves any deep seated policy differences
9173845 im told of around 150 changes many involve references to northern ireland being changed to the north
9173846 basically once a document is passed by the executive then thats it it should be put out in that form
9173847 ultimately it could go to the courts but i think its more a case of symbolising the bad relations there are at the moment
9173848 i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on
9173849 first minister to authorise grants despite wifes outspoken comments 80 000 to gay groups within the next seven months despite his wifes controversial views on homosexuality
9173850 the coalition on sexual orientation coso contributed to the 2007 and 2008 belfast gay pride parade awarding 5 750 and 5 000 from a fund of 230 000 which was awarded by the previous direct rule administration
9173851 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
9173852 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
9173853 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
9173854 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
9173855 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
9173856 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
9173857 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
9173858 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
9173859 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
9173860 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
9173861 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
9173862 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
9173863 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
9173864 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
9173865 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
9173866 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
9173867 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
9173868 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
9173869 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
9173870 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
9173871 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

9173909 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
9173910 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
9173911 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
9173912 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
9173913 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
9173914 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
9173915 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
9173916 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
9173917 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
9173918 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
9173919 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
9173920 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
9173921 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
9173922 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
9173923 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
9173924 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
9173925 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
9173926 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
9173927 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
9173928 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages

9174050 its not the catchall approach to divorce that people thought it might be and its really dangerous for women and their children
9174051 lowered the amount of confrontation thats involved in divorce and lowered the cost of obtaining a divorce i think by and large it has helped women
9174052 theres this assumption that men and women come into divorce on equal footing and thats just not the case

9174054 i hate to even think about a law like that
9174055 while no fault sounds gender neutral in practice it enables the more powerful party in a marriage to file for divorce without legal obligations

9174074 our utilisation in the last quarter was 73 but we usually try to keep it between 78 80 if it increases beyond that it becomes uncomfortable from a customer service perspective
9174075 it is not the only driver for growth we are growing revenues by adding customers winning deals and creating reusable components that can be used in multiple projects
9174076 there is a lag effect because the manpower addition happens in the first one or two quarters and might even go to the third quarter in certain companies so the utilisation is pretty low
9174077 if companies have maximum utilisation it might be inconvenient for customers customers need some kind of buffer because there are redundancy issues and emergencies that need more hands

9174110 pero estoy encantado de hacer el trabajo sucio de recuperarle an micamente en ese caso tengo confianza de lo que somos capaces con la ayuda del grupo porque los jugadores tambi n le van a apoyar y va a estar como siempre lo vamos a conseguir estoy seguro
9174111 es una decisi n m a no del club nunca el club ha dado una opini n me ha dejado la decisi n para m en las dos ltimas semanas son decisiones m as llevarle o no

9174115 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9174116 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov
9174117 tells the story of how they tried to sell their internet based wepisodes to big companies but maybe
9174118 you acknowledge and agree that facebook may at any time in its sole discretion without liability with or
9174119 there are violations that both nicole and madeleine are worried about
9174120 they are matters that i dont believe would rise to the level they would prosecute under the current standards of the u s attorneys office but in this circumstance perhaps theyll ignore their own standards to prosecute madeleine or her daughter to get what they want
9174121 children without fathersin their lives are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime nine times more likely to drop out of school and 20 times more likely to end up in prison

9174123 la compra de voluntades y no empoderando a la gente a tomar sus propias decisiones
9174124 nos parece un atentado a la libertad la forma en que el presidente venezolano lleva adelante su pol tica de intercambio internacional
9174125 la mejor manera de enfrentar las malas influencias de corrientes caudillistas dictatoriales como la de hugo ch vez es mantener y defender en nuestros pa ses las libertades la democracia el poder de elegir como debe de ser en todo gobierno democr tico

9174127 que tambi n pueden ser democr ticos como el caso de la presidenta de chile michelle bachelet

9174132 and never the issue of religion comes up we are friends thats it the christians are normal ordinary people all human beings have a right to their own religion and beliefs
9174133 if the state government which is in alliance with the bjp cannot maintain law and order and save the lives and property of its citizens the central government should impose presidents rule and send the armed forces to stop the pogroms
9174134 killing is a heinous crime irrespective of who the victim or perpetrator is
9174135 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
9174136 ive worked for hillary clinton and i will tell you this
9174137 the selection of gov palin will energize hillary to the extreme to elect obama this woman is very serious shes driven do you think she wants another woman eclipsing her place in history i doubt it

9174143 conditions in the camp are very hard the occupants sole aim is to secure their passage to britain
9174144 you have to be very careful when entering these camps the people there mostly men have an illegal status they have no job and no home the jungle is a dangerous place and its not safe to go there
9174145 yea you gotta know your tech but e i helps manage the intersection between technology and humans

9174164 it is really exciting to see so many people turn out to welcome me ive really enjoyed the reception
9174165 everyone has been really lovely since i got back and obviously im very pleased but i dont really feel any different nothing has really changed for me
9174166 we are delighted to welcome jason as our special guest and to pay tribute to his achievements in winning both olympic gold and silver he is a great ambassador for bolton who has put bolton on the map both nationally and internationally
9174167 we hope that his triumph will inspire young people across the borough to pursue their own dreams and show them that talent combined with determination and hard work can lead to success
9174168 she has so little experience that she makes sen obama look like fdr winston churchill and julius caesar combined
9174169 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq
9174170 its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance
9174171 its a slap in the face of other republican women like kay bailey hutchison bless her heart who was forced to stumble through an interview on tv trying to make the case for palin whom she has never met
9174172 sarah palin has been governor of alaska for just a bit over 18 months alaska has a population of 683 000 though that doesnt include moose this would only make it the 17th most populous city in the united states just ahead of fort worth
9174173 endanger his country potentially leaving it in the hands of someone who simply has no business being a heartbeat away from the most powerful complicated difficult job in human history
9174174 if hes so desperate why does this move garner so much fear from the dems
9174175 mccain picks anti choice palin as vp wrong she chose life
9174176 palin under fire and unlike the crybabies obama and miss hillary she can take it
9174177 but i do admit governor palin never came under fire in the balkans or yelled god d m america in church
9174178 when the average voter sees what you are saying about her and then reads about what she has done and hears her speak well the results will not be good for you
9174179 hey folks look my vice president is an expert in foreign affairs we can deal with iraq and afghanistan
9174180 sure dont want a president that gambles on our nations future
9174181 as we got closer to the voting we made a decision to make sure that all the analysts that are on are non aligned
9174182 carville and begala are two of the best analysts around and we look forward to seeing them on cnn plenty of times in the future once the nominating process has ended
9174183 she is fun once you get to know her she is fun and a strong person
9174184 the type of person you can have a beer with

9174186 as for the dums whining that she doenst have experience running things she has five kids trust me she knows how to run things
9174187 palins first veto was used to block legislation that would have barred the state from granting benefits to gay state employees and their partners
9174188 obama held assignments on the senate committees for foreign relations environment and public works and veterans affairs through december 2006 68 in january 2007 he left the environment and public works committee and took additional assignments with health education labor and pensions and homeland security and governmental affairs 69 he also became chairman of the senates subcommittee on european affairs 70 as a member of the senate foreign relations committee obama has made official trips to eastern europe the middle east central asia and africa

9174197 when asked about palin potentially being a step removed from the white house forrest responded
9174198 his first act will be to fly over north korea and yell charlie im baaaack
9174199 should something that is not science be taught in a science class room
9174200 lotta people digging me down and not replying sucks to have to examine what you believe doesnt it
9174201 i say that god made all of the earth and the heavens and all that is within it in his own image thats right all of it thats why he bothers to stick with us
9174202 fine but funny that you still didnt address my original post i e the fact that evolution is science and creationism isnt that was your original concern was it not
9174203 this article directly addresses the scientific evidence in favor of common descent and macroevolution this article is specifically intended for those who are scientifically minded but for one reason or another have come to believe that macroevolutionary theory explains little makes few or no testable predictions is unfalsifiable or has not been scientifically demonstrated
9174204 my concern is that evolution cannot be tested and therefore isnt science
9174205 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9174206 you can teach creationism in our schools as soon as we can teach evolution in your churches
9174207 stop saying that teaching evolution isnt violating the separation of church and state as long as teaching it teaches that judaism christianity islam etc are wrong then we should stop teaching it
9174208 well dear the bible says the earth was created by god in six days your uncle thinks it took a bit longer but its marvelous either way
9174209 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9174210 i wont have religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9174211 i believe the earth is flat its a big flat pancake now try and tell me why im wrong
9174212 ms palin can you explain how a raven managed to fit the whole sun in a box the box would have to be made of really strong stuff to keep from melting so im sure it survived do you know where it could be the event in question supposedly happened in your state
9174213 its ok to let kids know that there are theories out there
9174214 ok its time for a pop quiz on koran verses children but first get out your prayer rugs and face mecca
9174215 a prayer a prayer in a public school god has no place within these walls flanders is history
9174216 lord any lord that may be listening please make mrs griffins head explode so we can skip this test
9174217 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9174218 i 100 encourage censorship of incorrect things being taught as facts to impressionable children
9174219 prove it with the scientific method and give me a call
9174220 usa scores the lowest in national average iq among the developed countries of the world at a national average score of 98
9174221 american adults in general do not understand what molecules are other than that they are really small fewer than a third can identify dna as a key to heredity only about 10 percent know what radiation is one adult american in five thinks the sun revolves around the earth an idea science had abandoned by the 17th century
9174222 young americans show weak performance with regard to the middle east and asia despite the countries almost daily presence in the news and the potential impact of current conflicts on everyone s lives only one in seven can find iraq 13 or iran 13 on a map of middle east asia on average fewer than one fifth of all young adults worldwide could identify iraq on a middle east asia map
9174223 not letting rape victims get abortions is f ed up
9174224 but i was raised as a catholic and always taught that life starts at conception
9174225 and at this point ive yet to hear a compelling argument that it does not
9174226 genetically nothing changes at birth nothing about the body of the child other than its location changes at that point
9174227 what makes a child who has been born more human than one is about to be theres exceedingly little difference between them
9174228 and if you draw the line earlier where and why
9174229 in a 2006 gubernatorial debate the soon to be governor of alaska said of evolution and creation education
9174230 teaching both along side each other is a great idea
9174231 in science a theory is a testable model of the manner of interaction of a set of natural phenomena capable of predicting future occurrences or observations of the same kind and capable of being tested through experiment or otherwise verified through empirical observation
9174232 possibly but unless im wrong creationism doesnt try to address the big bang etc it merely swipes at evolution or at least the form they try to cram into schools
9174233 look see evolution isnt perfect now look at what were offering it solves all the problems evolution cannot
9174234 maybe i didnt get the memo but whats wrong with teaching both
9174235 while running for governor of alaska palin advocated the teaching of both creationism and evolution in public schools 48 but the next day she said
9174236 well aaaalllllrrrrriiiiiggggghhhhtttt its about time we brought truth back into the classroom and displace the religion of evolution
9174237 i think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms across the country and eventually the world one third time for intelligent design one third time for flying spaghetti monsterism and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence
9174238 she didnt mean teach creationism as fact but teach the theory of creationism and that it exists
9174239 eh shes good looking enough but i dunno if its worth it to have to listen to her
9174240 and whatever happened to separation of church and state in this country
9174241 i think its a mistake to try to cloud the teachings of science with theories that frankly dont hold up to scientific inquiry
9174242 you dont teach science and fairy tales as if they were on equal footings
9174243 confused on the workings of science and the scientific method
9174244 as far as im concerned people who dwell on the theory of evolution or the theory of creationism are wasting their life why not teach both crap theories and move on
9174245 pinpointed three crucial molecular switches that when flipped completely convert a common cell in the pancreas into the more precious insulin producing ones that diabetics need to survive
9174246 its kind of an extreme makeover of a cell the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
9174247 teaching both will not eat into high school curriculum that much
9174248 besides it lets students become more open minded and see views from both sides of the story and make up their own minds
9174249 obviously the bible says the earth is no more than 6 000 old shut up most creationists accept anything their pastor tells them it only makes since sense its science that we have a problem with
9174250 dalrymple makes a good case for an age of about 4 5 billion years for the material of which the earth moon and meteorites are composed his treatment in the age of the earth has made it much more difficult to plausibly explain radiometric data on the basis of a creation of the entire solar system or the physical matter in planet earth within the last few thousand years in my opinion the defense of such a position is a losing battle
9174251 to recap most creationists believe that adaptation within a species exists but that one species does not branch off into several different species
9174252 so when we cant scientifically prove creationism we lose but when you cant scientifically prove evolution exists were still wrong
9174253 if the laws of physics arent in our favour change the rules
9174254 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9174255 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9174256 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9174257 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9174258 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9174259 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9174260 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9174261 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9174262 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9174263 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9174264 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9174265 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9174266 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9174267 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9174268 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9174269 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9174270 no one works for someone we all just work together
9174271 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9174272 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9174273 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9174274 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9174275 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9174276 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9174277 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9174278 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9174279 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9174280 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9174281 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9174282 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9174283 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9174284 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9174285 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9174286 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9174287 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9174288 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9174289 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9174290 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9174291 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9174292 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9174293 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9174294 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9174295 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9174296 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9174297 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9174298 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9174299 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9174300 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9174301 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9174302 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9174303 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9174304 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9174305 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9174306 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9174307 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9174308 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9174309 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9174310 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9174311 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9174312 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9174313 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9174314 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9174315 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9174316 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9174317 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9174318 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9174319 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9174320 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9174321 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9174322 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9174323 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9174324 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9174325 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9174326 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9174327 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9174328 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9174329 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9174330 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education

9174351 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9174352 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9174353 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9174354 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9174355 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9174356 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9174357 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9174358 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9174359 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9174360 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9174361 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9174362 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9174363 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9174364 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls

9174367 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9174368 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9174369 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9174370 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

9174373 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9174374 because of the nature of global telecommunications we are playing with a tremendous home field advantage and we need to exploit that edge
9174375 we also need to protect that edge and we need to protect those who provide it to us
9174376 there is an ongoing concern that u s intelligence agencies will gather this information without legal process there is particular sensitivity about access to financial information as well as communications and internet traffic that goes through u s switches
9174377 its no different than any other infrastructure that a country needs
9174378 are on a rampage to build out across india and china so they have alternative routes and so they dont have to route through the u s
9174379 we discovered the internet but we couldnt keep it a secret
9174380 whether its a good or a bad thing depends on where you stand
9174381 suppose the internet was entirely confined to the u s which it once was that wasnt helpful
9174382 were probably in one of those situations where things get a little bit harder
9174383 this is one of many dimensions on which well have to adjust to a reduction in american ability to dictate terms of core interests of ours
9174384 we are by comparison militarily weaker economically poorer and technologically less unique than we were then we are still a very big player but not in control

9174388 one of the delegates said this week that west virginians want to be asked for their vote and that they will vote for you but you need to ask for it my biggest disappointment during the primary was that obama did not come here
9174389 wow i want to get married in santorini because its so beautiful
9174390 cliff fletcher as promised has re modelled the blue amp white for 2008 09 but how does one re model anything while retaining the centre piece thats why fletchers insistence that hed gladly furnish sundin another one year deal with a no movement clause smacks of ownership meddling
9174391 oh well they were right i got my fingers caught in the fax machine i talked to much to the press and otherwise was a bad employee
9174392 instead fletchers public remarks about sundin more than likely reflect the infatuation of his superiors at maple leaf sports amp entertainment the leaf directors adore sundin justifiably for his comportment as much as his playing ability always aiming to uphold a sleek corporate image mlse understands how uniquely sundin has represented the company through the years undoubtedly fletcher is being encouraged to keep open the lines of communication with the long time captain and to welcome him back to the fold even if it thoroughly counters what the gm is aiming to accomplish with his restructured team thats how a franchise in a 41 year stanley cup funk does business

9174396 whenever the government enters into a contract arrangement there is a requirement to assure the price is cost effective to the government
9174397 once the analysis is complete va will go forward with the havre clinic
9174398 the havre va clinic is a big priority for me and i have directly contacted va montana about this delay they say theyre taking a second look at how they want to do the havre clinic to get the best bang for the buck for montanas veterans and taxpayers
9174399 i am frustrated that things have ground to a halt but i have assurances from montana va healthcare director joe underkofler that the va remains committed to opening a clinic in havre sooner rather than later
9174400 as a member of the senate veterans committee i will keep the vas feet to the fire and work to make sure the havre clinic doesnt get bogged down in red tape
9174401 ive made it very clear to the va that there is a tremendous need for veterans health services in havre and across the hi line
9174402 wed follow you to hell sir but you damned sure didnt go that direction
9174403 its toxic thats how i would say it people who have been there for 20 years are getting notices of 30 days
9174404 its the worst ive seen max lewis has no regard for individual employees they have no idea whats coming

9174411 you close that mental health unit you have a bunch of people with psychiatric problems that are pissed off
9174412 but when you look at the records mccain hasnt been there for veterans at the end of the day his support for veterans has been bankrupt
9174413 four months ago i was a buck sergeant in afghanistan
9174414 and i stood on the stage of the democratic national convention tonight its ridiculous
9174415 every time john mccain appears before a veterans group he makes a point of noting that he wears the bracelet of an iraq veteran who was killed
9174416 but i didnt want to serve in this era and not deploy
9174417 when i got over there it was almost more of an atrocity that we were still in afghanistan than that we were in iraq

9174448 all of the palestinians must be killed men women infants and even their beasts
9174449 annihilate the amalekites from the beginning to the end kill them and wrest them from their possessions show them no mercy kill continuously one after the other leave no child plant or tree kill their beasts from camels to donkeys
9174450 amalekites will remain as long as there are jews in every age amalekites will surface from other races to attack the jews and thus the war against them must be global
9174451 those who kill students as they recite the torah and fire missiles on the city of siderot spread terror in the hearts of men and women those who dance over blood are the amalekites and we must respond with counter hatred we must uproot any trace of humanitarianism in dealing with them so that we emerge victorious
9174452 when the residents of cities bordering settlements and jewish centres fire shells at jewish settlements with the aim of death and destruction the torah permits for shells to be fired on the sources of firing even if civilian residents are present there
9174453 if thats what happens when religious opinions urge attacks against jewish leaders such as rabin what will the situation be like when they urge attacks against palestinian leaders and the palestinian public
9174454 the ministers in the israeli government and the knesset members compete to incite against the palestinian public and dont hesitate to threaten expulsion of the palestinians who live on their land in israel and carry israeli citizenship outside of israels borders just as former deputy premier avigdor lieberman and representative evi etam did
9174455 most of the rabbis who issue tyrannical religious opinions are official employees in state institutions and receive salaries from them and the state has not held these rabbis accountable or sought to prohibit the issue of such opinions

9174458 love is at the bottom of all we may give a reason of other things but we cannot give a reason of his love god showed his wisdom power justice and holiness in our redemption by christ if you ask why he made so much ado about a worthless creature raised out of the dust of the ground at first and had now disordered himself and could be of no use to him we have an answer at hand because he loved us if you continue to ask but why did he love us we have no other answer but because he loved us for beyond the first rise of things we cannot go and the same reason is given by moses deuteronomy 7 7 8 the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you that is in short he loved you because he loved you all came from his free and undeserved mercy higher we cannot go in seeking after the causes of what is done for our salvation
9174459 if you find me short in things impute that to my love of brevity if you find me besides the truth in anything impute that to my infirmity but if you find anything here that serves to your furtherance and joy of the faith impute that to the mercy of god bestowed on you and me yours to serve you with what little i have

9174462 youre not cocky or anything its just something i guess you have things are a lot faster theres a lot more going on youre always doing something i dont really know how to explain it but theres definitely a swagger when youre from new york
9174463 its different than charlottesville you see a lot more people out at all different times its the city that never sleeps and that really holds true theres a bunch of parks and corner stores you name it im not from a place where no crimes happen or anything like that but it wasnt the worst place
9174464 he and i have had a little fun talking about that the very first high school freshman football game i ever played in was against holy cross and the very last varsity football game i played in was against holy cross high school i remember them both very well
9174465 last year we released revenues of approximately a little bit over 600 000 we were budgeted for last years operation at 497 000
9174466 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
9174467 and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities that they never had for themselves
9174468 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life
9174469 that your word is your bond that you do what you say youre going to do
9174470 that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
9174471 see thats why baracks running to end the war in iraq responsibly

9174519 feasibility demonstration of a road vehicle fueled with hydrogen enriched gasoline
9174520 a small amount of hydrogen added to the air intake of a gasoline engine would enhance the flame velocity and thus permit the engine to operate with leaner air to gasoline mixture than otherwise possible
9174521 in 1995 wagner jamal and wyszynski at the birmingham university of engineering mechanical and manufacturing demonstrated the advantages of
9174522 the use of mixtures in small quantities of hydrogen and conventional fuels offers significant reductions in exhaust emissions
9174523 hydrogen when used as a fractional additive at extreme lean engine operation yields benefits in improved combustion stability and reduced nox and hydrocarbon emissions
9174524 cee feels that the result of this test verifies that this technology is a viable source for reducing emissions and fuel consumption on large diesel engines
9174525 emissions test results indicate that a decrease of toxic emissions was realized

9174536 prime minister stephen harpers apparent plan to call a general election this coming week in defiance of the governments own legislation fixing october 2009 as the date of the next federal election has triggered a good deal of controversy this past week
9174537 a number of commentators have argued that calling an election without waiting for the house of commons to reconvene on sept 15 would violate established constitutional conventions or norms
9174538 some have even claimed that the election call would be illegal in light of the governments fixed election date legislation and suggested that the governor general michaelle jean should carefully consider whether she should accept the prime ministers request
9174539 in fact while the prime ministers election gambit may violate political commitments it is perfectly consistent with constitutional norms and practices and would not violate the fixed date election legislation
9174540 the first point to recognize is that under westminster style parliamentary systems such as our own a prime minister has virtually absolute discretion to determine the date of a general election
9174541 while the formal legal power to trigger an election rests in the hands of the governor general there is a firm constitutional requirement that she will exercise her powers only on the advice of the prime minister
9174542 thus when the prime minister asks the governor general to dissolve parliament and fix the date of the election the governor general is expected to automatically grant the request without making an independent assessment of its merits
9174543 it has been suggested that there may be exceptional circumstances in which a governor general might be justified in exercising a
9174544 there is no basis for the governor general refusing to follow his advice
9174545 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9174546 are highly capable motivated and eager to assist in the conduct of operations here in kandahar
9174547 have a real impact on the overall security picture here in kandahar province
9174548 the ramrods are looking forward to conducting counter insurgency operations
9174549 we have actually conducting operations in maywand for the last two weeks but really its been joint with not only our canadian partners but also our afghans army and afghan national police partners as well just to get to know the area
9174550 who are reluctant at best just because of the taliban presence thats been there for so long and there are probably going to be some fence sitters that are waiting to find out if we are sticking around or not
9174551 an interim measure to cover off the obvious security gap here in kandahar province
9174552 maybe that decision by the philadelphia inquirer to hold back most of the newspapers copy from its website
9174553 most rational people would find it quite acceptable if he were to be taken out and shot in the
9174554 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
9174555 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
9174556 never sing anthem at an audition unless you know it and can sing the shit out of it
9174557 they are public buildings surrounded by tents and so it is enlarged and in some cases you have 5 000 people in a school
9174558 so there are problems linked to absence of latrines absence of anything necessary i mean basic necessities are lacking and we know that the government has made some assistance but it is limited in the sense that if the people stay in these areas they will need to have more support and assistance
9174559 i think we already lost the war and im afraid there is no military solution of this situation
9174560 when i said we georgians are not winners in this conflict it does not mean russia has won
9174561 russia showed once again its real face that it preferred to be the gendarme in international relations and not to be a distinguished member of the international community that will be respected
9174562 in due course i expect there will be some new waves of mass protests here in the country
9174563 to what extent this government will be able to survive those protests remains to be seen but it is obvious there will be some internal political instability
9174564 i do not see any major breach from our side the principles we stayed for years we do not want to confront russia with its huge resources but its russia that wants to reconquer georgia so we should not defend ourselves
9174565 its not something they feel comfortable with so the path of development of this situation and whether they will apply this invasion pattern to other countries in the neighborhood would depend on how strongly the international community would pursue the line it has taken
9174566 this is a very decisive moment either russia succeeds and the west fails or west succeeds and russia fails
9174567 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9174568 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9174569 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9174570 some of the equipment of our armed forces have been announced but there are important things hidden whose effect would be shown on the day of any attack
9174571 offensives are part of the strategy of defence and if a country confines itself to its borders it has set a limit and eliminated part of its capability
9174572 were running out of water were running out of oil
9174573 im not a pessimistic guy but i would say it behooves you to know how to pitch a tent and live outside
9174574 kids really dont get out and do a lot of this stuff were sort of trapped in suburbia where video games have become the norm not many people even get out to the forest preserves in our area
9174575 and if we lost it it would be a disaster because i love to eat
9174576 the guy who was rowing the dory we asked him what happened and he said ive done this a million times i just wasnt paying attention for this rapid
9174577 so what trap is that complacency so remember pay attention pay attention
9174578 oh absolutely yeah you dont need your knees in kayaking right
9174579 were making breakfast burritos and were cooking bacon for blts for lunch
9174580 more of the communication i saw this morning was kind of little groups of people talking about other groups of people or why they were mad at so and so
9174581 i dont think thats healthy and i definitely know its not safe if we carry that onto the river
9174582 what i learned is that ive got to change from my sort of passive hippy dude leadership style to a more full on confrontational style
9174583 and i tried a little bit of that out today and it felt really good
9174584 i will finish this course at noon and by 8 30 of the next day i need to be at the put in for the lower salmon river to be with my boyfriend to do a trip there

9174586 president arroyo must answer for the mess created by this memorandum of disagreement her lack of transparency her unwillingness to do broad consultation with all stakeholders and failure to deal with moros in good faith are the root causes of the tension and war now plaguing mindanao
9174587 it is an advocacy squarely at odds with the moa while the moa sees to create a separate state for moros i cannot help but ask why is it that in other progressive countries peoples of different creeds religion and races can come together as one nation yet gmas administration answer to the peace problem is to separate muslims and christian filipinos by creating a separate state called bangsamoro juridical entity bje
9174588 while all peace loving filipinos must condemn the attacks on civilians by the milf we must strongly resist the temptation to stereotype all moros as violent or terrorists
9174589 i have decided to come to zamboanga city to attend a function at the western mindanao state university despite threats to my person due to my opposition to the moa ad
9174590 because my conscience was clear when i took the position that the moa was not in the best interest of my brother moros and it will not bring peace to mindanao
9174591 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especially at the ramadan time
9174592 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

9174643 they stood in silence staring at the money it was funny she thought in the movies it would have been ten million some ridiculous sum three hundred and seventy thousand dollars was a lot no doubt but it wasnt completely outside the realm of their experience

9174707 i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9174708 weve also said though that in the face of inflationary pressures coming from the doubling of the price of oil rising food prices which is pushing inflation up in every country in the world now that weve got to make sure that inflation doesnt take hold here in this country
9174709 our economy along with every other economy in the world is going to be slowing this year it will be difficult it will be tough
9174710 we are feeling the effects of the problems that started in the financial markets and have spread to the wider economy
9174711 we have got to show as weve done in the past that we can come through this difficult economic times make sure that people feel safer in their jobs and their mortgages and make sure also that people know that the economic plan that we have for the future is taking us out of the downturn and preparing for the upturn
9174712 now in britain we are saying as you know that inflation is low interest rates are low and we expect there to be growth
9174713 its all the more remarkable that inflation generally is low when you have as everybody acknowledges rising food prices round the world and rising oil and commodity prices
9174714 despite this international uncertainty which started from the problems in the us housing market there are grounds for believing that we will get through this
9174715 we have a strong economy its momentum will carry us through
9174716 i think the choice is becoming pretty clear between a government that is determined at all times to maintain the stability and growth of the british economy

9174723 what is unprecedented in recent times is the coming together of the unique set of circumstances where you have a profound credit crunch thats affecting every country in the world and the very high oil and rising food prices
9174724 those two things have not come together at the same time and this is what is affecting us its affecting every developed country
9174725 take action to help the economy and to help people get through this difficult time
9174726 i have got the utmost admiration for wendy and the problems she went through

9174739 for being detained with marijuana on his person in his home state of louisiana in february
9174740 the bottom line was to have a player on your team to just play nickel he would have to be special
9174741 we had to sit there and weigh him against players who could play special teams and do some other things for our team
9174742 after the live aid set there were no congratulatory hugs or smiles it was as if we were foreign from each other this would be the last time we played together in two decades
9174743 constant bickering and hostility had left the atmosphere acrid with tension we were tired of the incendiary arguments the dark depressions the bitter resentments we were tired of the 24 hour attention
9174744 we wanted the junkets at the roosevelt because of its ghostly reputation but we got so much more than we bargained for a photoshoot we prepared was wrecked and two runners say they saw the figure of a lady in the full length mirror
9174745 the final straw came when a production assistant stayed in the room earmarked for ricky and claimed to have been freezing cold on the hottest day of the year he said he woke up with someone whistling in his ear even though he was alone then heard a giggle before being pushed out of bed
9174746 it just doesnt make sense to me and to other alaskan consumers that when the price of crude oil goes up the price at the pump goes up too right away yet when the price of crude goes down the price at the pump is a lot slower to drop
9174747 just a general concern that hey prices are dropping everywhere like a rock how come theyre not dropping here
9174748 theres never an incentive to drop prices unless your competitors are dropping prices

9174752 shes going to have a long recovery dudgeon said of staples
9174753 if it hadnt been for anne the lead guide coming out of her tent with a pot and pan and making noise gudgeon said staples probably would have been killed
9174754 what they thought initially was someone having a bad dream gudgeon said
9174755 jo ann described to me that she was sitting on her sleeping bag
9174756 then this thing was right on her back the bear came through the tent she had no idea what it was she described it as ferocious it came through the tent like a whirlwind
9174757 saw the bear with its head essentially in the tent of jo ann and the tent was in a different place than where it had been staked gudgeon said
9174758 she did a very brave thing the lead guide and ran in the direction of the bear
9174759 it was just the two women standing shoulder to shoulder against the bear dudgeon said
9174760 it turned around and started making its way out of camp he said
9174761 they had been out there a week had not seen any bears at all
9174762 he is a sociable dad and just likes hanging out with his boys maybe he is also getting them in the swing of things so they can take over the business when they get older
9174763 i just read a quote from gordon ramsay if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her

9174765 id be happier if everyone was vegetarian the planet would be better off for it

9174767 former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9174768 the players are very aware of the fact that we need to get some points on the board chelsea coming at this time is a great fixture for us to lift the spirits
9174769 you know you are playing against one of the top sides in the league and that spurs you on
9174770 if you go there and try to put everyone behind the ball and defend that it is likely to end in defeat
9174771 the important thing is to go there and play attacking ambitious football
9174772 if you go there and show character and attack that is the way forward
9174773 you should treat everyone the same but sometimes you put in the better performances against the better clubs the whole team does as well as me
9174774 chelsea will definitely be a bit wary of us because weve tended to do well against them recently especially in the carling cup final last season
9174775 it was one of the most important goals of my career
9174776 i wasnt really scoring goals at the time and there was a lot said about it so the importance of the goal meant a lot to the fans club and me as well
9174777 weve not been good enough with the players weve had weve been more than capable of winning our first two games
9174778 everyone has a bad run through the season and hopefully this is it and getting a result against
9174779 ive looked at the fixtures and weve got a run of games we can get results in
9174780 its about belief you go out with the right mentality to get the result weve got players to put on a real show but weve got to earn the right to do so
9174781 we might need to be more harder to beat it will come right its not too early to get disheartened
9174782 you have to give it the academy system time to work through but the current system is being looked at
9174783 research done by the ecb has shown that out of 516 academy players at all counties since 2003 only 16 have gone on to get full professional contracts so far
9174784 when you consider seven of those are currently in the essex squad thats an amazing statistic if correct
9174785 both have had a taste of first team cricket this year but the experience of winning a trophy albeit a minor one to a lot of minds is pretty vital
9174786 on the subject of mickleburgh i was delighted to see him score 60 against leicestershire on his championship debut last week as second xi coach you look for people to come into the first team and take their opportunity
9174787 jaik did all that was asked of him in the seconds and hopefully hell get more opportunities over the closing weeks of the season
9174788 last season and this have been like chalk and cheese
9174789 we probably only had three professionals in the side over the second half of last season and however hard you try its difficult to get any momentum going as a result
9174790 this year we have won some games and thats crucial in terms of confidence and creating a feel good factor
9174791 there is no reason for us to fear anyone after some of the performances weve put in to date
9174792 if we focus on what weve done well previously it will take an exceptional display from hampshire to beat us
9174793 ah hah there is a genetic connection between autism and head size that must mean that autism is a genetic disorder
9174794 its up to the youngsters in the next two games to stick their hands up and stake a claim
9174795 ive got a dressing room that is a little bit down in confidence but well sit down and hammer home the basics again
9174796 its up to us to bring those young guys forward as quickly as we possibly can and the starting point for me is lords
9174797 that could be the starting point of a new generation for the south african one day side thats how weve got to look at it and how im trying to package it
9174798 ive been very disappointed by how england have outplayed us in all three disciplines how we havent applied the basics enough
9174799 thats my major worry and that is up to us as a coaching staff to get right i see that as a major challenge for my management team now
9174800 it was a very very special test series victory for us
9174801 we ended that part of the tour and this part has been hugely disappointing
9174802 our attack is very inexperienced in terms of one day cricket and in some key batting areas weve got a lot of younger players
9174803 we need to get them out there and expose them if i have to take a positive out of this its asked us all where we want to go as a one day unit
9174804 guys need to focus on their positions in the one day team

9174816 heres the way to look at mccain picking sarah palin as his running mate hillary clinton has been replaced by the other woman again
9174817 our vice presidential choice is more qualified to be president of the united states than barack obama listen to her story obama cant list his story like sarah palin can democrats today are not happy with their accomplices in the drive by media theyre going to attack women when they start attacking sarah palin
9174818 there is nothing barack obama could teach sarah palin but he would have all kinds of questions for her can you show me the proper and safe way to handle and fire a gun

9174825 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9174826 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and post mortems are due to be carried out later today to establish the cause of death

9174830 we continue to receive inquiries in reference to forensic evidence pertaining to the caylee anthony investigation recently returned to the sheriffs office we once again confirm that we have received and expect to continue to receive forensic results from evidence in that case from at least two forensic laboratories as we have previously stated because of the sensitivity of this ongoing criminal investigation we will stay the course and reserve our right to withhold any and all evidentiary details until such details become a matter of public record we can affirm that every piece of evidence returned on this case is being carefully reviewed by investigators assigned to the case and the orange osceola state attorneys office our primary objective in this ongoing investigation is to locate caylee anthony
9174831 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9174832 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9174833 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9174834 but i do believe there will be certain assets that as we are already looking at the picture right now well be able to recommend can be either redeployed or not deployed to the theater in the fall
9174835 were about to start ramadan month in few days and what i would like to see is the muslim countries stepping in and help the united nations the humanitarian agencies and the international ngos to help the somalis
9174836 i appeal to the international community and the muslim countries in the region and elsewhere not to forget about the basic need for food for millions of somalis
9174837 a ceasefire in somalia is conditional on the withdrawal of ethiopian troops from somalia
9174838 the somali gunmen seized another malaysian cargo ship off the coast but i have not established how many crew members were aboard and their nationalities
9174839 the cargo ship was hijacked on friday night we still dont know the owners of the ship but we believe its a malaysian bulk carrier
9174840 todays turkey is engaging africa with africa in the pursuit of mutual prosperity
9174841 what turkey gains is a 900 million strong emerging market of vast untapped potential
9174842 the geographic proximity to each other and the cultural affinity between their peoples will undoubtedly provide turkish and african businesses with an edge
9174843 the agreement debunks the myth that compromise within the somali peace process is unattainable
9174844 the real impact of a full fledged peacekeeping operation in somalia will no doubt help in garnering support as regards to setting up a government of national unity as well as federal institutions outside mogadishu
9174845 it is only likely to translate into greater support for parties not included within the peace talks and further fragmentation of the parties involved in the talks
9174846 if this agreement is put into practice on the ground the attention of every somali citizen will unquestionably focus on one thing working for stability growth and prosperity of the nation of somalia
9174847 if i had to hand out a rookie of the year award for hockey blogging for the 2006 07 nhl season one of the top contenders for the award would have to be the forechecker

9174853 the vessel attempted evasive maneuvering before being overpowered by the hijackers the coalition forces within the vicinity were alerted but were unable to prevent the hijacking as safety of the crew onboard is of priority
9174854 we must be the change we wish to see in the world
9174855 i look at this whole process as a new frontier ive never been here before its like im just a little further down the road and im checking it out im going to miss my family and friends terribly when i go but this is where i am and what are you going to do i figure if it is where i am then i should do my best to explore it and take heart that i am still here that i did get to see the sun rise this morning and right now i am with you whats so bad about this it only gets lousy when i compare that is a dead end street
9174856 in the honest belief that he needed to protect his son
9174857 it is beyond question that by acting in the way that he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences the fact is that mr brown lost his life
9174858 that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished with a significant custodial sentence
9174859 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials to the contrary both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family
9174860 countdown is a unique show with a very loyal audience and for that reason i felt that they needed someone who was part of the countdown family like jo brand

9174862 a good deal of time has been taken up mulling over my countdown conundrum
9174863 an approach to host the programme came as much as a surprise to me as to anyone else

9174922 over the last several weeks myself included weve been pressing a little bit to score runs i hope we can get this momentum and keep going its nice to be on this side of a game like this
9174923 those are probably the best 3 and 4 hitters in the league
9174924 we had good at bats they make good pitches you hit them they make bad pitches you hit them that lifts our confidence weve been fighting through some things

9175011 it wasnt looking good for point of view when the sample arrived but the bottom line is pulling the card out of the box and seeing that hdmi port brought a whole new perspective to the card the native hdmi port really gives us the ability to use the card in a htpc and the fact that it runs cooler than the leadtek option while also being 10dbs quieter makes it an excellent choice for people performance really isnt there its a little bit faster than the leadtek option for the most part but nothing to get excited about the inclusion of the hdmi port also makes it a little easier to accept the cost of the card when compared to the 9600 gso sure its not a speed demon but it was never going to be point of view have made sure the card offers a bit more value for money making it stand out from the competition there isnt a whole lot more you could ask for when you look for a graphics card under the 100 mark while i would still personally recommend spending the extra money on a 9600 gso or 9600 gt so that you could really do a bit of serious gaming the bottom line is if youre looking for something thats cheap and is just going to put a good picture on your tv then the pov 9500 gt is a hard card to pass up
9175012 for me personally its the first time in a long time that ive had a package like this with the sort of people we are working with that inspires you to dig deeper and go around quicker scott is doing a fantastic job every time he gets in the car the whole chemistry is working well together
9175013 we were fast at long beach and fast at st petersburg
9175014 there has been a lot of progress since then and i was confident coming in here that we had a fast car weve got a strong package and our goal is to win the next three races and snatch the championship from penske
9175015 its really tough here for us and we really didnt have the best opportunity in qualifying
9175016 i didnt take 100 percent of what the car has in it its very tough for us here the layout is not so bad here what hurts us are the bumps because of our weight we could have been a little closer but its an impressive gap to the acura
9175017 a big benefit for us was michelin bringing the new street soft tires for this year
9175018 we are a lot slower since last year so i think it says we did not use the whole potential we just need to go forward we didnt have a lot of bite under braking i was struggling to slow the car down thats not a good feeling normally i dont have a problem with that i like street circuits a lot we just have to do some work
9175019 last year we had an excellent race staring from pole and built a good gap to the other car we caught a break with the safety car and gained nearly a whole lap i dont think well get that lucky again this year
9175020 and were not as fast as we should be because of the very few laps weve done were forced to use the setup from last year last year the car was great and we hope it is just as good last year
9175021 we had an accident in the first practice and again in the race so i didnt have much experience then it rained this morning and this afternoon so i didnt get much experience in the dry the team found the right setup and that was good enough for pole position though
9175022 its good to be ahead and it shows that it is good competition between us and the ferrari teams
9175023 when you lead the championship and you start first on a track like this its not easy to overtake here hopefully it will be like this tomorrow
9175024 is a radically different frame than that of the lurid affair that the media loves to paint
9175025 although we will miss scholes for the first champions league game michael carrick will hopefully be fit by that time
9175026 it creates that little bit of spice because i am coming back to glasgow but looking at the overall group we should be okay in terms of qualifying we can progress
9175027 i thought tevez was the outstanding player on the pitch
9175028 we had the best chances throughout the match it was an open game and both teams did very well
9175029 the difference is between us and previous governments other parties is that we are taking action to help people whether it is rescuing northern rock or whether it is helping people to get back into work as they lose their jobs or tax rebates which are due at the end of next month
9175030 i think it is important that government ministers and particularly me as chancellor level with people i explained that what is happening to every country in the world ours included is that we have a credit crunch the like of which we have not seen for generations

9175033 the fact that protesters have been using canoes to deliever messages to the pipelaying ship and that protesters were preparing to swim out in wetsuits to the ship does not warrent the deployment of a warship in the bay
9175034 the gardai have their own speed boats and sub aqua division and can deal with any breaches of the law
9175035 this is a great victory for paddy hopkins and the mayo environmental group and for all the groups organisations and individuals who made submissions opposing gold mining in the area
9175036 i have opposed this mining venture from the very beginning because of its impact on the special area of conservation the holy mountain of croagh patrick and because of the possible impact on the ecosystem of the area gold mining uses poisons such as arsenic to extract gold and any mining would have been very detrimental to our tourism industry as our unspoilt environment is our greatest asset

9175038 what high paying jobs does the republican party really want for our children
9175039 the u s is cartwheeling into a self destructive catastrophic calamity and despite what everyone else says about how to solve it paul believes he knows the real truth that can save us
9175040 the one time presidential hopefuls goal to drastically reduce government and thus give us the true sense of freedom that the constitutions framers meant is oversimplified in a country of more than 300 million residents
9175041 certainly his critique of current politics is sound and well felt but the plans of this republican pol who praises robert taft in every other sentence are anything but revolutionary

9175055 i realize that when i would try to work out really fast that i would be burned out i would work out for two days and then wait a few weeks and then workout for a few days again i decided to stay focused and continuous and i started to see a major change so i think ill start to see a slow progress throughout the whole show

9175082 no matter how badly i went astray you loyal republicans followed me off the cliff like lemmings and i thank you for that when im in the dock at the hague i know youll be there with me
9175083 he said he felt his knee and that he was not fit enough to play
9175084 there is nothing you can to do about it if a player declares himself unfit you have to accept that
9175085 obviously the fact im going back to glasgow will create a bit of spice but for me this is a group we can progress from
9175086 although we will miss paul scholes in our first match against villarreal because of his red card tonight michael carrick should be fit
9175087 we should be okay in terms of qualifying for the knockout stages the team is making progress and we should be strong enough to get through
9175088 his transfer saga and the fact he was wanted by all the clubs in europe was not down to him
9175089 it was down to his performances in the end he chose to stay here so why should it turn against him
9175090 we have to be realistic when a player like that is wanted it is as well an honour for arsenal the fact that he has decided to stay is an honour as well and the fact that he made financial sacrifices is an honour again
9175091 if he made some mistakes they were pr mistakes maybe but i like it when a football player is not pr because when they are they always have the right behaviour outside and the wrong inside i prefer the reverse situation
9175092 in adebayors case he made maybe a little pr mistake but for what is really important the way he practised the way he worked the way he behaved on a daily basis it is credit to him and i think we have to be intelligent enough the fans as well to support him
9175093 yes some of them have reacted but i think the majority are behind him
9175094 who will be the winner its always difficult to predict but from what i read its 5million that is the difference and at that level 5million doesnt make a difference any more
9175095 it usually finishes on august 31st with everybody going halfway and everybody thinking they are the winner
9175096 as ive said adebayor was committed first and he kept his word he said if i have a choice i want to stay and from the outside i only read the newspaper that doesnt look to be the case with berbatov
9175097 it looks like he wants a move so you are in a different situation when a player says to you i always want to stay you are not in a situation where if he doesnt go i have a problem
9175098 we are ready to stay up all night if it is needed
9175099 this season it is at midnight on september 1 so you never know we have still a long time to go
9175100 there is always an acceleration of signings you can see that when you watch tv for a while they talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour comes a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
9175101 we are out to look if we find the right player we will do it but i believe its more interesting for us to focus on our strengths and quality rather than looking outside i know that makes headlines but it doesnt make you win games
9175102 thanks for sharing such lively genuine conversations about the work of real psychiatrists

9175115 it was a way of trying to balance the justice aspect with the fact that shes young
9175116 its human nature for society to try and pin responsibility on someone
9175117 certainly looking at the pictures its a demonstration of actions that would indicate a disregard of human life

9175147 this season they need to sign a midfield player a big leader in the middle arsene has made good signings over the years and i hope he will find somebody right for the club
9175148 they may struggle at the crucial moment in the season when they need to win the big games they have the quality and potential but lack the experience to be competitive in all of the big games

9175152 fortunately the three people remained on the sand rather than attempting to cross channel
9175153 the tide sweeps in quickly here and if they had tried to cross the water then they could have been in danger

9175307 he may not be the sperm donor but hes been an amazing dad and i love him to pieces theyve never hidden anything from me i knew from early on what the situation was the mixed race thing can get a bit confusing sometimes explaining to people but thats a small price to pay for such a great family life and this
9175308 shes had to overcome so much but shes always smiling always happy it was a shock to my parents to start with i think that sort of thing always is but very soon it became obvious how much she could do instead of how much she couldnt do and shes so loving shes funny too shes got a good sense of humor

9175333 on two occasions i have been asked pray mr babbage if you put into the machine wrong figures will the right answers come out i am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question
9175334 he was feeling uncomfortable since last evening and his condition worsened today so he was hospitalised

9175338 i played a very steady game today and as a result a number of birdies came my way my putting worked for me once again it was one of those days when i knew that no one really stands a chance to catch up with me therefore i did not feel any kind of pressure and just went out there and played a normal round by my standards
9175339 it feels great to have already won four titles this season the 2007 08 season is turning out to be one of my best ever
9175340 im very pleased with my effort since this is my best finish on the pgti so far it was a mixed day for me as i made some very long putts but missed short ones

9175343 das vorliegende pr sidialdekret legt das datum des nationalen verfassungs und beratungsreferendums fest das am 29 februar 2008 beschlossen wurde
9175344 das ist ein historischer tag denn das referendum garantiert die annahme der neuen verfassung
9175345 doch ber die demokratische gesinnung des volks von bolivien und seiner regierung kann niemals genug geschrieben werden
9175346 dieser historische kampf f r die neugr ndung von bolivien
9175347 diese neue verfassung wird nun dem volk boliviens zur abstimmung vorgelegt
9175348 wir sind gegen eine regierung die per dekrete regiert und politik macht
9175349 die aktion der regierung war ein putsch gegen die demokratie ein aufruf zum b rgerkrieg und dekretiert fast die spaltung des landes
9175350 wir sind zur bereinkunft gelangt dass wir die durchf hrung des referendums in den f nf departements verhindern wenn uns die regierung ihr illegales referendum aufzwingen will
9175351 der kampf wird offen und entschieden gef hrt und von f nf departements getragen

9175360 while we have always done some recycling generally headed up by a club or student organization this is campuswide project and includes the whole array of recyclables from plastic bottles to aluminum cans to the cardboard boxes those cans come in essentially anything which can be used again including low value items which are often not recycled will be
9175361 it requires our students to be a little more careful in sorting their trash
9175362 but we think this is a sacrifice they will gladly make given the benefits of recycling

9175365 the communal and fascist forces in our country want to divide our society on religious and on the grounds of hatred which is a heinous crime to humanity burning killings and vandalizing religious places churches orphanage houses lives and property is the handiwork of fascist forces

9175395 shes a fresh new face in a party thats dying for one the antidote to boring white men
9175396 i think were going to have to examine our tag line dangerously inexperienced
9175397 by far the biggest rivalry going on in the chess world right now
9175398 we have so much depth our bench is uncomparable sic to the other teams in the league
9175399 the whole idea was to do the totally nonsensical interview with some trash talking
9175400 im a chess professional so basically im going with whoever gives me better conditions
9175401 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9175402 our focus is really on this side of the river
9175403 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9175404 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9175405 chess goes the entire range when i go to tournaments you can pretty much guarantee that there will be at least one 10 year old but at 60 i am nowhere near the oldest either
9175406 chess really keeps your mind active and there is all kinds of evidence that if you play chess you wont come down with alzheimers so really its the worlds greatest hobby for everybody because its both cheap and it keeps you sharp
9175407 you cant really understand until you have competed the intensity of this tournament
9175408 there is just something about playing competitive chess that is quite intense and there is just so much adrenaline because if you slip once you know you are going to waste four hours of your time so everyone here generally does there best to stay on the top of their game

9175416 yes shes a huge change no he isnt a candidate of change
9175417 shes somebody ive been watching since her name started floating
9175418 she is wildly popular in alaska shes pro life and conservative that plays well
9175419 she is a kind of valentine to the evangelical base of the party
9175420 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as a daughter of a science teacher
9175421 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base

9175426 were dealing with adults here once again and i dont think its the citys job or the governments job to determine what we can and cannot play in our restaurant
9175427 i understand that curiosity killed the cat but knowing brought it back
9175428 firstly why if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being as we see them well defined
9175429 even if you dont know it is false material i am telling you now that it is
9175430 fast erosion which is known to give a v shaped channel whereas slow erosion in a meandering riverbed tends to have undercutting on the outer circumference of a bend but deposition on the inner circumference
9175431 remember that natural selection cannot help as this requires self replicating entities therefore it cannot explain their origin
9175432 man or even woman as the crowning achievement of some grand cosmic plan what mortal conceit
9175433 because darwin presented such unimpeachable evidence that proved that evolution was a fact
9175434 i suppose the reason we all jumped at the origin of species was because the idea of god interfered with our sexual mores
9175435 we objected to the morality because it interfered with our sexual freedom
9175436 assert that at least some of science is really about getting away with immoral acts
9175437 to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches
9175438 let every student be plainly instructed and consider well that the main end of his life and studies is to know god and jesus which is eternal life and therefore to lay christ at the bottom as the only foundation of all sound learning and knowledge
9175439 its unknown to you that every major animal phyla has been found in the cambrian layer
9175440 why i have many reasons but one of them is that it has never been observed and it has never been recreated
9175441 all attempts at creating life from non life has failed so you believe the theory that it has happened in spite of the tests
9175442 i have the tests to back my skepticism what do you have
9175443 it has for consequences racism and justifies the elimination of the weaker we do not need this unproven theory in the minds of men
9175444 upon your evolution theory which is pushed historically standing on nothing but lies and fraud and speculations which are postulated in spite of all actual imperical observations
9175445 im not talking about the educational system where i live im talking about the educational system nearly all over the world this theory is not only forced where im from its everywhere
9175446 and evolution has not been proven to be reality take it out of the public schools stop making me pay for it
9175447 moral ethical development fostering solid values your pushed unproven theory can ethically fosters nothing but hatred for other races and individual increase racism and contempt for the less well off as well as promiscuity and therefor stds
9175448 living a good and fruitful life without the need to exploit and harm others leaving fond memories to your successors
9175449 he believed in themeaninglessness of the world which darwin taugh because he said
9175450 evolution unleashed books such as the kinsey report which is absolute moral sexual moral depravity
9175451 these people who i just quoted to you arent arent merely evolutionists theyre the worlds greatest evolutionists
9175452 you can be faithful to your wife and not believe in god however there is no objective reason to be faithful if you believe in evolution all is for pure self interest and what that means is that there literally are no objective moral values i think this is one of the most drastic shortcomings of believing in atheistic evolution
9175453 on the atheistic view whatever is is right because there is no objective source of moral value theyre just the biological sociological product of evolution its complete reletivism and nihilism just as nietche saw
9175454 assert that at least some of science is really about getting away with immoral acts
9175455 the theory of evolution is not science science is geology biology or physics chemistry etc
9175456 i feel like ive wasted my time but perhaps this wasnt as much of a waste of time as i think after all some people do read this thread
9175457 exposure is the best defense to evil your apathy and lack of concern is telling
9175458 the kkk are knights which i post against and expose all the time
9175459 are you sure you want to bring this up again
9175460 evolution is a theory fully accepted not because it can be proven by biological coherent evidence but because the only alternative special creation is clearly incredible
9175461 after reading over some of the prior posts it seems obvious that the evolutionist looks at facts from a great distance away
9175462 i think i recognise this person but i cannot be sure as i will need some evidence
9175463 ah now i have the evidence before me i can confirm that i recognised the person correctly
9175464 i am convinced i can recognise that person in fact i am sure it is jesus
9175465 at a distance it can sometimes be appetising up close it is frequently laughable absurdly so
9175466 if the simplest conceivable life form has about 600 protein molecules the chance that even a single molecule could form by chance arrangement of the sequence of the amino acids in it would be between 10 450 and 10 600 depending on whose data you study
9175467 how many inches long do you suppose it is from one end of the universe to the other at least with our present astronomical knowledge can you guess it is about 10 28 that seems a small number but consider that the distance is in inches and to form one molecule the probabilities are from 10 450 to 10 600 how outrageous does the data have to get before it becomes laughable remember that the theory of evolution says that this happened not once but again and again and again to form life
9175468 it apparent to me that we are dealing not only with a ridiculous theory but with a sick theory an ignorant theory that has been hammered into the publics mind with a religious zeal
9175469 most of the believers of the theory of evolution probably really believe that the theory of evolution is an established fact but where did they acquire their knowledge from their educational establishments they learned a deception from men who have been deceived themselves
9175470 evolution has been totally vindicated by the sheer volume of evidence creationism is dead and buried along with all the other mythologies
9175471 just with matamatics evolution fails guess who gave us matamatics
9175472 the evolutionist has swallowed the big deception the nwo elite must really be proud of there ability to deceive the gullable
9175473 they know that there is a god in heaven but chose to rebel and cast there lot with lucifer
9175474 no they dont there is no evidence whatsoever for god heaven or lucifer
9175475 at some future period not very distant as measured by centuries the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace the savage races throughout the world
9175476 no rational man cognizant of the facts believes that the average negro is the equal still less the superior of the white man and if this be true it is simply incredible that when all his disabilities are removed and our prognathus relative has a fair field and no favour as well as no oppressor he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger brained and smaller jawed rival in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites
9175477 i think we must admit that the only acceptable explanation is creation i know that this is anathema to physicists as it is to me but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it
9175478 furthermore with the adoption of the evolutionary approach in non biological fields from cosmology to human affairs we are beginning to realize that biological evolution is only one aspect of evolution in general evolution in the extended sense can be defined as a directional and an essentially irreversible process occurring in time which in course gives rise to an increase of variety and an increasingly high level of organization in its believers our present knowledge indeed forces us to view that the whole of reality is evolution a single process of transformation
9175479 has now come to realize that the possibility of a cell coming into existence by chance is impossible
9175480 if it comes to a choice between believing in a creator and believing in a scientific impossibility i will believe the impossibility
9175481 the attempt to find homlogous genes except in closely related species is hopeless organs such as the eye preserve their similarity in structure but the genes responsible for the organ must have become altered during the evolutinary process
9175482 the kkk are knights which i post against and expose all the time
9175483 exposure is the best defense to evil your apathy and lack of concern is telling
9175484 sometimes i bake a cake and then i eat it
9175485 the equal opportunities environment driven from the personnel perspective became a positive disincentive for bad practice
9175486 the things that happened there are indescribable the most cruel sadistic and evil acts you could think of
9175487 they were for childrens ankles you could see that we also found a pile of about five large canes
9175488 we would try and lie still in our beds and not attract attention they came and got kids and took them away for a while rape was rife in all ages both boys and girls
9175489 i have blurry memories that still disturb me i was stripped and male staff put their hands between my legs and held my breasts
9175490 he came to the home and told paul hed teach him to swim theyd go out all day but something happened paul changed he became moody he was never the same
9175491 if you kept asking where they had gone they would get angry you kept your head down
9175492 we children of haut de la garenne have waited a long time we knew one day someone would listen
9175493 it was men and women who abused us it was dark so you would never know who it was
9175494 you were threatened with punishment if you said anything which could be a whip or anything
9175495 when all this came out it really tore me apart and brought back a hell of memories you would be sleeping then your arms would be held down most of the time it was the other kids encouraged by the staff it was all the time it was every night
9175496 after drying ourselves we were all made to stand in a line naked
9175497 if any of us flinched or tried to cover up he would hit us across our privates with his stick my escape in leap out of window
9175498 some kids you saw again and some you wouldnt we never really knew what happened to them we were told a lot of them had run off and emigrated which looking back was a bit odd we were quite often given dead arms and dead legs by the staff i remember being frog marched around the place
9175499 media reporting of the breaking child abuse and murder scandal in jersey have conspicuously omitted to mention that governor of the jersey home for boys haut de la garenne during the 1970s and 1980s was the islands current bailiff sir philip martin bailhache kgb
9175500 local residents have leaked this onto channel islands forums and threads are being closed as quick as you can find them by moderators mindful of libel laws and the fact that very little is known for sure about this horrific story to date
9175501 figures connected to jerseys establishment are among those accused of abusing children in the haut de la garenne care home the islands police chief has revealed
9175502 chief officer graham power said that because of the size of the island which has a population of around 90 000 it was
9175503 as well as people at the home he said there were allegations about outsiders who abused children living there
9175504 the smears on me are water off a ducks back
9175505 they just want a quiet life and their competency unquestioned im angrier with them than the abusers and want several prosecuted for obstructing the course of justice the police are considering charges
9175506 at assistant director level many confidential files were destroyed by mistake although there is no evidence of conspiracy
9175507 he told these poor children to keep quiet that their mother had been lonely so long they would ruin her life if they said anything
9175508 but we could have stopped so much else so much earlier
9175509 the news from jersey is horrifying ive thought of rabet all week the hierarchy does not like these inquiries theyre expensive and produce embarrassment so people shove it all under the carpet they dont want to know even when children are dying
9175510 there will be people now crawling out claiming they were always worried what cowards what bastards
9175511 what police chief will dare risk his career by hiring jcbs to search for the bodies
9175512 my family has lived here since william the conqueror but if an indigenous police officer were in charge this investigation would never have happened jersey is an oligarchy where the elite look after each other
9175513 edward paisnel the beast of jersey was the son of wealthy jersey landowners during the period 1958 1971 paisnel abducted and abused a number of children paisnel was a fan of the 15th century breton gilles de rais who murdered around 200 children the authorities discovered that paisnel had a secret satanic chamber sir peter crill obituary times online paisnel claimed he was a member of a satanic group no other members of the black magic group were ever arrested in 1971 paisnel was convicted of thirteen sex offences against young children the human beast and sent to jail paisnel the beast of jersey visited jerseys haut de la garenne orphanage dressed as father christmas during his reign of terror in the 1960s
9175514 jerseys health minister was sacked after he blew the whistle on a harsh punishment regime in a home where children as young as 11 were kept in solitary confinement

9175586 whether california faces rosy or gloomy times we must always make public safety the number one priority if our streets parks and schools arent safe from gang violence and other crimes then nothing else really matters
9175587 democratic members of the budget conference committee have approved deep cuts to public safety programs including the citizens option for public safety which provides for front line law enforcement and the juvenile justice crime prevention act while altogether eliminating several vital programs such as californias methamphetamine interdiction program and the small and rural county sheriffs grant program combined with a proposed corrections package that puts some offenders back out on the streets without supervision these cuts will significantly exacerbate the ability of law enforcement to provide essential public safety services these programs are critical in preventing our most at risk youths from joining gangs getting involved in drugs and entering a lifetime of crime
9175588 in addition to protecting important gang prevention and intervention funding this initiative prohibits bail to illegal aliens who are charged with violent or gang crimes it creates tougher punishment for gang crimes drive by shootings methamphetamine distribution and victim intimidation it helps victims who have been intimidated by gang criminals and it funds victim witness protection programs in our communities
9175589 this dangerous initiative would deepen the budget crisis by diverting billions of dollars annually from schools hospitals and violence prevention programs into the criminal justice system it is a misguided effort to incarcerate more and more people including youth
9175590 billionaire henry nicholas iii who donated millions to get two crime related initiatives on the november ballot was arraigned on june 16 2008 on an 18 page 21 count indictment that includes charges of supplying prostitutes to big ticket customers drug use and trafficking conspiracy security fraud and making death threats
9175591 we understand senator runners goal of trying to address the gang issue unfortunately this measure takes a reactionary approach and does not effectively address the root concerns of the problem the nature of which the bill was written fails to illustrate how it would actually make our neighborhoods safer however it does illustrate how to further overwhelm a prison system that is largely occupied with african american and latino males by imposing sentence enhancements and targeting these particular demographics this is especially inconsistent when our states governor has recently proposed a 22 000 prisoner early release to ease the states massive overcrowding challenges
9175592 the runner initiative directs billions of tax dollars to prisons probation and police one billion dollars in the first year and half a billion per year thereafter plus additional unfunded mandates that local and county governments will be forced to pay
9175593 the runner initiatives name on the november ballot is as misleading as what it proposes to do for our community
9175594 everyone wants safe communities bringing peace to urban america is perhaps the most difficult and profound challenge facing the country today however in this time of crisis the runner initiative is the worst kind of public policy it plays on our deepest emotions but sets us up for failure the runner initiative is an unfunded mandate that will gut californias budget it wont result in safety and security instead it will leave us in more debt with less safety and stability than ever before

9175615 you have probably heard many things about the bibles legendary ark of the covenant if you know about electronic components which i did since i was a 5 year old little genius electronics freak and you read even the worldly bibles description of the ark which i hadnt you will realize that this was a giant electric capacitor a capacitor is a device usually found in an electronic circuit that stores up electricity to a certain level then releases it in a burst this is why the ark had the reputation that if you touched it or got too close to it you would get zapped by a lightning bolt from god the size of the ark as a capacitor held a charge big enough to make a bolt that would easily kill anyone who got near it and would kill many people
9175616 when i was a child i opened the back of our tv there was a label on one area that said warning high voltage do not touch to me it was an invitation so what did i do i touched it and i got a shock that sent me flying across the room and slammed into a wall i later found out it was a capacitor and it was only about the size of a salt shaker so i can imagine what a huge thing like the ark would put out they probably should have called it the arc instead you know like an electric arc
9175617 yes anyway only david in his humility was able to touch the ark without being killed
9175618 because of his advanced spiritual development his energy centers his chakras were prepared to deal with such power and the frequency of the electricity and of course with the guidance of the hierarchy and his destiny the raw power was transformed and channeled in such a way that it only made for a kundalini experience a communing with god and instead of being killed he came out of it wiser and more powerful
9175619 but you said the ark was a power device in egypt in the great pyramid why did david have it and what was he doing with it
9175620 it was once the power storage device inside the great pyramid yes and i will get to that in a moment but first understand what we started to discuss the pyramid had a layered capstone of copper and custom created quartz crystal from atlantis the pyramid would collect energy from the earths bio field and focus it in the ark the ark would release regular bursts of a specific frequency of electrical energy that would be transmuted and transmitted from the crystal capstone all the childrens buildings and vehicles had receiver crystals tuned to the pyramid and would pick up and change the energy back into usable power we are still using this here today now as for your question about how david came into possession of it read the texts to get the entire story but basically during what they called the exodus when moses freed the jews in egypt the jews went on a sort of freedom celebration rampage as they left and took all kinds of egyptian treasures taking everything they could on their way out of town this which has been omitted greatly in the worlds modern bible was one of the primary things which incited the pharaoh to pursue them and one of the things they took from egypt from the great pyramid was
9175621 yes then of course over time knowledge of its original use was lost they did not understand its power and attributed it to a power of god which was quite logical to them it would strike people down who got near or touched it and this was easily interpreted by some that it must be some sort of temple god lived in and only the holiest of people were allowed to get so close to god and in it they eventually put the pieces of the commandments moses brought them that he smashed in his righteous indignation and despair over their unconsciousness and selfishness
9175622 we have a version of one the capacitors here as you know but the one from the great pyramid is located in a small church in ethiopia
9175623 yes i know it sounds odd but there is a good reason it was brought there by a small contingent of jewish priests because they held it in very high regard as a holy religious item and were concerned about it being desecrated or destroyed during an impending invasion
9175624 it is a long story but basically it is because of bonds that had been formed there by the coming together of solomon and the queen of sheba who was the ruler of what is now called ethiopia just read about it in the texts when you have time
9175625 i always hear references to life being an illusion or what we are perceiving is actually an illusion does that have to do with our limited senses
9175626 life being an illusion is more a question i think ill let you save for zain but i can answer you about sensory perception illusion in part because of the limitations of our senses much of what we perceive is an illusion a table for instance is not what it seems to us
9175627 in moments of higher consciousness i have seen what looks like a crawling or vibration in wood or stone is that what you mean
9175628 it is part of what i mean you may be seeing the life of the molecules of the object or the auric vibrations but i would need to know more specifics of your perceptions which well discuss later perhaps to give you an easier to understand example of obvious illusions consider the modern invention of television and the picture you see on it the pictures we see are not pictures at all but many individual lines of parts of the picture flashing at us one at a time they start at the top or bottom of the screen and go to the other end but these lines appear faster than our human perception can process so we dont see them as individual lines being flashed one at a time instead the many lines seem to be there all the time making whole pictures movies are similar as many as 30 still pictures are being flashed in one second we see it as a seamless presentation and have the illusion that the people and things on the screen are moving but they arent certain animals with better perceptions just see the lines on a tv or the still pictures flashing during a movie that is just one of many examples but there are even more far reaching illusions about life and the world around us even the tv set is not really what it seems to us the true reality beyond our perceptions even the most solid physical objects are but atoms and the parts energy they are composed of vibrating at various rates in various arrangements these vibratory rates and arrangements of atoms are perceived by us through one or more of the very limited 5 senses of an earthly human body we then process this sensory information and in our limited consciousness perceive these atom groups as the things that make up the world we live in the things that are all around us tvs cars carpets skin air you name it what we think all these things are is the result of the warped assumptions our brain makes the assumption being based on the very limited data we get from our senses about a certain arrangement and frequency of vibration of atoms and atoms are just a building block of the same one thing the stuff of the universe thus everything we think we see is really just an illusion not its true form just a conceptual form created by our brain we put together an image or idea of what we think were perceiving by virtue of our programming expectations experiences etc manipulating the bits of information we get from our highly limited senses when you see the movement or vibration in a solid object like you were just talking about whatever it is you are seeing is because your consciousness is expanding beyond its limitations and you are glimpsing a bit more of reality
9175629 so our consciousness and our limited senses really create a perceptual handicap
9175630 its even worse than that peniel we are already starting with the great handicap of perceiving such a small part of the world around us then to make matters worse we process that information through the filters of our emotions and pre conceptions this all leaves us with a very inaccurate illusion of reality and just a little change in the frequency of the vibration of atoms how fast or slow they vibrate in a molecule group of atoms can completely change our perception of what it is for example we know the slower vibrating molecules of h2o as ice a solid as the frequency of vibration increases we know them as water a liquid faster still as steam faster yet as hydrogen and oxygen gas then where
9175631 looking to outer space you find countless stars suns like the star of this solar system with planets of their own in orbit constantly moving vibrating they follow the same universal laws of all as does the atom the micro cosmic solar system indeed anywhere we look in life be it outer space or inner space everything is either atoms or solar systems they are like octaves of the same thing micro macro cosms there is nothing else what is a building a tree they and anything else that seems to be something else are but an assembly of atoms solar systems i cant emphasize the significance of this enough it is one of the most important facts there is and understanding its full meaning is one of the great keys to understanding the universe and our lives
9175632 the next great key can also be seen with atoms and solar systems it is their orbital pattern their orbital relationship it is the one primary pattern that exists in the universe it pervades everything and all else is built upon it peniel it is what our human male female relationships are based on it is what makes soulmates soulmates
9175633 but arent orbits separate things amongst separate solar systems or atoms how could it be what everything in the universe is built upon and how could it be what human relationships are based on
9175634 there are a variety of reasons that can be behind the founding of a religion some are good and many are bad thus both good and bad religions have been created there are religions that started as a means for worship some to help people improve themselves spiritually or otherwise others were specifically created just to control and have power over the people but even many religions that started with good intentions degenerated over time into self serving power structures whose main function was to control people and make money
9175635 how do they control people other than by peer pressure and trying to convince someone about something with a sermon
9175636 they vary in their methods and functions most offer their members personal salvation through following the religions tenets beliefs rituals and dogma and thus they insinuate you will not find god or salvation if you dont follow their particular religion most also aim to fill an emotional or psychological need in peoples hearts and minds they generally each have their own dogma answers to spiritual questions about god who we are and the rules that we should live by some religions control by using peoples insecurity and have even been formed based on the insecurity of an ignorant society some were based on fear there is the fear of hell religion as fire insurance there is the fear of god which
9175637 i was just getting to that it is religion that basically comes from the idea of needing to worship and serve a god or some kind of powerful supreme being because you actually need to fear him if you dont because he is all powerful and has negative emotional attributes commits atrocities when angry or jealous and allows great suffering and disasters when he could easily stop them
9175638 so noah what youre saying is worshipping that kind of god is not much different than being respectful to and paying homage and taxes to an evil king or warlord of the realm because if you dont he may come burn your hut or your fields or kill you or your family rape your wife etc
9175639 thats an interesting and insightful analogy yes in fact that is precisely what many religions did and how they used the concept of god but as opposed to being just a king or a warlord people were told it was an all powerful being like a super powered evil alien from outer space bent on taking over and controlling all the people of this planet earth and of course the next step in such a religion is dealing with the abusive power of its leaders the religions leaders being self appointed representatives of such a god would even torture and burn people alive for not believing or behaving precisely as they dictated or precisely as the god they represented dictated that they live millions of people have been murdered and tortured as the result of this
9175640 lets just say for now that people throughout time and of various religions have used their particular god or even their particular name for their god as an excuse to control torture and murder thats one reason we prefer to call god the universal spirit rather than anything that personalizes or segregates the concept but there have been legitimate or sincere reasons and beginnings for religions too some have been formed based on faith or the moral ideas of the religions founder some have been based on visions or insights of a great spiritual teacher unfortunately when the founding visionary dies usually dogma and the religion take over others provide a more direct means for personal salvation within the framework of dogma
9175641 how and why was the religion of the children of the law of one started
9175642 while the children of the law of one is a spiritual way and also a monastic order i suppose you could say it is somewhat like a religion but it is not a religion in a couple of very important ways to start with none of the above reasons were behind the founding of the children nor do they play a part in what they teach there is no control not even an attempt to influence only to educate and reflect the truth to understand why the children of the law of one was created and what their foundations are we need to go back to the beginnings of human life on earth
9175643 the historical records start with the premise that there is one great being god universal spirit that is all things including the universe itself it divides multiplies within itself creating us thus our history begins with all of us humans essentially being part of and one with god the records describe us as being spiritual or angelic beings free to roam create and enjoy the universe the teachings go on to say that our beginnings on earth came in two steps a first wave and second wave of human amp semi human materialization into physical bodies on earth at the time we had the ability to instantly alter our vibration and instantly create anything we desired with a mere thought it was in this way that we thought ourselves into matter into material existence on earth which began our fall from our angelic state and oneness with god you have probably heard of mythological beings such as the minotaur centaur mermaid etc the minotaur had a bulls head and a human body the centaur a human head and torso with a horses body you may also have seen pictures of egyptian gods with animal heads and human bodies or animal bodies and human heads like the sphinx in the pacific regions ancient drawings and carvings of bird headed humans can be found on both sides of the ocean why do you think so much of this exists many legends and myths have some foundation in fact and this is no exception the ancient teachings from atlantis reveal that such creatures did indeed exist and that their origins were not what you might expect they were the fallen angelic beings from the first wave of materialization on earth
9175644 well yes and no you have a misconception of sorts that is a personalized concept from the allegory the first wave of materialization was a terrible mistake authors note this will be explained in greater detail in the history chapter the first wave beings materialized as partly human partly animal creatures this is why in the story of lucifer or the various creatures that were called devils or demons or whatever appear as horned cloven hoofed creatures with tails the fact is they were part goat this is why goats have become associated with the devil also but evil is an entirely different matter think not that evil does not exist but true evil disguises itself and points the finger at innocents
9175645 not initially the stories you have heard have become terribly mixed up even the bible originally paints him as a great angel but there was no rebellion or defiance against the will of god until after this fall not prior to the fall as is often depicted it was just a mistake at first try telling one person in the meeting hall a story and ask him to repeat it quietly to the next and the next person to the next until it comes back to you by the time you hear your original story it will not even be recognizable that is why our teaching methods are so stringent we must keep the truth straight and consistent and this has been assured by our forbearers getting back to the primary teaching today there were more fallen angels than lucifer and they took many different part animal forms for ease of description we call the part human part animal beings that fell into physical vibration or matter during the first wave of materialization humanimals as soon as the first wave beings materialized in their humanimal bodies they suffered a great fall in vibration from their previous spiritual angelic state of existence they instantly experienced a near total loss of consciousness awareness and intelligence in less than the twinkling of an eye the consciousness that just moments before had encompassed the entire universe and experienced oneness with the universal spirit god was virtually gone the new limited consciousness of these pitiful creatures trapped them on the physical plane of the earth where they had to live in ignorance with their animal like intelligence and awareness they were suddenly isolated from universal god consciousness and trapped in the lonely anguish of separate consciousness this separate consciousness gave birth to a sort of separate free will which was ignorantly used selfishly rather than in harmony with the will of god ultimately they would also be trapped in slavery evil is spawned by selfishness but later even greater degrees of evil came about which we will discuss more later yet all selfishness and evil has since mistakenly been blamed on these poor unfortunate first waver humanimals to be sure some had horns and tails and cloven hoofs but they have been used as scape goats and diversions in order for others including regular humans to avoid taking personal responsibility for the real evil the real devil which is the selfishness living inside each human who maintains separate consciousness from the oneness of god
9175646 then why arent all of us still lost and out of touch with god
9175647 a couple of reasons some of us did not make this fall those who didnt fall were still in their angelic state and watched all this happen to the first wavers our grand master authors note later known as jesus in his last life on earth organized and led a rescue mission with their great love and compassion many of the other angelic beings who had not fallen decided to help the trapped first wavers even at great risk of the same fate they became what we call the second wavers the second wavers knew they could only help the first wavers if they too materialized in forms that would allow them to work on the lost souls the humanimal creatures in their own physical form and dimension and the grand master and various angelic volunteers knew that in order to do that it would require lowering their own vibration towards that of the physical plane and subsequently lowering their consciousness to some extent they knew this was dangerous and that they had to be very careful how they did this and be careful about how deeply they went into physical matter or they too would become trapped in limited consciousness just as the humanimals were thus the ancient atlantean teachings describe how this second wave became the first consciously controlled thought projection or materialization of modern human life on earth or at least they eventually became modern humans as they gradually solidified into the material plane from their spiritual angelic state the ape like early human form was actually just eventually chosen by second wavers as the preferred type of physical vehicle to model themselves after because it allowed for the greatest control and manipulation in the physical plane that would be required to help the first wavers that is why scientists cannot find the missing link because there simply is none because while evolutionary change certainly does exist our present existence on earth did not involve evolving for millions of years from apes
9175648 so the second wave of materialization began as a rescue operation of sorts to save the humanimal beings who fell in the first wave please tell me more about who organized this and how could they do anything about it
9175649 who we will discuss later please just let me finish relating this part of the teachings in order to accomplish this rescue as you called it two things had to be done one methods had to be devised that would help the humanimals regain their spiritual consciousness and awareness of oneness with the universal spirit and two methods had to be devised for the second wavers to maintain their spiritual consciousness and awareness of oneness with the universal spirit to both these ends second wave beings founded the spiritual path of the children of the law of one and created the methods and teachings that are still in use and valid today thus the spiritual order of the children of the law of one was founded with a very specific and unique purpose and while this order included aspects of what would later become numerous religions the children of the law of one was unlike any other religion that would ever appear on earth and remains so it was not created to fill a need in peoples hearts and minds nor to strike fear into their hearts nor to worship anyone or anything nor to answer the spiritual questions that arose in the spiritually ignorant masses nor to control those masses it was created before all those issues even existed
9175650 so the children are not really a religion in a sense
9175651 no by many modern definitions it could be considered such but again the whole point of the childrens materialization was to rescue their trapped kin by returning the first wavers to their angelic state of existence and awareness universal consciousness thus the whole point of the childrens spiritual path was to be able to enter the material plane so they could help the first wavers while maintaining their own spiritual consciousness and angelic state so they wouldnt get trapped also if i may continue as the second wave rescue mission gradually descended into materiality and human form some of them lured by selfish desires turned away from the childrens spiritual path they then lost spiritual awareness and separated from oneness with god ultimately this division created two religious or philosophical groups in atlantis with very different purposes and politics the sons of belial and the children of the law of one the sons of belial mimicked the children in many ways even in the sense of being spiritual or religious but their religious practices were mockeries of true spirituality phony empty and self serving they would use prayer and visualization to attain whatever they wanted and they turned a blind eye to what the repercussions of getting what they wanted would have on others some popular present day religions are offspring of the belialian religion and then there are the secret societies that still practice their original ways in atlantis the most significant contention between the children and the belialians was over what to do about the humanimals the humanimals were easily controlled by the powers of a second wavers mind and they could be made to do anything just through visualization since the belialians had turned away from their awareness of oneness with god in favor of selfishness they wanted to use the humanimals as pet slaves the children however still wanted to help return the humanimals to their higher state of consciousness thus the children also became activists and their goal as a group movement was still to free their trapped kin but now they also had to contend with other second wavers who had gone bad
9175652 so noah did the children win out over the belialians there arent any humanimals walking the earth any more right were they all killed or rescued
9175653 ill answer that in a moment but first let me say that even the best of the children of the law of one eventually succumbed to some degree to the separation from the universal spirit
9175654 now to answer your question while part of the childrens goal was eventually achieved the humanimals were freed from their animal entanglement after the destruction of atlantis freedom from darkness and slavery has not been fully accomplished
9175655 some spiritual traditions are so rooted in the culture they are from that people from foreign cultures or lands find them difficult to adapt to sometimes there are even language barriers and cultural customs that have become part of the religion for instance some paths require learning or chanting in japanese or east indian languages rather than translations of those languages many require performing or participating in rituals that are unique to a foreign culture even though they evolved specifically because of those cultures while some paths have legitimate reasons for such things most do not and their requirements are limiting and often nothing more than dogma and cultural bias
9175656 boy i can relate to that noah a year or so ago i entered a zen monastery in the u s for about 6 months and they did everything in japanese and in japanese style and wouldnt explain to me what the translations of the japanese chants were even still i liked a great deal of it and i definitely got something out of it but it just wasnt ultimately my right path
9175657 no it is a very good path but clearly this is yours if for no other reason than to teach me patience
9175658 i was just joking younger brother you had a good point its just that you are here for me to learn some things just as i am here for you to learn some but you are ultimately here for the world more than i but let me get on with what i was saying unlike other traditions and religions our spiritual and philosophical teachings lack any emphasis on religious dogma and have no cultural embedding the teachers are from every part of the world and the universality of the teachings and methods easily adapt to those individuals from any culture who have an open mind and are truly spiritually inclined thus it is a path that is readily accessible and useful to people from any land if they wish to take advantage of it
9175659 the beliefs and teachings that the children of the law of one had and have were not formed based on faith most of the basis of them came from atlantis and thus to us our knowledge philosophies and practices are simply gleaned from the scientific facts of universal laws that govern all things in the universe including the use of the mind and energy they are merely the result of observations of the universal forces that are involved in the practical applications of our spiritual and physical existence thus even today understanding the substance of even the ancient beliefs requires no faith but rather a certain quality of intuitive logic in fact the path urges us not to take the teachings on faith but to experience god and higher consciousness directly that way we can really know rather than just taking something on faith and hoping really bad that its true there is no more powerful way to change your life in a real and lasting way than to directly experience universal consciousness and thus experience and know oneness with the universal spirit god the teachings both give us methods to expand our awareness and directly experience god and universal consciousness while also explaining to us the effects of universal laws in simple terms even if the law itself is difficult to understand
9175660 ok for instance you may not understand the complex laws of gravity that physicists grapple with but you can understand how newtons observation of an apple falling from a tree led him to a scientific conception of what goes up must come down right
9175661 more simply still your own experience with the law of gravity has taught you about the effects it has on your life for instance you wouldnt ignore the law of gravity and walk off a 30th floor balcony yet how many people ignore even more important universal laws because they dont really understand their effects factually so the ancient atlantean teachings offer us a way to understand the effects of universal laws on our lives and thus a way to benefit from them
9175662 yes i understand you now but i want to learn more about spirituality not physics
9175663 zinuru if you have a moment could i please speak with you
9175664 a moment a moment i suppose i do yes no its gone now sorry but yes ill speak with you now anyway
9175665 can you tell me about this science magic i keep hearing about
9175666 no problem it has been said that all the teachings of the children of the law of one are based within science magic have you heard that
9175667 you think so very well well they are all based on it let me explain the history of that to our ancestors what many consider the mysteries of life were not confusing or complex but simply a matter of applying their understanding of universal laws
9175668 good then youll save me some time our atlantean ancestors easily manipulated vibration using thought within a framework of scientific facts god and spirituality were not vague concepts the universal spirit was not unknown to them or some being that was out there somewhere and magic and miracles were not just something that existed in fairy tales and religious parables from days gone by they were the scientific workings of spiritual forces on physical matter spirituality as well as materiality and physical life were all simply based on scientific facts of universal laws for instance they understood that psychic phenomenon electricity magnetism gravity light sound space time and such were all related and aspects of the same thing and all followed universal laws the barbarian cultures that lived around us or came into contact with our ancestors couldnt understand these things so they just lumped it all together as magic some mysterious something that could only be created and wielded by gods devils or witchdoctors with strange powers and rituals but what gives anything the appearance of magic if not deceptive illusions or tricks what is real magic other than creating or altering energy and matter which is comprised of energy so in a very real sense much of what we do is magic but it is based in science not superstition thus science magic is inherent in the children of the law of one s entire approach to life and religion visualization for instance works like magic you see it happening and it happens visualization is used successfully in everything from zen archery to healing and all such things have that appearance of working like magic here let me give you a little demonstration
9175669 simple visualization and energy one aspect of science magic you will learn it in time and if i had wanted to really put my mind to it you wouldnt have been able to lift me at all
9175670 thats nothing but while our ancestors achieved wondrous things with their science magical tools it is not any more mysterious to us than defecating is to the uninitiated to us this use of the mind to create physical reality is just a simple fact of universal law science and a very fundamental one this also applies to everything else in the childrens early days on earth such as their use of pyramids to provide power to vehicles and buildings without any visible connection all their understanding of god spirituality and the matters of day to day life are based in this knowing that real magic is science and real science is magic this lamp i am holding for instance it has no batteries like they use in the outside world yet it is powered by what something you cant see and you dont yet understand is it magic i guess so is it science i guess so which reminds me i have some repairs im in the middle of
9175671 oh im sorry thank you for your time and teachings zinuru
9175672 think nothing of it youre quite welcome we must have more talks and i know you want to know more about how we are using some of the ancient technology to power things here youll be able to learn them easily if you wish you have great vision and insight that few have and i welcome discourse with you
9175673 watch it youll get my ego out of hand with comments like that
9175674 i wouldnt worry about that zain will assure the last of your ego is stomped to death hes talked about you a great deal
9175675 in truth it is you will be far wiser more intelligent find peace and your place as a caring instrument of the one once all is said and done
9175676 as i was given water i now offer you water may you drink deep
9175677 regardless of whether or not you believe it your beliefs control your destiny so they need to be closely scrutinized for what they create in your life what you think and believe greatly effect whether or not you are a saint an evil monster and everything in between like a somewhat kind person or a somewhat mean person
9175678 what does it really matter what beliefs we hold i thought it didnt matter as long as people are kind caring compassionate and harmless
9175679 it is another paradox in a way it doesnt really matter what beliefs a person has as long as the beliefs they have yield those virtues of unselfish love you just mentioned but their beliefs may yield those virtues or yield harm and evil beliefs have a dominant and powerful effect on every aspect of our lives people even kill over beliefs
9175680 religious beliefs are frequently based on faith and they are most often something we are taught to believe early in life by our familys religious beliefs and religion other beliefs are absorbed also from our cultures people dont usually stop and think about the fact that something as seemingly innocuous and insubstantial as our mere beliefs really have much effect on our lives but they do in fact they not only have tremendous effects on our lives but they also control much of our destiny
9175681 how can this be that just an idea a belief controls our destiny
9175682 a belief itself is but an idea it has no real substance but we act based upon our beliefs the actions we take because of our beliefs have effects and only the effects the results of those actions are things we can see feel and grasp this is very important to realize because the effects of our actions which result from our beliefs are precisely the things that can be used to determine the value good or bad of any given belief for instance if you are kind to me because you believe we are all brothers amp sisters your kind actions are something real something we can both know is good kind actions are transcendent of language culture and whatever you or i may believe is spiritual truth likewise if you are cruel to me because of a belief i will know it is a bad belief these are obvious examples of course and the results of many beliefs may be not so clear cut nevertheless all beliefs subsequently generate their own thoughts and actions good or bad
9175683 so what should we believe for the greatest good for ourselves and the world
9175684 unselfishly loving all beings is a belief of the children of the law of one and the essence of the teachings caring about others compassion and kindness are qualities of unselfish love if these are things we can all agree are good then unselfish love can be used as a common or universal measuring stick of goodness and if unselfish love is the result of true spirituality these virtues can also be used as the measuring stick of spirituality such a measuring stick can be used to compare the manifestations of any belief and thus compare the value of any belief
9175685 so we should analyze and compare the effect of our beliefs

9175744 we have about four or five irons in the fire
9175745 two of which are pretty much well down the line three could be maybes
9175746 one of those could be maybes he trained with us this morning and certainly looks like a player who could improve us
9175747 the last player we will want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner and myself i am sure he will not be leaving st james park
9175748 sometimes you just get to a point where you sit down and say yeah its the right time to do this deal
9175749 it might not just be one player it might be two
9175750 its a win win james has got a fantastic move to a club that he knows because hes been on loan there and weve got some more money in the pot should we choose to use it in this window or the next
9175751 that although i am really disappointed to lose james milner i think we can make a plus out of this
9175752 i just want to make it absolutely clear that at the end of the day it was my decision to sell him
9175753 if you look in the past at my managerial record ive not been afraid to sell players as well as buy them
9175754 andy cole will come to mind so in the short term it looks wow why have they done that but over a period of time it might be thats why
9175755 itll be judged over a period of time wont it itll be judged on lots of things who we get in what we will do with the money in the next window if we dont get people in and people will judge it on how james does at villa and so on it will to and fro but the facts are that we have to get on with it we are a player down for tomorrow but this is a long season
9175756 ive got a great record against stephen thats three wins out of three
9175757 ive not played the top players for the last few years but ive worked harder than ive ever worked during the summer
9175758 im really looking forward to the next round theres everything to play for its a semi final next but it would be fantastic if i could get to a final
9175759 i came to belfast with a new cue and didnt know what to expect
9175760 my last two matches have been poor so i didnt go into the match with any confidence but from the very first ball you sometimes know your form is
9175761 my confidence flowed that was one of my best match performances for a very long time
9175762 if i keep my form going its going to take someone to play well to beat me
9175763 i was a no show today ive played dave three times and never given him a game its disappointing
9175764 he played better than me but in the first six frames i was in and amongst the balls its back to the drawing board
9175765 it was stop start stop start it was hard to get any rhythm going im just pleased to have got over the winning line
9175766 i feel good but feeling good and playing good is a totally different ball game
9175767 we had boarded the flight and sat for an hour and a half
9175768 we then had to disembark the pilot was left to tell all the passengers there would no longer be a flight and the reasons why
9175769 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
9175770 the other airlines are quoting 2 500 and we just cant do it
9175771 we appreciate that airlines go bust but what i object to is that baa would have known about this and didnt let us know
9175772 the closure of zoom does seem a little ahead of schedule especially as oil prices have been falling recently

9175775 i only saw him on the weekends and i didnt want him to come home to this woman who couldnt do anything
9175776 i completely masked it and completely kept myself somewhat pain free and with the ability to function and do everything he wanted
9175777 she told me many times that she wanted to be the perfect wife and mother and she wanted to be everything that john mccain wanted her to be
9175778 and she pretty much was the perfect wife and mother but you know she had to come to the realisation that everything isnt perfect
9175779 my children and i not only trust my husband but know that he would never do anything to not only disappoint our family but disappoint the people of america

9175785 b amp b results were little short of appalling but this was expected
9175786 in the light of the turbulence in the banking and housing sectors the first six months of this year have been very challenging for b amp b
9175787 in the light of continuing weakness in the housing market and the wider economy we continue to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year although we will be putting further resources into tackling the problem
9175788 looking forward guidance is for margins to continue falling and arrears to continue rising earnings outlook is therefore very weak management have few levers to pull we fear
9175789 we provisionally expect b amp b to report a loss for 2008 as the loan book shrinks and credit quality deteriorates there is a risk the group remains unprofitable into 2009

9175797 if you look at my statistics over the last 12 months in relation to the other names that have been put in the potential wild card choices im 70 points in the world rankings ahead of paul casey and darren clarke
9175798 look at the statistics for the whole year i want to make this ryder cup side i want to play
9175799 you just have to keep at it and hope that you start hitting the right heel marks instead of the wrong heel marks
9175800 thats for the boys who are trying to get in automatically
9175801 im just trying to show im playing well to get a wild card
9175802 it feels like youre playing for your life out there
9175803 i dont know about that because it is not my job
9175804 if they can bring him here it will be down to board meetings i just have to think about tottenham the game tomorrow not about whether players have come
9175805 what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9175806 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9175807 we want to create the expectation that seats will have people on them
9175808 you cant stop sponsors buying seats nor should you but we must maximise the publics chances of seeing the games first hand
9175809 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb
9175810 but there are things we can and will do better i saw lots and lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason and i want our volunteers to be trained better and given a more clearly defined role
9175811 we cannot commit to such ideas at this stage but the principle of getting more people to museums and increasing access to londons cultural heritage we endorse
9175812 sporting participation is both an end in itself and a means to other ends
9175813 if you look at what works as an anti crime pro education pro health strategy among the young especially those from poorer backgrounds sport is unmatched
9175814 we have a cabinet committee working on security and high level planning is well advanced
9175815 when i took the job i had an idea of the kind of team that i wanted in my head
9175816 i wasnt able to take into account what other teams might do but i have pretty much got what i wanted
9175817 the guys have been out on the ice this week and what i thought i had and what i imagined in my head has all come together and more
9175818 i am really excited about this team and the quality of the players that we have signed
9175819 its alright having a good team on paper they have to go out and show it on the ice now but i am confident in the guys that have come in
9175820 weve had all sorts going bust full service low cost high end long haul and short haul because all buy petrol and all have customers getting poorer
9175821 there have been lots of failures already and there will be more
9175822 zoom is by no means the end it is inevitable there will be more bankruptcies as airlines currently flying on vapour realise its not going to work the reason it doesnt look so bad yet is because a lot still have good hedging in place
9175823 it will all depend on the airlines cash position fuel hedging and the ability to access extra funds but the situation is pretty dire
9175824 but i am optimistic we can get through its a terrific competition and we really enjoyed it last season as did the supporters
9175825 they are on a run they are on top of the league they won the league last season they beat barcelona in the second leg of their champions league qualifier this week we will have to do well at white hart lane
9175826 harrys very happy here he signed a new contract and i think the west ham thing was something and nothing i know you never say never but id say i was 99 9 per cent certain hes not going anywhere
9175827 you could argue that portsmouth is a better place to be than west ham weve got a lot of exciting things going on a very good team planning permission has just come in on the training ground which is going to be fantastic and the new stadium plans are going through between now and december so these are exciting times
9175828 there is no doubt he is a fantastically talented player the question now is can we get him fit and we are hoping we can do that
9175829 when we decided to build the stadium i wanted to anticipate the possibility of financial restrictions so i concentrated on youth i also felt the best way to create an identity with the way we play football to get players to integrate into our culture with our beliefs our values was to get them as young as possible and develop them together i felt it would be an interesting experiment to see players grow together with these qualities and with a love of the club
9175830 hes fired up he wants to play he wants to go out and show what he can do
9175831 we think that he can play well in davis cup hes had a few experiences that he hasnt enjoyed as much as we would have liked him to but we think he can change that around
9175832 hes a tough guy to play against and doesnt give you too much rhythm
9175833 but i feel like im playing well just now im confident and i look forward to the match
9175834 hes very different from many of the other players on the tour when the ball is your side of the court his body language suggests that he does not have much energy but when the ball is his side he bursts into action and covers the court extremely well he is a classic counter puncher he tries to make you fall asleep by playing lots of very long rallies hopefully i wont fall asleep against him
9175835 we had a close match earlier this year but i still believe i have the game to beat him i have to serve very well as hes one of the best returners in the game that could be the key i think i can do it
9175836 during the 2006 war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never sic resorted to this option because we thought at the time that not all the lebanese were responsible for the hizbollah attacks at that time we had hizbollah in our sights and not the lebanese state but the hizbollah do not live on the moon and some sic infrastructure was hit
9175837 its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
9175838 bidens being set up to protect israel while obama looks after the transportation system in chicago
9175839 if saintly men like gandhi could choose to clean latrines and thomas more could voluntarily wear a hair shirt this experience wont kill me
9175840 she certainly wasnt afraid to hit the ball pretty hard
9175841 it wasnt very busy but there were people sitting where we usually sit so i had to walk out while claire asked them to move i was too embarrassed to ask myself but they were very nice about it they moved though it obviously didnt work
9175842 i created opportunities for myself but i just didnt play those points the way i would have liked to
9175843 i can compete with these girls i dont think the gaps are as big as i once thought i know what i need to work on i can go back home now get stuck in and work on those things i feel like i can climb the rankings i feel the next stage for me is to break into the top 50
9175844 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9175845 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgement to be the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9175846 what im hearing from senator obama is a lot like what we heard from robert kennedy no matter what campaign ad we see or how its spun hope is important its what this country was based on
9175847 even though springsteen wont be playing barack obama was born to run
9175848 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9175849 i would rather hear you say that at the end of the trial rather than the beginning
9175850 may i hold you to your word that i am not guilty
9175851 when you get to know her you are going to be as impressed as i am
9175852 i know it will demand the best that i have to give
9175853 thats diversity right there isnt it wow and who do the republicans have good old rich white boys i think thats another factor that has to be considered by republicans that in some way their candidates are a reflection of more politics as usual not to slam good old rich boys but it sure wouldnt hurt for new energy and new perspective to be enveloped by the republican party
9175854 someone who has fought against corruption polices and failed policies of the past someone with experience who has shown great tenacity and skill in tackling tough problems she has strong principles a fighting sprit and deep compassion
9175855 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9175856 it is an another sign that the old barriers are falling in our politics
9175857 governor palin is a down the line mainstream conservative who will energise the conservative base and reach across party lines attracting women voters independents and blue collar workers
9175858 senator mccain has always been sensitive to national crises in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement to run for the presidency because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely
9175859 i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9175860 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against and the taliban in afghanistan
9175861 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
9175862 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
9175863 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9175864 we feel have been so beaten down and ignored we feel like puppets of the corporate world but he understands our voice
9175865 a fair bit of work was done behind the scenes to make sure everything can pass off peacefully its been a number of years since the royal black institution held a main parade here but all is expected to go well
9175866 when i arrived i wanted lampard thats no secret i wanted three players two wingers and a player in midfield who could do something different but i couldnt be happier with sulley muntari the ghanaian midfielder signed from portsmouth ive completely forgotten about lampard
9175867 serie a is a marathon by december i expect juventus milan roma and fiorentina to be up there with us by april it will be inter plus two by may well inter will be up there
9175868 is to watch a few premier league games to know the answer to that question is easy
9175869 would have given me lampard to him mourinho for obvious reasons no
9175870 im not like mourinho who has to win to feel secure about what hes doing
9175871 hes right im very demanding of myself i have to win to be happy maybe this is why i have won a lot ranieri doesnt need success to feel secure about the work he has done and maybe thats why at 70 hes only won a super cup and another small cup he probably needs to change his mentality but hes too old to do so
9175872 hes a coach who believes in the work he does and in his own ideas who demands effort collaboration and ability from his players hes convinced that the collective wins he arrived in milan with the objective of leaving indelible memories he wants to win to convince to entertain and to make history
9175873 it wont only be written in the almanacs but will be fixed for ever in the minds of all those who love football
9175874 in 13 or 14 years of playing football i have never done all the pre season preparation on the pitch the first week its hard but then you really fly
9175875 back to my childhood in brazil where you did everything with the ball at your feet its beautiful
9175876 in my career i only had one coach who used similar methods luis cesar menotti at sampdoria in the first five weeks of the season we were going at 2 000 miles an hour but afterwards we could hardly stay on our feet
9175877 in the first 45 minutes against roma in the super cup final we played with fantasy
9175878 we had players with quality playing within an organisation but producing moments of individual skill of great aesthetic beauty i havent seen a more creative player than zlatan ibrahimovic in the last year some players are clever because they play for the fans and some players are stupid because they play for the coach but in the long run its the stupid ones that get picked
9175879 its just another game its the most important game of my life because its the next game but weve worked all week to prepare for it and were ready
9175880 i dont understand this observation whoever said that is not in love with me at chelsea we scored the most goals and won the most matches away from home we played a very offensive and dynamic game
9175881 sony pr sente la t l la plus mince du monde
9175882 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
9175883 to cover war costs into the early months of a new administration those amounts combined would represent the highest level of military spending since the end of world war ii adjusted for inflation
9175884 m ore resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11
9175885 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education ill invest in early childhood education ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support
9175886 lockheed martin strongly supports our nations political process and candidates that support in general national defense homeland security high technology and educational initiatives
9175887 to present a different face to the world that could revive illusions in its democratic pretensions not only internationally but within the united states as well

9175936 top us and pakistani army commanders had a highly unusual secret meeting on board an american aircraft carrier in the indian ocean to discuss how to combat the escalating violence along the border between afghanistan and pakistan the leading actors in the day long conference were admiral mike mullen chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and pakistan army chief general ashfaq pervez kayani the meeting had been convened on tuesday august 26 by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff while officials of the two allies offered few details on wednesday about what was decided or even discussed at the meeting including any new strategies tactics weapons or troop deployment the star studded list of participants and an extreme secrecy surrounding the talks underscored how gravely the two nations regarded the growing militant threat
9175937 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be and that the military to military relationship were building with pakistan is getting stronger every day
9175938 there is a growing complexity and coordination among extremist groups there an almost syndicate like behaviour that has resulted in new and ever more sophisticated attacks on coalition forces
9175939 to try to do that through the eyes of the leadership who live and work and fight there every single day
9175940 the americans also said that they were afraid to share intelligence with pakistan because such data is often leaked to the militants
9175941 one of the main objectives of this meeting was to rebuild trust between us and pakistani militaries
9175942 we certainly talked about the complexity the challenges that we have in the border area the pressure that we believe needs to be brought there for lots of reasons not the least of which is the effects its having on the fight in afghanistan

9176027 envy is a incomparably more active passion than selfishness which is a benign sickness and the virus of equality urges us to wish for each others harm with obstinacy the hate for the others can be more powerful than the love for oneself
9176028 a personal diary has for me a more universal human value than a novel with masses with tens of thousands of people
9176029 preferable to the novel the tragedy the poem and the other literary genres as it is more complete and more true

9176032 the contribution of the new the most valuable innovation is that in order to destroy a person they do not go to his enemies but to his friends his wife his children his mistresses the ones he loves and in which he humanly foolishly has put his trust and his thirst of affection

9176043 ignorance stupidity a blind passing through life and among things or a careless living all come from the devil
9176044 man even if he has an important position or is placed somewhere in the lead of public affairs does not have the right to appeal to the principle of forgiveness in order to remain distant and cold in the presence of evil and to let innocent people be victims of the villains

9176047 i think we already lost the war and im afraid there is no military solution of this situation
9176048 when i said we georgians are not winners in this conflict it does not mean russia has won
9176049 russia showed once again its real face that it preferred to be the gendarme in international relations and not to be a distinguished member of the international community that will be respected
9176050 in due course i expect there will be some new waves of mass protests here in the country
9176051 to what extent this government will be able to survive those protests remains to be seen but it is obvious there will be some internal political instability
9176052 i do not see any major breach from our side the principles we stayed for years we do not want to confront russia with its huge resources but its russia that wants to reconquer georgia so we should not defend ourselves
9176053 its not something they feel comfortable with so the path of development of this situation and whether they will apply this invasion pattern to other countries in the neighborhood would depend on how strongly the international community would pursue the line it has taken
9176054 this is a very decisive moment either russia succeeds and the west fails or west succeeds and russia fails

9176058 noong panahon ni marcos may batas militar kaya laganap ang mga paglabag sa karapatang pantao pero sa ilalim ni arroyo nangyayari ang mga bagay na ito kahit hindi nagdedeklara ng batas militar
9176059 malaki ang papel ng mga kilusang nakikiisa sa amin sa pagkuha ng mga balita sa labas lalo na nang dumalang ang mga pagdinig sa korte at kapag parang hindi na namin makayanan ang mga tensiyon at kahirapan sa loob ng bilangguan

9176115 little research has examined the relationships between body image and sexual activity and responsivity among non diseased non disabled or non eating disordered women those studies that have been conducted offer inconsistent results weiderman amp hurst 1997 for example self ratings of facial attractiveness body image and general body satisfaction have been found to relate to frequency of sexual behaviors and amount of lifetime sexual experience in some studies faith amp schare 1993 maccorquodale amp delamater 1979 murstein amp holden 1979 more specifically a survey of 14 to 74 year old women found that those who were more satisfied with their body image reported more sexual initiation activity experimentation and orgasm than those who were dissatisfied ackard kearney cooke amp peterson 2000 among 20 to 65 year olds bancroft et al 2003 found that sexually active women felt more sexually attractive than women who had been inactive over the last four weeks wiederman and hurst 1997 found a significant relationship between sexual self schema or cognitive view of the self with regard to sexuality and self rated facial and body attractiveness among college women in contrast walsh 1993 1995 found a negative relationship between satisfaction with appearance among female college students and their lifetime number of sexual partners other researchers have found only a weak or no relationship between sexual experience or satisfaction and self rated attractiveness curran amp lippold 1975 feingold 1992 walker hill 2000
9176116 feeling frumpy the relationships between body image and sexual response changes in midlife women defined as age 35 55
9176117 participants us undergrads believed that an obese mans sexual experiences would be highly similar to those of a normal weight man however participants viewed an obese woman as less sexually attractive skilled warm and responsive and perceived her as less likely to experience desire and various sexual behaviors than a normal weight woman in addition participants believed that an obese woman was less sexually attractive skilled warm and responsive than an obese man
9176118 across indices of heterosexual experience some attractiveness and body imagevariables evidenced fairly consistent relationships whereas others did not women who were relatively heavier higher bmi and rated as less facially attractive by the experimenters were less likely to be involved in a steady dating relationship and to have had sexual intercourse also heavier women were less likely to have received oral sex from a male and women rated as less facially attractive were less likely to have performed oral sex on a male are these general relationships between body size and attractiveness and sexual experience due to a lack of opportunity differential sexual attitudes or inhibition due to self consciousness on the part of larger women although there are surely other explanations for the current findings we conclude that a relative lack of opportunity for heterosexual interaction because of less interest by potential partners may be the primary reason behind most of the relationships between bmi and dating and sexual experience

9176208 roland jabbours claim made in the name of the australian arabic council that anti semitic blood libels and demeaning depictions of jewish people are acceptable in the context of the perceived crimes of the state of israel is deplorable
9176209 it broadcasts disgraceful anti semitic propaganda including the infamous blood libel allegations and it seeks to legitimize terrorism
9176210 australian jews like all other australians have the right to live without being subjected to this kind of vicious defamation the adc condemns all forms of racism including anti semitism and works for a tolerant society that recognizes the right of people of all religions and backgrounds to live free from discrimination and abuse

9176223 during the past year a rash of reports on the situation of women in afghanistan has been issued by afghan governmental agencies and by foreign and local non governmental organizations ngos that claim a particular interest in womens rights or in afghanistan or both more reports are in the offing what has sparked them is the dire situation of women in the country the systematic violations of their human rights and the failure of concerned parties to achieve significant improvements by providing women with legal protections rooted in a capable honest and stable judiciary system education and employment opportunities safety from violence much of it savage and protection from hidebound customs originating in the conviction that women are the property of men

9176226 through the united action of the students these intelligence agents have been prevented from doing their dirty work the students collective action also barred the armed members of the philippine national police from endangering the lives of many youth and students
9176227 such an act is unforgivable and the youth will not let this crime be brushed aside
9176228 as students become more involved in national and educational concerns the presence of intelligence units are meant to monitor the student actions pinpoint the organizations sow fear inside the campus and ultimately disrupt the student movement
9176229 it is clear from whom such orders emanate the commander in chief herself
9176230 gloria arroyos militaristic method in confronting the peoples unrest is no longer a secret the all out war for her political survival being waged in mindanao is escalating now it has reached the very halls of our educational institutions
9176231 we may see more of these attempts in the coming weeks but the youth are ready to retaliate the youth will continue exposing these underhanded moves by mrs arroyo and the military
9176232 mrs arroyo and the afp may fool themselves into thinking that they have doused cold water on the student movement but they are very much wrong they have only fueled the burning desire of the youth to end the oppressive arroyo regime
9176233 non access to public information can lead to or be used to hide corruption
9176234 the right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized access to official records and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts transactions or decisions as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development shall be afforded the citizen subject to such limitations as may be provided by law
9176235 subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law the state adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest
9176236 even if we have a very clear constitutional guarantee many have denied our right to information
9176237 the dof department of finance continues to deny these even if these clearly involve tax money
9176238 non access can lead to or be used to hide corruption
9176239 if you have a government that is open you wont be needing legislation or a constitutional guarantee
9176240 the problem is when we have a government that tends toward secrecy
9176241 we stand a very good chance of passing a law to access information
9176242 what is left now is to secure a counterpart bill in the senate
9176243 pichays appointment is obviously is a political accommodation clearly mrs gloria arroyo no longer recognizes that qualification matters in appointing agency heads we believe that pichay would only contribute to the worsening problems of privatization and corruption that are besetting the lwua
9176244 arroyo should have heeded the voice of the people that already rejected pichay and the rest of the team unity candidates when they lost in the elections
9176245 but it is clear that what is more important to her is political payback rather than service to the people
9176246 how could she leave the country if she was sick when she had to go through a medical checkup
9176247 nagulat talaga kami wala kaming nagawa kundi umiyak ng umiyak

9176255 we do not intend to remove or fight with actual occupants in our pursuit for recognition as original claimants to the land
9176256 in his time mateo cari o lived in kafaguay now the rizal park right in front of city hall the americans expropriated through act no 636 a portion one kilometer in radius from this point for institutional purposes
9176257 in april 1908 mateo bought back some portions of his property he died two months later in june that year
9176258 it is sad that in his own country the laws application is yet to be seen with the property for which the us supreme court then ruled still largely under state control
9176259 mateo petitioned the land registration court of the philippine government for a title covering 148 hectares of the camp john hay reservation in the city of baguio which the group has been occupying since time immemorial as natives of the land the motion was granted
9176260 in 1904 the government appealed the decision of the land registration court with the court of first instance claiming that cari o had no right over the land since he was not able to present any spanish title the court of first instance ruled in favor of the government
9176261 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9176262 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

9176264 bushs job is to figure out a way to pass the torch in a way that does the least damage
9176265 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9176266 he knows its not his convention hes had two of them and hell behave accordingly
9176267 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
9176268 the aliens can not reveal anything about anyones life that would not be known without the use of our technology the exception being that if a reader has a question about his or her health and the assistance of alien technology would be necessary to answer that question

9176290 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9176291 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9176292 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9176293 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9176294 its not going to change its not a family show
9176295 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
9176296 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
9176297 katrina hasnt been explored in film and hasnt been explored enough in general
9176298 so i think no matter what even if its a few people going to the theaters they will at least get part of the message of what the travesty was when that hurricane came through the city and then have to look at themselves and their government about what it means to leave people abandoned when the earth itself struck against them
9176299 i want it to be true authentic greatly for the people of new orleans who have experienced this
9176300 more importantly for the people of the country and the world to understand this
9176301 i couldnt help but think about the moment i first saw it and the movement of that
9176302 and maybe this is personal in a way scott reminds me of my brother they walked alike they look alike physically and my brothers passed on
9176303 every time i see it theres something else that hits me in some sort of way
9176304 we have to begin to re educate ourselves about the kind of cultural work we want to be doing and the kind of change we want
9176305 i see this film as a platform i want it to be an issue this election season
9176306 its just a beautiful documentary it just captures everything about life
9176307 we had no story we had no actors we had no locations we had nothing
9176308 all i was told was we had to do one 15 minute film on hope the first thing i thought of the first thing that popped to mind was katrina
9176309 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9176310 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9176311 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9176312 if the law is passed by september 9 or 10 we can hold the elections on december 22 if its later than that we will try for december 31
9176313 in picking an unknown untested half a term governor from alaska john mccain is following in a long line of reckless men who have rolled the dice for a beauty queen
9176314 and this stuff about being inexperienced they cant knock sarah that way not from the obama campaign
9176315 if she does get in there im sure shes going to be pushing for a lot of issues that are really important for us alaskans
9176316 i like her but she doesnt have the experience to be on the national level
9176317 mccain is 72 years old with a history of cancer you know if she had to step in as president what about foreign affairs shes just not ready
9176318 i was really shocked i thought it would be someone like mitt romney
9176319 hes taking a big chance putting her on the ticket i dont think she has the depth
9176320 i dont think hard core democrats are going to go for that
9176321 the energy is high just because people are pleased with the attention it brings to alaska especially rural alaska
9176322 ive always been a fan of hers her speech this morning was out of this world shes so eloquent
9176323 it will be good for alaska because people always have this mentality that alaska is not part of the united states
9176324 i would have liked to see an obama palin ticket
9176325 shes a tremendous governor i would hate to lose her as governor

9176343 we are assessing the situation but one thing is for certain that we will not risk the safety of our employees
9176344 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today saturday
9176345 we have not indulged in any of violence and will not do it we will continue our movement peacefully
9176346 there are many organisations here we cannot take responsibility for the actions of others
9176347 we have a one point agenda that the 400 acres will have to be returned to unwilling farmers unless the government accepts our demand we will continue our agitation

9176351 i feel good about what im doing for them and it gives me a chance to communicate with them
9176352 when we go out and observe at the high schools we are disappointed because the students are taking only pizza and milk
9176353 the school meal program mirrors whats happening with the economy overall
9176354 if they can help pick the bag and pack it they may be more invested in eating it
9176355 maybe i can buy tommy that train hes always wanted
9176356 sir weve got nearly a billion dollars in payments coming due
9176357 but thats in the future this money is here right now look at it all
9176358 maaaaa jim took our money and he wont give it back
9176359 i am positively surprised with the enormous potential of this group theres a lot of very good young players but were basically a long way from the level that were looking for
9176360 its fun i am working with players on a daily basis again and that feels great and i have a central position in the club organization and i am constantly working on different aspects
9176361 we train twice a day in this phase and in between theres numerous other stuff to do organisational and the like its very busy and the task is grand theres a lot of things that i have to have an opinion about so im still a bit searching and looking around and getting used to stuff people come to me with questions and all i will need to get some structure going
9176362 people always mock the dutch knvb football federation but thats not fair i have worked their with a lot of satisfaction for four years the organization is very good the facilities and infrastructure is there and they have a number of topnotch people working for them but working at ajax is more fun for me because i have the players every day so my impact is bigger now
9176363 players need to play together a lot to form a team we have that team process as well in terms of management and decision making thats why i like a lot of communication and meeting i may be the one to call the shots but after ample consideration im happy with where we are but i can see more room for improvement id like to see a separate and new trainings facility we need to keep on dreaming on that
9176364 i assume you mean the last friendly laughs i liked it i enjoyed myself i think oranje played very well both in defense and offense they could and maybe should have won that game but it was good to have seen so many opportunities a good start
9176365 i would not say there will not be any more outgoings before mondays transfer deadline
9176366 hes really got his head down along with most of the players hes trained fantastically and got himself very fit
9176367 you saw that at coventry everyone had a different man of the match and i thought charles nzogbia was as good as anybody on the pitch and for me might just have shaded it
9176368 im really pleased with charles there was a time after christmas when i first came in when i really did question whether the guy wanted to be part of what we wanted to do here
9176369 maybe that little spell on the sidelines he may have thought what i believe is the truth where could he move thats better than this
9176370 i think the pennys really dropped with him and im delighted its like having a new player
9176371 once he sorted his attitude out which he did towards the end of last season hes been a great kid to have around hes an excellent player because he can play different positions

9176384 it was for the central government to see the pros and cons for starting talks with us on august 23

9176386 they took the body away before there was a chance for postmortem then the fact would have been much clearer

9176441 india doesnt really have a band culture the promos look slick and the effort genuine if the film does well we might see more films on bands even if someone doesnt belong to a band or doesnt connect with rock music the idea of one man chasing his dream will have its appeal in colleges of most urban cities there are hundreds of youngsters who sometime or the other dream of forming their own band
9176442 one way of looking at rock on is that it is an underdog story which never goes wrong beyond male bonding and friendship theres the dream the soul searching and coming together of friends makes for an engaging story
9176443 arjun rampal purab and kenny made me feel we were actually making music
9176444 its hard to judge from the promos the exact theme of the movie by the looks of it its more about their personal lives than the band itself which should be interesting the movie looks pretty slick theres this common belief that with rock and roll comes sex and drugs most bands think that music gives them power to be rebellious and anti system we he and faisal just hope that rock on shows the viewer a bigger and brighter picture of how rock and roll can change the world and not just four guys coming together and making music
9176445 if the film is a hit more people will make movies about music bands if not you may not see a film like this for another two to three years

9176516 i think some of those areas are going to get hit hard again and its really going to squeeze people
9176517 we are seeing gas price increases here that are based on the possibility that there may be some supply dislocation
9176518 that would affect supply close to the affected area as opposed to anywhere else

9176521 respect is not a passive act to respect someone is to look for the springs that feed the pool of their experience
9176522 our ability to perceive is a present moment competence it diminishes as we think about the past or worry about the future
9176523 mere factual innocence is no reason not to carry out a death sentence properly reached
9176524 there is no basis in text tradition or even in contemporary practice if that were enough for finding in the constitution a right to demand judicial consideration of newly discovered evidence of innocence brought forward after conviction
9176525 my concern is that in making life easier for ourselves we not appear to make it harder for the lower federal courts imposing upon them the burden of regularly analyzing newly discovered evidence of innocence claims in capital cases in which event such federal claims it can confidently be predicted will become routine and even repetitive this quote above is scalias opinion regarding the issue of newly discovered evidence
9176526 federal courts are not forums in which to relitigate state trials
9176527 claims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence have never been held to state a ground for federal habeas relief absent an independent constitutional violation occurring in the underlying state criminal proceeding chief justice warren made this clear
9176528 no evidence at trial remotely suggest ed that anyone other than petitioner committed the offense
9176529 in order to ensure that petitioner can assert his constitutional claims and out of a sense of fairness and due process
9176530 the existence merely of newly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of a state prisoner is not a ground for relief on federal habeas corpus
9176531 d ue process does not require that every conceivable step be taken at whatever cost to eliminate the possibility of convicting an innocent person
9176532 the purpose of the trial stage from the states point of view is to convert a criminal defendant from a person presumed innocent to one found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
9176533 where newly discovered evidence is alleged in a habeas application evidence which could not reasonably have been presented to the state trier of facts the federal court must grant an evidentiary hearing of course such evidence must bear upon the constitutionality of the applicants detention
9176534 w hat we have to deal with on habeas review is not the petitioners innocence or guilt but solely the question whether their constitutional rights have been preserved
9176535 federal courts are not forums in which to relitigate state trials
9176536 societys resources have been concentrated at that time and place in order to decide within the limits of human fallibility the question of guilt or innocence of one of its citizens
9176537 t his inquiry does not require a court to ask itself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt instead the relevant question is whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt this familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony to weigh the evidence and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts
9176538 the standard announced does not permit a court to make its own subjective determination of guilt or innocence
9176539 an important initial opportunity to hear the evidence and resolve the merits of petitioners claim
9176540 discretion to order discovery when it would help the court make a reliable determination with respect to the prisoners claim
9176541 make a case by case determination about the reliability of newly discovered evidence under the circumstances
9176542 weigh the evidence in favor of the prisoner against the evidence of his guilt
9176543 w hen a habeas petitioner succeeds in obtaining a new trial the erosion of memory and dispersion of witnesses that occur with the passage of time prejudice the government and diminish the chances of a reliable criminal adjudication
9176544 only where the prisoner supplements his constitutional claim with a colorable showing of factual innocence
9176545 refused to hold that the fact that a death sentence has been imposed requires a different standard of review on federal habeas corpus
9176546 i f the constitution renders the fact or timing of his execution contingent upon establishment of a further fact
9176547 then that fact must be determined with the high regard for truth that befits a decision affecting the life or death of a human being
9176548 with the high regard for truth that befits a decision affecting the life or death of a human being
9176549 b ecause the states have considerable expertise in matters of criminal procedure and the criminal process is grounded in centuries of common law tradition
9176550 exercis ed substantial deference to legislative judgments in this area
9176551 offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental
9176552 historical practice is probative of whether a procedural rule can be characterized as fundamental
9176553 reasons for which new trials have usually been granted in courts of law
9176554 the court at a subsequent term has power to correct inaccuracies in mere matters of form or clerical errors
9176555 a motion for new trial based on the ground of newly discovered evidence may be made only before or within two years after final judgment
9176556 one of the great advantages of monarchy in general above any other form of government that there is a magistrate who has it in his power to extend mercy wherever he thinks it is deserved holding a court of equity in his own breast to soften the rigour of the general law in such criminal cases as merit an exemption from punishment
9176557 power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the united states
9176558 as this power had been exercised from time immemorial by the executive of that nation whose language is our language and to whose judicial institutions ours bears a close resemblance we adopt their principles respecting the operation and effect of a pardon and look into their books for the rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be used by the person who would avail himself of it
9176559 a pardon is an act of grace proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws which exempts the individual on whom it is bestowed from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed it is the private though official act of the executive magistrate delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended and not communicated officially to the court it is a constituent part of the judicial system that the judge sees only with judicial eyes and knows nothing respecting any particular case of which he is not informed judicially a private deed not communicated to him whatever may be its character whether a pardon or release is totally unknown and cannot be acted on the looseness which would be introduced into judicial proceedings would prove fatal to the great principles of justice if the judge might notice and act upon facts not brought regularly into the cause such a proceeding in ordinary cases would subvert the best established principles and overturn those rules which have been settled by the wisdom of ages
9176560 the criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel
9176561 1 a written unanimous recommendation of the current trial officials of the court of conviction and or 2 a certified order or judgment of a court having jurisdiction accompanied by certified copy of the findings of fact if any and 3 affidavits of witnesses upon which the finding of innocence is based
9176562 the trial is the paramount event for determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant
9176563 for the sake of argument in deciding this case that in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of actual innocence made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional and warrant federal habeas relief if there were no state avenue open to process such a claim
9176564 petitioner would at the very least be required to show that based on proffered newly discovered evidence and the entire record before the jury that convicted him no rational trier of fact could find proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt
9176565 i would hold that to obtain relief on a claim of actual innocence the petitioner must show that he probably is innocent
9176566 i am terribly sorry for those to whom i have brought grief what happened to rucker was for a certain reason h e violated some of the laws of my drug business and suffered the penalty like the one you have for me when the time comes the other officer carrisalez had not hing to do with this he was out to do what he had to do protect but thats life i f this is read word for word over the media i will turn myself in
9176567 so insubstantial that it could be dismissed without any hearing at all
9176568 it plainly appear ed from the face of the petition and the exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner wa s not entitled to relief
9176569 second or successive federal habeas petition s should be granted only when there are substantial grounds upon which relief might be granted
9176570 as a habeas petition or 1983 action what is sought is an equitable remedy
9176571 it must prejudice the occasional meritorious application to be buried in a flood of worthless ones he who must search a haystack for a needle is likely to end up with the attitude that the needle is not worth the search
9176572 that a constitutional right exists and expends substantial judicial resources on that assumption the courts extensive and scholarly discussion of the question presented in the present case does nothing but support our statement in
9176573 no rational trier of fact could find proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
9176574 for the sake of argument in deciding this case that in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstration of actual innocence made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional
9176575 nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering
9176576 grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime
9176577 the jury was allowed to consider evidence that has been revealed to be materially inaccurate
9176578 to insure that the death penalty is indeed imposed on the basis of reason rather than caprice or emotion we have invalidated procedural rules that tended to diminish the reliability of the sentencing determination the same reasoning must apply to rules that diminish the reliability of the guilt determination thus if the unavailability of a lesser included offense instruction enhances the risk of an unwarranted conviction the state is constitutionally prohibited from withdrawing that option in a capital case
9176579 the due process clause of the fifth amendment provides that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law this court has held that the due process clause protects individuals against two types of government action so called substantive due process prevents the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the conscience palko v connecticut 302 u s 319 325 326 58 s ct 149 152 82 l ed 288 1937 when government action depriving a person of life liberty or property survives substantive due process scrutiny it must still be implemented in a fair manner mathews v eldridge 424 u s 319 335 96 s ct 893 903 47 l ed 2d 18 1976 this requirement has traditionally been referred to as procedural due process
9176580 t he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the due process clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the constitution
9176581 illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there the forcible extraction of his stomachs contents this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities they are methods too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation
9176582 the existence merely of newly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of a state prisoner is not a ground for relief on federal habeas corpus
9176583 the prisoner may have a vital interest in having a second chance to test the fundamental justice of his incarceration even where as here the many judges who have reviewed the prisoners claims in several proceedings provided by the state and on his first petition for federal habeas corpus have determined that his trial was free from constitutional error a prisoner retains a powerful and legitimate interest in obtaining his release from custody if he is innocent of the charge for which he was incarcerated that interest does not extend however to prisoners whose guilt is conceded or plain
9176584 retains a powerful and legitimate interest in obtaining his release from custody if he is innocent of the charge for which he was incarcerated
9176585 the claim of actual innocence is not itself a constitutional claim but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits
9176586 exists in every case in which a defendant challenges his sentence under the eighth amendment recognition of such a bare possibility would make judicial review under the eighth amendment meaningless
9176587 the government of the united states has been emphatically termed a government of laws and not of men it will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right
9176588 the very purpose of a bill of rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts
9176589 it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief
9176590 in state criminal proceedings the trial is the paramount event for determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant
9176591 a truly persuasive demonstration of actual innocence made after trial would render the execution of a defendant unconstitutional
9176592 require the habeas court to hear testimony from the witnesses who testified at the trial
9176593 those who made the statements in the affidavits which petitioner has presented
9176594 it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief
9176595 to whom it may concern i am terribly sorry for those i have brought grief to their lives who knows why we cannot change the futures problems with problems from the past what i did was for a cause and purpose one law runs others and in the world we live in thats the way it is
9176596 what happened to rucker was for a certain reason i knew him as mike tatum he was in my business and he violated some of its laws and suffered the penalty like the one you have for me when the time comes
9176597 my personal life which has been a conspiracy since my high school days has nothing to do with what has happened
9176598 you have wrote all you want of my life but think about yours also signed leonel herrera
9176599 i have tapes and pictures to prove what i have said i will prove my side if you accept to listen you unintelligible word freedom of speech even a criminal has that right i will present myself if this is read word for word over the media i will turn myself in if not dont have millions of men out there working just on me while others robbers rapists or burglars are taking advantage of the laws time excuse my spelling and writing its hard at times like this
9176600 at least in capital cases the eighth amendment requires more than reliability in sentencing it also mandates a reliable determination of guilt
9176601 e xecution of an innocent person is the ultimate arbitrary impositio n
9176602 petitioner may raise a substantive due process challenge to his punishment on the ground that he is actually innocent
9176603 it is suggested that there should be a definite time limit within which motions for new trial based on newly discovered evidence should be made unless the trial court in its discretion for good cause shown allows the motion to be filed is it not desirable that at some point of time further consideration of criminal cases by the court should be at an end after which appeals should be made to executive clemency alone
9176604 t he vindication of rights guaranteed by the constitution has never been made to turn on the unreviewable discretion of an executive official or administrative tribunal
9176605 inadequate to preclude federal redetermination of the constitutional issue of fords sanity
9176606 even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the crime of having a common cold
9176607 death is a different kind of punishment from any other which may be imposed in this country
9176608 unlike the question of guilt or innocence the issue of sanity is properly considered in proximity to the execution
9176609 whether the rule transgresses any recognized principle of fundamental fairness in operation
9176610 show by clear and convincing evidence that but for a constitutional error no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under applicable state law

9176671 it is precisely because of the al yamamah complication that i urge a halt in the drive to remove president musharraf from power the bandar crowd in saudi arabia should not be allowed to control the destiny of pakistan and that is exactly where we are headed if musharrafs removal is allowed there is a serious narco terrorist factor to deal with centered around the taliban and al qaeda nexus which enjoys continuing support from the relevant british and saudi factions
9176672 they will wreak havoc on the entire region and that does not serve u s or regional interests in the least
9176673 the bush white house is absolutely indifferent to the situation on the ground
9176674 it is looking more and more like the white house has been outright bought up by the saudis judging from some of the policies coming out of bush and company
9176675 president musharrafs regrettable retirement will only make matters worse and for that i hold president bush and the bush white house responsible any serious american president would have put his foot down and demanded that the saudis and their british allies stop the interference in the pakistan situation
9176676 musharraf was the only leader who could maintain stability in an extremely complex country like pakistan restrain radical islamists and guarantee that the nuclear potential would remain under control the so called oppositions corrupt leaders let out of an anglo american jar hate each other and are incapable of ensuring either in the view of responsible american analysts the pakistani bomb is much more dangerous than the non existent iranian one who gets it and what happens to this not quite low priority and not the least populated region this is what the united states european partners should be thinking about not about the moaning of a whipped georgian paranoid man
9176677 the whole thing was obvious to me it was obvious in the discussions i had with people that while pakistan was already a mess by this concession of dumping musharraf you actually unleash all the instabilities in the area and pakistan is a nuclear power in a sense but the more significant thing is that the whole thing was done by the saudis thats what has to be said and this thing is an anglo american saudi operation
9176678 the saudi bandar al yamamah operation is whats key here and the whole region is in trouble because the saudis are the center of the whole destabilization of the region its a saudi british operation in which prince bandar is crucial the bush family is deeply indebted in a sense to these saudi types the corruption goes right inside the united states government the bandar saudi operation and the bush connections to that are absolutely crucial
9176679 leontyev is right hes absolutely correct its just that hes left out this one part that this is a case in which the london saudi operation the bae connected operation is the key monster in this thing which is a controlling factor in the u s behavior you dont need to have a president barack obama because the real presidency is the saudi monarchy the white house is a dependency of the saudi monarchy
9176680 this is not a situation that lends itself to a military solution
9176681 this requires serious strategic planning and a wide range of actions including hard nosed diplomacy this is a war that the united states cannot win with boots on the ground the musharraf departure means a whole new situation
9176682 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9176683 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9176684 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9176685 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9176686 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9176687 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9176688 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9176689 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9176690 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9176691 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9176692 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9176693 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9176694 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9176695 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9176696 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9176697 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9176698 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9176699 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9176700 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9176701 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9176702 who are open to doing something on the production side
9176703 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9176704 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9176705 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9176706 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9176707 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9176708 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9176709 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9176710 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9176711 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9176712 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9176713 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9176714 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9176715 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

9176718 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9176719 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

9176724 apparently you dont know how we do things in scotland we settle small disagreements like this with the scottish three kick rule
9176725 well first i kick you three times and then you kick me three times and so on back and forth until someone gives up
9176726 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9176727 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9176728 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9176729 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9176730 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9176731 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9176732 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9176733 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9176734 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9176735 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9176736 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9176737 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9176738 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9176739 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9176740 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9176741 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9176742 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9176743 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9176744 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9176745 attended board meetings retreats and at least one news conference together
9176746 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9176747 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9176748 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

9176752 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9176753 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9176754 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9176755 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9176756 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

9177035 zoom airlines sincerely regrets to advise its customers that it has suspended operations with effect from 19 00 hrs on thursday 28 august 2008 both zoom airlines inc and zoom airlines ltd the canadian and uk airlines have started administration proceedings in their home countries
9177036 we have set out details of other airlines who operate the same or similar routes to those flown with zoom in the hope that this may assist you in making alternative travel plans to replace the flights that you had booked with zoom
9177037 if your travel arrangements have been made as part of a holiday package originating in the canada and booked through a holiday company you may be able to make a claim under the ticos compensation fund
9177038 if your travel arrangements have been made as part of a holiday package originating in the uk and booked through a holiday company you may be able to make a claim under the caas air travel organisers licence scheme for information on this please consult the caa atol website at
9177039 hugh and john boyle the founders of zoom said tonight
9177040 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
9177041 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings
9177042 the suspension of operations is a result of the exceptionally difficult trading conditions which have affected all airlines over the last 12 months we have worked hard over the last seven years to build up a successful business but have incurred losses in the current year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate the increase in the price of oil has added around 50 million to our annual operating costs and we could not recover that from passengers who had already booked their flights
9177043 we would like to thank the many thousands of passengers who chose to travel with zoom during the last seven years and efforts of the airlines staff we are extremely sorry for todays unavoidable actions

9177059 if they cant or choose not to repay their loan borro sells the items they have pledged to repay the loan and returns any excess proceeds to the customer this means that the consequences of not paying off a loan are very clear and that it is impossible for our customers to build up any bad debt through taking out a borro loan

9177062 the credit crunch and soaring consumer prices are clearly having a massive impact on british families this is extremely worrying news for gordon brown who claims that all is well
9177063 the government cannot possibly continue to play down the severity of the economic crisis the uk faces when millions of people can barely make ends meet one in seven adults are now trapped below the poverty line
9177064 gordon brown needs to wake up to the reality that we are now teetering on the brink of recession he must act to help the millions of families struggling against high taxes rising bills and falling disposable income

9177199 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9177200 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9177201 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9177202 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9177203 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9177204 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9177205 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9177206 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9177207 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9177208 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9177209 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9177210 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9177211 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9177212 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9177213 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9177214 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9177215 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9177216 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9177217 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9177218 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9177219 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9177220 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9177221 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9177222 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9177223 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9177224 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9177225 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9177226 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9177227 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9177228 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9177229 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9177230 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9177231 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9177232 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9177233 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9177234 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9177235 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9177236 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9177237 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9177238 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9177239 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9177240 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9177241 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9177242 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9177243 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9177244 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9177245 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9177246 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9177247 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9177248 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9177249 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9177250 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9177251 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9177252 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9177253 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9177254 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9177255 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9177256 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9177257 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9177258 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9177259 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9177260 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9177261 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9177262 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9177263 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9177264 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9177265 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9177266 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9177267 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9177268 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9177269 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9177270 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9177271 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9177272 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9177273 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9177274 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9177275 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9177276 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9177277 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9177278 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9177279 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9177280 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9177281 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9177282 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9177283 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9177284 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9177285 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9177286 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9177287 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9177288 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9177289 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9177290 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9177291 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9177292 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9177293 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9177294 no one works for someone we all just work together
9177295 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9177296 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9177297 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9177298 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9177299 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9177300 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9177301 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9177302 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9177303 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9177304 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9177305 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9177306 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9177307 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9177308 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9177309 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9177310 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9177311 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9177312 in my experience some clinicians continue to prescribe brand name b vitamin supplements to such patients at a cost of hundreds of dollars annually this practice can no longer be justified
9177313 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9177314 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9177315 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9177316 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid

9177504 this fight here is the one that when it was presented to me i was like wow
9177505 talk about a gift wrapped opportunity to get myself redemption this was it so i was glad that the opportunity came with this type of a fight
9177506 its definitely not a top 10 fighter but at the same time he has the recognition and popularity of a top 10 fighter
9177507 ill accept all the criticism and ill accept all the things that come with it
9177508 but again im a fighter ive been a fighter since i was a little kid and you cant tell me to stop being that person
9177509 im just a fighter if a fight comes my way and its offered to me and i take it i take those chances i take those chances every time i get in the ring
9177510 ive learned this my whole career that no matter what you do whether youre winning or losing people are going to have their criticisms about you youve got to learn to deal with them
9177511 i can understand someone getting upset because they got passed over but dont get upset at a person for taking an opportunity thats given to them i wouldnt get upset at somebody that had an opportunity passed to them
9177512 so dont be throwing stones at someone thats just trying to further themselves and get an opportunity because thats what life is all about opportunity and seizing those opportunities you dont step on people because they want to take them
9177513 i can only control what i can control and thats the moment if for some reason he lands a lucky shot or catches me or whatever thats life
9177514 if someone would say im going to take everything that youve done and its all going to work against you in one fight all of the years that youve put in this one fight is going to take all of that away then so be it take it away youll never take it away in my heart
9177515 ill take the applause and now ill take the criticism too
9177516 its criticism time right now and im taking it but my opportunity to shut the criticism up is just right around the corner
9177517 kimbos going to come out hes going to try and keep his space hes going to try and land his punches bas rutten is going to coach him well but the end result is going to be the end result im going to win this fight
9177518 whether it goes three rounds which i doubt or it goes one round im going to win the fight
9177519 i woke up in the morning and said was that a dream
9177520 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9177521 many people find dslr cameras too heavy and big to carry so samsung will introduce a new hybrid system that will be small and light like a bridge type camera but with interchangeable samsung made lenses
9177522 scotlands economy is showing real resilience in what are challenging times and mr darlings ridiculous interview is in danger of dragging everyone down to the labour partys own level just as his hesitation on stamp duty froze the housing market
9177523 you are fairly rude in the guardian about a couple of colleagues you think wendy alexander is unlikeable
9177524 i have got the utmost admiration for wendy and the problems she went through
9177525 no i have the utmost respect for her and i thoroughly enjoy her encounters whenever we have them
9177526 brian i have the utmost regard for wendy and i will continue to have it and that remains my position
9177527 what is needed from alistair darling is action for economic recovery not words about economic depression
9177528 those two things have not come together at the same time and this is what is affecting us its affecting every developed country
9177529 take action to help the economy and to help people get through this difficult time
9177530 i have got the utmost admiration for wendy and the problems she went through
9177531 i have the utmost respect for her and i thoroughly enjoy her encounters whenever we have them
9177532 what is the role of the press particularly cable news in this election and at what point do we tip to a kind of minute picking apart and tea leaf reading
9177533 grant me o lord my god a mind to know you a heart to seek you wisdom to find you conduct pleasing to you faithful perseverance in waiting for you and a hope of finally embracing you

9177537 reckless road guns n roses and the making of appetite for destruction
9177538 its up to the youngsters in the next games to stake a claim
9177539 this is a time for us to start moving out of an era when we were very very good forward to the 2011 world cup
9177540 it was a very very special test series victory for us
9177541 we ended that part of the tour and this part has been hugely disappointing
9177542 our attack is very inexperienced in terms of one day cricket and in some key batting areas weve got a lot of younger players
9177543 we need to get them out there and expose them
9177544 guys need to focus on their positions in the one day team
9177545 weve got to kick on from here now and keep churning results out but there is a great feeling in that dressing room having beaten a side like south africa
9177546 its frustrated us that people have been saying south africa just want to get home and theyre not interested theyve been playing to be number one side in the world
9177547 these games arent dead rubbers playing for england never is
9177548 ive had a few headaches in my time but none from a cricket ball it hit me quite hard and dazed me for a little bit so i got a headache for a little bit but winning the series eased the pain
9177549 ive had a few glancing blows but none as hard as that
9177550 i know i can bat but its such a fine line between scoring runs and not scoring them to get two 70s and the manner in which ive got them is very pleasing
9177551 to be able to get yourself in before you tee off at the end is a bonus and its a role which i feel comfortable in
9177552 we should not forget what vaughany michael vaughan did he was an amazing captain but sometimes a new captain brings a freshness to the side
9177553 i wont rush into a decision we will have to look at what we have and what is the best use of the funds we will have
9177554 weve put a 7million bid on the table to manchester united
9177555 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian berbatov
9177556 as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation
9177557 if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring campbell to the football club
9177558 there will be a lot of people alluding to the fact weve got carried away with ourselves but i can absolutely guarantee that im here for the long term building the football club
9177559 and we are going to have to get braver in some of the things we do but it will never be at the cost of threatening the security and financial ability of the club long term
9177560 we hope the government will be less inclined to prosecute american muslim nonprofits and mosques for supporting terrorist causes if they demonstrate that they meet the highest standards of legal compliance financial accountability and good governance
9177561 useful first step toward keeping muslim charities from being shut down
9177562 fundamental change requires a change in the governments basic approach to interpreting the law
9177563 in order to preserve the rights of all nonprofit organizations and indeed the rights of all people all levels of government must conduct their counterterrorism activities in a way that consistently protects liberty and civil society otherwise americans and others lose safeguards that were designed to protect us all from creeping tyranny
9177564 constraining the critical activities of the charitable and philanthropic sectors stifling free speech and ultimately impeding the fight against terrorism
9177565 u s counterterrorism laws have made it increasingly difficult for u s based organizations to operate overseas for example after the 2004 tsunami u s organizations operating in areas controlled by the tamil tigers a designated terrorist organization risked violating prohibitions against material support when creating displaced persons camps and hospitals traveling or distributing food and water
9177566 conduits for terrorist funding and a breeding ground for aggressive dissent
9177567 congress has not utilized its oversight powers to review counterterrorism programs
9177568 operates in fear of what may spark the government to use its power to shut them down
9177569 i dont think there should be special rules governing not for profits that support muslim causes this has evolved into a bizarre regulatory regime that is unduly discriminatory
9177570 but but but mondales a man and ferraros a woman what if they lose control and have sex with each other or something
9177571 i was never really in danger so it was actually pretty good for me
9177572 i knew the longer the match would go the more tired he would get so it was a good match for me
9177573 up here above their shoulders for a lot of guys with me it might be at shoulder level
9177574 theres not going to be a lot of baseline rallies but still thats a tough serve

9177585 will probably be moving the market one way or the other
9177586 if it fizzles then it will be a big relief on oil prices
9177587 if you look at gdp youre led to believe the economy is solid
9177588 but if you look at the variables employment industrial production and personal income the economy does not look solid but weak
9177589 the markets are extremely volatile and moving according to macroeconomic news quite a bit
9177590 all of this data has the potential to be moving markets
9177591 the markets are not going to be happy with an obama presidency and mccain is not particularly loved by wall street either
9177592 its going to be a positive influence on economic activity
9177593 that premise of additional supplies is going to further take the speculators out of the market and cause them to put downward pressure
9177594 bronson arroyo does that whenever someone has a great game
9177595 i looked up at the scoreboard when i was in the outfield and it was nice to see that 11
9177596 edinson didnt have his best night but it was one of those nights where we put together great at bats and helped him out a little
9177597 the way the new ballparks are being built and even some of the old ones its very difficult to put yourself in position when youre 350 feet away to see something
9177598 with the green monster in boston you have to be a giraffe to see that top ledge
9177599 i cant put myself in position within a couple of seconds to perfectly see something like that a play at the plate or a play at first base i can
9177600 with the technology over the last four or five years i kind of saw it coming at least for these types of calls
9177601 i hope it doesnt become anything more than boundary calls
9177602 in spring training he looked like he had a good arm and very good stuff
9177603 reds personnel told me hes one of those guys who starts slow and finishes strong so what you saw then is probably not what youll see now
9177604 we are happy for the title and i hope more success will come in the future
9177605 the victory makes anna part of the hungarian olympic team for the chess olympiad in dresden 2008
9177606 im looking at him her infant son who has down syndrome right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9177607 as i understand it this born infants alive act puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing the procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to thing that its nonviable and theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call in a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved i suspect and my impression is is that the medical society suspects as well that doctors feel that they would be under that obligation that they would already be making these determinations and that essentially adding a an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion
9177608 one time a guy in my small group announced rather loudly my life was better before i became a christian everyone kind of gasped but i said of course it was in the past this guy had been honest with our group and we all knew that he had a pattern of sin he was unwilling to give up i said to him before you became a christian because of your sin your life was dark chaotic and messy it wasnt good but for you it was normal since youve become a christian you still have that same sin in your life and so your life is still the same the difference now is that you have jesus in your life trying to lead you into the chaos of that sin to deal with it to understand whats causing it why you feel like you need it and to let it go he loves you so he wont give up on you and hes continually trying to lead you in that direction but youre continually struggling against him so now your life is dark chaotic and messy and you have this constant struggle against jesus so of course your life was better before you became a christian

9177612 the bill is a tribute to my dear friend tom lantos who worked tirelessly on behalf of human rights for the people of burma and stood by them throughout their long struggle for democratic civilian rule
9177613 we must continue toms work working together with the international community including the association of southeast asian nations asean the eu india and china i look forward to the day when a democratic peaceful burma will be fully integrated into the community of nations
9177614 as far as i know the us government knows that they need to have dialogue with the burmese junta
9177615 but whether the us policy on burma changes doesnt just depend on the new men in the us administration we also need to be aware that burmese lobby groups are quite strong in washington
9177616 the violent crackdown on unarmed civilians is a great tragedy the international community must work together to end almost two decades of disastrous military dictatorship in burma and promote the peaceful transition to civilian rule
9177617 if joe biden becomes the us vice president i think it will be a good thing for the people of burma
9177618 it does highlight the fact that they the burmese people live under one of the most excessive and repressive regimes in the world we also need to put more pressure on this illegal corrupt government in burma to make them change
9177619 a family is a place where minds come in contact with one another if these minds love one another the home will be as beautiful as a flower garden but if these minds get out of harmony with one another it is like a storm that plays havoc with the garden
9177620 he also opposed letting people use a self defense argument if charged with violating local handgun bans by using weapons in their homes the bill was a reaction to a chicago area man who after shooting an intruder was charged with a handgun violation

9177729 we hope the government will be less inclined to prosecute american muslim nonprofits and mosques for supporting terrorist causes if they demonstrate that they meet the highest standards of legal compliance financial accountability and good governance
9177730 useful first step toward keeping muslim charities from being shut down
9177731 fundamental change requires a change in the governments basic approach to interpreting the law
9177732 in order to preserve the rights of all nonprofit organizations and indeed the rights of all people all levels of government must conduct their counterterrorism activities in a way that consistently protects liberty and civil society otherwise americans and others lose safeguards that were designed to protect us all from creeping tyranny
9177733 constraining the critical activities of the charitable and philanthropic sectors stifling free speech and ultimately impeding the fight against terrorism
9177734 u s counterterrorism laws have made it increasingly difficult for u s based organizations to operate overseas for example after the 2004 tsunami u s organizations operating in areas controlled by the tamil tigers a designated terrorist organization risked violating prohibitions against material support when creating displaced persons camps and hospitals traveling or distributing food and water
9177735 conduits for terrorist funding and a breeding ground for aggressive dissent
9177736 congress has not utilized its oversight powers to review counterterrorism programs
9177737 operates in fear of what may spark the government to use its power to shut them down

9177798 the press vs al gore how lazy reporting pack journalism and gop spin cost him the election
9177799 aphorism of the week arts not a game it has no rules
9177800 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
9177801 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood whos a professor of english in chicago who i know and who i have not received some official endorsement from hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis and the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george the fact is that im also friendly with tom coburn one of the most conservative republicans in the united states senate who during his campaign once said that it might be appropriate to apply the death penalty to those who carried out abortions do i need to apologize for mr coburns statements because i certainly dont agree with those either
9177802 in the mid 1990s ayers and dohrn hosted a meet and greet at their house to introduce obama to their neighbors during his first run for the illinois senate in 2001 ayers contributed 200 to obamas campaign ayers also served alongside obama between december 1999 and december 2002 on the board of the not for profit woods fund of chicago that board met four times a year and members would see each other at occasional dinners the group hosted
9177803 when i first met barack obama he was giving a standard innocuous little talk in the living room of those two legends in their own minds bill ayers and bernardine dohrn
9177804 they were launching him introducing him to the hyde park community as the best thing since sliced bread
9177805 confession time i too have eaten dinner at bill ayerss house more than once and have served with him on a committee and he was one of those who recruited my wife and me at a reception when we were considering positions at the university of illinois chicago moreover i have had bill and his wife bernardine dohrn to my apartment was a guest lecturer in a course he taught and joined in a successful effort to persuade him to stay at uic and say no to an offer from harvard of course im not running for anything but i do write for the new york times and who knows this association with former fugitive members of the weathermen might be enough in the eyes of some to get me canned did i conspire with bill ayers did i help him build bombs did i aid and abet his evasion for a time of justice not likely given that at the time of the events that brought ayers and dohrn to public attention i was a supporter of the vietnam war i havent asked him to absolve me of that sin of which i have since repented and he hasnt asked me to forgive him for his if he has any
9177806 so this kind of game in which anybody who i know regardless of how flimsy the relationship is that somehow their ideas could be attributed to me i think the american people are smarter than that
9177807 he served his country and he did a good job as a serviceman i will honour him for that but he is not presidential material
9177808 we wanted the junkets at the roosevelt because of its ghostly reputation but we got so much more than we bargained for a photoshoot we prepared was wrecked and two runners say they saw the figure of a lady in the full length mirror
9177809 the final straw came when a production assistant stayed in the room earmarked for ricky and claimed to have been freezing cold on the hottest day of the year he said he woke up with someone whistling in his ear even though he was alone then heard a giggle before being pushed out of bed

9177813 after the live aid set there were no congratulatory hugs or smiles it was as if we were foreign from each other this would be the last time we played together in two decades
9177814 constant bickering and hostility had left the atmosphere acrid with tension we were tired of the incendiary arguments the dark depressions the bitter resentments we were tired of the 24 hour attention
9177815 i just read a quote from gordon ramsay if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her
9177816 but even that i would forgive because its not my affair its not up to me if he talks stupid or not
9177817 id be happier if everyone was vegetarian the planet would be better off for it
9177818 we should disclose that the band has been going through some hard times recently both as a band and as individuals working on the new record was the final breaking point for an already unstable band

9177820 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
9177821 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
9177822 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway

9177826 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9177827 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9177828 the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9177829 many americans who received tax rebates are spending them businesses are taking advantage of tax incentives to purchase new equipment this year and there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9177830 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9177831 our focus is really on this side of the river
9177832 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9177833 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in

9177846 i think the talent is there the quality is there its just a question of confidence the new players settling in
9177847 it is a tough competition as there are sides in it who should be playing in the champions league
9177848 harry takes all competitions seriously and he will need a strong side we have not got the biggest squad so it is important to get the balance right
9177849 legend has it that shani dev who visited gokul dham on learning about lord krishnas birth was denied to have a glimpse of the newborn by his mother yashodha but later when krishna became a young man he personally arrived at this place to give shani dev a personal audience with him

9177851 this temple needs proper management so that more tourists could come here without facing discomfort it is disturbing for any religious minded to see a holy place in such a neglected state due to bad local arrangement

9177875 i knew the first time i saw this team that that was an issue
9177876 our job as coaches is to immediately correct that practice habits and if we continue to do that during the season by the time we get to november we can be a good football team we are not the most talented team in the league by any stretch of the imagination but we have enough talent to be a good football team and when you are a good football team you can carry the game to the fourth quarter and find a way to win games

9177981 gunns statement to the stock exchange rings a final bell on its proposed pulp mill in the tamar valley
9177982 demonstrably he has destroyed shareholder value and the board has failed to keep the market properly informed
9177983 when wal king said recently that the project was dead gunns responded by stating that he was misinformed gunns new statement makes it clear wal king was well informed
9177984 the gunns pulp mill is dead with no money no supply or price certainty no plan of action the tasmanian and federal government should put gunns and its long suffering shareholders out of their misery now
9177985 gunns is working towards a financing structure which will not require additional equity to be raised by gunns shareholders
9177986 the process with potential equity parties will take a period of time to work through and gunns does not expect the financing plan to be finalised before the first quarter of 2009
9177987 the financing structure is yet to be finalised and gunns cannot say with any certainty that such a structure will be achievable nor can it provide an assurance that the mill project proceed
9177988 power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years

9177991 if the political will were there of course it can be done
9177992 weve built up a certain energy infrastructure over the course of 100 years
9177993 its hard to imagine how we would fundamentally redo it over the course of the next ten

9178000 pc cockburns first aid expertise almost certainly saved this mans life to all intents and purposes the man was dead when pc cockburn first saw him
9178001 they were approached by a car driven by a man whose father was unconscious in the passenger seat
9178002 the man was immediately removed from the car and it was established that there were no vital signs
9178003 pc cockburn carried out mouth to mouth resuscitation until the ambulance arrived
9178004 we were tracking robbery suspects and we ended up going into the woods and we ended up with him catching his leg in i think it was glass but could have been some type of debris
9178005 he got an artery cut and he was bleeding really bad
9178006 when i saw the bleeding actually jay cohen pointed it out to me i picked him up carried him to the car i have a first aid bag that i keep in my car i took a compress and pressed it on the wound
9178007 they did wonders for him and got right in there and sewed him right up and took care of him
9178008 but then they thought he was going to go into shock because of the blood loss but he pulled through i was a little nervous but hes going to be fine
9178009 sincere congratulations to the officer canine teams john zavalick and axel stephen grossi and odin and todd mona and primo on their tremendous effort at the k 9 olympics
9178010 our families number one you know the dogs ruin our houses
9178011 and we certainly couldnt do it without the support of our k9 unit and that is run by lieutenant todd hanlon who reaches to us all the time whatever you guys need
9178012 when i leave my family every morning they can be relatively sure i will be safe in my little air conditioned office while officers like you get up every day and go to your jobs and your families have to worry about you come home at the end of your shifts i thank you for all of your service
9178013 you are an outstanding group of men and we thank you from the bottom of our heart
9178014 it breaks my heart and breaks his heart to see me go
9178015 when he sees me leaving he still thinks its his time to go to work

9178018 all the artists on minus came to the label through different paths
9178019 the funny thing is all of the guys in the family grew up through the early plus 8 and plastikman parties
9178020 the whole team attended these early plastikman hawtin parties and became inspired to get deeper into music
9178021 between all of us now its like there is this feedback loop between being inspired and inspiring
9178022 magda came into the scene through the early parties in detroit
9178023 i remember seeing her dj and feeling her amazing presence behind the decks
9178024 artists need a tangible unique quality a personality and magda had it right at the beginning of her career even when she was playing in the early days
9178025 troy started out as a photographer and hes always been a creative guy
9178026 hes a risk taker and enjoys taking a chance but hes also got this dark edge to him that reminds me of the early plastikman records
9178027 that dark side can be heard in all of his productions as well as during his dj sets
9178028 jesse was friends with magda and her posse and while we were all living in nyc together he started passing me demos
9178029 i remember hearing his music and being blown away all his tracks were off kilter and always had some sort of quirky hook to them
9178030 jesse is a funny quirky guy and his music is the same
9178031 theres always something tongue in cheek about his tracks making you not sure if hes serious or not
9178032 we knew each other but he was into a slightly different side of electro pop and new wave plus he was a bit of a freak
9178033 magda then introduced me to him and suddenly we found out we had a lot more in common than we thought
9178034 houles music has got this pop sensibility and even in his most basic most minimal tracks theres always some hook to be found
9178035 gaiser was around for years helping to put up lights and decorate at our detroit parties
9178036 in the beginning i think he was just a fan who wanted to help out
9178037 one day he gave me this demo and usually the demos i receive arent that solid but johns music fitted perfectly with the direction that minus was heading
9178038 actors like kamal haasan and rajnikant are larger than life they cannot be accepted in guest roles i can get away with small cameos off beat roles walk on parts anything im playing a 90 year old man in a new film
9178039 therere some actors in this country like amitabh bachchan chiranjeevi kamal haasan and rajnikant who are above success and failure theyre blessed people if you say im one of them then i too am blessed
9178040 jackie chan appears in a major action sequence with me im trying to physically prepare for the role ive already shot for about 150 days for nair san in japan and mongolia
9178041 im the first actor from malayalam cinema to feature in a japanese film ive to speak not only in japanese but also in chinese and mongolian
9178042 nair was an indian freedom fighter ive met the man he owns a chain of restaurants ive been to his restaurant in tokyo and he has been to my home in kerala
9178043 he passed away at the age of 85 86 i feel very privileged to be playing nair the film will definitely get wide release in japan
9178044 i can tell you that ibsen at this point of time couldnt be done in any other language but malayalam im fortunate to have done it as an actor its my job to do the best of the roles i get however the roles have to come to me i cant go after the roles
9178045 it was the director k p kumarans dream for 20 years he had been pursuing me for 15 years to do a screen adaptation of ibsens play i finally agreed
9178046 ibsens the master builder is a complicated play ive done stage plays including a play in sanskrit but ibsen is tough however i treated the film like any other i play an architect changes were made for example my characters norwegian name was changed for the indian audience

9178056 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base

9178058 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges shes the complete package
9178059 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9178060 mccain is saying to social and religious conservatives im taking your views incredibly seriously
9178061 weve probably had 4 000 to 5 000 e mails
9178062 theres no way to measure the calls the only thing i can tell you about the calls is that from about 7 30 p m to about midnight that night the phone calls did not stop coming in
9178063 we have five or six phone lines and they were lit up the entire night
9178064 they were all using the same talking points that were sent out in the original obama e mail they were all the same boilerplate e mails
9178065 i got the feeling they were trying to intimidate us
9178066 i definitely think that directing the phone calls and the e mails of supporters was definitely an attempt not to shut us down but to intimidate us
9178067 tonight wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
9178068 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
9178069 they were trying to keep me from going on the air
9178070 the following day about noon when i got into the office that day i called the obama campaign let them know that we were going to be having stanley kurtz on the show and offered them a chance to come on the show as well to rebut anything that he said
9178071 we do one topic for the entire two hours and we offered the obama campaign a chance to be on for the entire two hours as well sort of a debate format if you will
9178072 the obama campaigns response was this guy is a liar if you want to talk about the annenberg challenge hes not the guy you want i cant believe that youre going to give this guy a forum
9178073 and i said thats why we want you on the air as well to give your side of the story so he asked who the program manager was on wgn so i told him and gave him the number thats when he hung up on me
9178074 which in my over 30 years experience with the program has never happened before
9178075 i am disgusted that wgn is giving two hours to a vicious racist crackpot i didnt know that ph ds from harvard turned out that way very often kurtz is tied to that vile traitor bill krystol spelled k r y s t o l why are you providing a platform to this character assassin
9178076 do you have a regulator like that fcc where i can file a complaint about the lack of balance since my understanding is that there is no opportunity for the obama campaign to present their correct version of events
9178077 the obama campaign accused me the previous night when i was on greta van susterens show on the fox news channel of telling a flat out lie in their words that obama got his job on the board of the annenberg challenge from ayers
9178078 we do have evidence that points in that direction that ayers must have had some involvement but we cant know it yet as a fact and i said that very clearly on the milt rosenberg show and when i was on greta i did not state it as a certain fact
9178079 each of them headed the two wings of this foundation for a number of years so they had to have some kind of working relationship ayers couldnt have been just a guy in my neighborhood as obama has claimed
9178080 thank you so much for your interview request it is now in our system and our communications team will follow up with you when we have a better idea of your requests status we understand the difficulties a delay in response may cause and certainly appreciate your patience

9178084 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9178085 obama claims to be an anti war candidate when he really is just a new face on the war on terror that bush has locked into place
9178086 hes pledged pre emptive war on iran and on pakistan hes not an anti war candidate hes pledged 14 000 more troops to the war in afghanistan and wants to keep 80 000 troops in iraq
9178087 i argued for more resources and troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
9178088 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
9178089 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain

9178092 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9178093 the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state
9178094 obama also believes we need to fully repeal the defense of marriage act and enact legislation that would ensure that the 1 100 federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same sex couples in civil unions and other legally recognized unions
9178095 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
9178096 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
9178097 that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade

9178099 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
9178100 we will protect americans second amendment right to own firearms and we will keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists by fighting gun crime reauthorizing the assault weapons ban and closing the gun show loophole as president bush proposed and failed to do
9178101 obama will work to ban racial profiling and eliminate disparities in criminal sentencing
9178102 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures

9178224 there is a need for a framework in which the market will operate and that framework includes regulations that define market practices and have some oversight of them
9178225 the senator would encourage private firms to develop a best practice model and industry self regulation if that is insufficient you would want to give the authority to an oversight body such as the fcc to write standards of information sharing and give them the authority to enforce it and as a last step to try and codify it in statutory language which has the disadvantage of being inflexible

9178281 if you look at the way organisations are developing at the cutting edge its much more small team based collaborative ways of working its very exciting to be doing that running an organisation
9178282 a lot of organisations out there recognise that policymaking has changed the localism agenda means people have to think in different ways about who the players are and where the power lies
9178283 so if youre a company thinktank or charity you have to work in quite different ways
9178284 that changes the way you think about policies in the first place
9178285 you have to build on your strengths were not going to become a film making institute but become more imaginative about how you get your message across
9178286 we have a sense of our niche as an organisation and a confidence in our ability to do good quality work which will help all parties
9178287 so weve gone from a role which is very closely related to one political party and really looking to be one step ahead of where policymakers are whichever political party theyre in and one of the roles of a thinktank is trying to find the space for the thinking its not possible to do whether youre in government or in opposition
9178288 we are committed to changing the world but often that means working with no political parties actually particularly the way power has shifted away from westminster
9178289 we started the game off extremely well and kept going to the end in good fashion
9178290 i was a little surprised that wellington didnt come out fighting after their last result loss to melbourne
9178291 he was a bit slow in the first half he had to get that first goal to get the monkey off his back
9178292 weve got to be better than that there were opportunities for players there tonight and quite frankly they didnt take them
9178293 ill be disappointed if we dont because our performances have been fantastic especially in one day cricket
9178294 we beat the west indies 5 0 and weve come here and won convincingly today
9178295 weve got a fantastic squad weve got so much talent around australia and it doesnt matter who we play every time we walk out to play for australia we expect to win
9178296 it changes every day for our boys they can be wonderful with that minimal footwork and shot playing but they can also be ordinary
9178297 the people back home have built up this series a lot and the players felt that a bit today it looked like they werent up to it mentally
9178298 oh no doubt no doubt no doubt technology should be introduced id like to have a look at that one again
9178299 talking to jason he believed he got kicked in the arm so i certainly would hate to be playing for a top four or top eight spot and have that cost us today it hasnt it mightve cost us the game and thats questionable
9178300 its something the afls got to look at whether its time keepers or whether its goal umpires things you can know that you can get right things you can control youve got to get right
9178301 bit of a hamstring problem it was a bit tight coming over and after a bit of a jog yesterday we thought it wasnt worth the risk
9178302 im here to apologise firstly to our supporters and secondly to shannon grants family and his supporters
9178303 it was a disgraceful effort today and it all comes down to effort required and it was non existent
9178304 that was one of the things that we spoke about all week the effort and again we spoke about last nights game and the effort required and today it was just non existent
9178305 its a mental application and about your desire to work hard within your role and your team role
9178306 weve blown an opportunity to finish fourth but we have another opportunity in the finals
9178307 some of the guys who have served us so well have been on a slippery dip and some of the guys who have performed poorly today and who performed poorly last week make themselves vulnerable
9178308 do we take them edwards and mcintosh into a finals series probably not being match hardened
9178309 thats the question we have to look very closely at and pick the best side to win a final
9178310 its important to be able to realign yourself refocus and get yourself ready
9178311 we got absolutely smashed in free kicks around the stoppages
9178312 were not blaming anyone were just saying its a fact we need to spend more time with the umpiring department because i think we have had 90 free kicks the wrong way this year
9178313 its so hard to play for this team in my opinion we are the greatest sporting team in the world and we have standards
9178314 they may be higher than other teams but if you dont fulfil those standards unfortunately youre not going to be a part of our squad
9178315 the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team
9178316 in my opinion and the rest of the leadership groups opinion you need to be committed 100 per cent to all facets of being an international cricketer
9178317 he wasnt organised enough to understand his commitments that day
9178318 that to me raises concerns about how and what sort of space he is in in his own mind and thats the discussion we had with him
9178319 this is the type of game clemson seems to lose
9178320 defensively we were very good we were strong contact was great we got forward pretty well
9178321 the try they got from the kick probably highlights the only way they were going to score tonight
9178322 we created a lot of opportunities in the second half but it was probably the final pass that went astray
9178323 it was pretty messy im disappointed with our lack of control of the ball but full credit to the cowboys
9178324 they played a bit of footy they were offloading the ball and the bounce went with them
9178325 we had to defend a lot i think they had 60 per cent of the possession for most of the game and we didnt utilise ours too well
9178326 he didnt say too much hes a humble sort of guy but just his presence in his room everyone went up to shake his hand and it was good to see him in the sheds before everyone ran out
9178327 bedsy was obviously a factor in the game but weve done it for ourselves first and foremost it was the last home game of the year so youre expected to rip in as much as you can
9178328 its right up there with anything for me in terms of the circumstances
9178329 there was a lot of pressure on us to stay in the finals race and get the job done the boys had to handle the fact that our captain and inspirational leader retired last weekend we had disruptions with illness to a couple of our players and they just handled the lot of it not to mention a terrific footy team in melbourne
9178330 cameron smith was pouring down on him and how he got that threaded through and hit it so sweetly under pressure is an enormous thing
9178331 the messages are easy its hard to kick them in the heat of the battle
9178332 its going to be a bit of a struggle now id imagine to win the minor premiership
9178333 we just came out pretty flat tonight and failed to get into the game
9178334 obviously they were pretty determined to send danny out on a winning note and certainly that type of emotion helps a team
9178335 the mri showed he has a pectoral tear and he will be operated on on monday afternoon and he will be out for between 18 and 22 weeks
9178336 from our point of view he will be back for the start of next season which is important for us but its sad for him and the new zealand test side
9178337 we just wanted to make some adjustments there we are using these games to work on our combinations of john sutton and craig wing and halfback chris sandow and isaac luke
9178338 i started the game with wingy at hooker which we havent done since hes been at the club and i thought it worked really well
9178339 we brought isaac off the bench a bit fresher it was just a bit of my having a look at the best combination going forward
9178340 we are using these games to learn a lot over the last few weeks we knew we werent going to be in the semi finals
9178341 but were playing the best teams in the competition and were not turning up and just going through the motions because were going out there and really ripping into them

9178349 im just so enthusiastic and passionate about these ideas i guess that when publishers looked at it they could pick up on that too ask me to write about the history of automobiles and i just couldnt do it even if you were paying me a million dollars
9178350 and i like to sleep in ideally it would be 1 or 2pm but i dont usually allow myself to sleep in that late
9178351 i love the interplay between things that are frivolous and serious for example the rococo era was considered very frivolous but i think there is a lot that can be learned from that now that kawaii is getting more popular in the west i think that it reveals a lot about japanese culture and the reasons why it became popular here the whole hello kitty phenomenon i think down the line well be reading a scholarly text on kawaii
9178352 people who knew me growing up knew me as the goth kid always the one that loved underground culture into strange music from the 60s its just me i consider myself an esthete there were those people like oscar wilde and those in the victorian era such as the dandys who were very flamboyant and out there but at the same time they are joking behind the fa ade they know its a fa ade they play around with it and not taking themselves too serious
9178353 i loved the training of law and i really think it made me really focus and work smart
9178354 but im not passionate about the law the way im passionate about fashion about writing about the creative world
9178355 to quote a fellow bootstrapper i work for no man
9178356 since both book deals came through ill have enough to work on and live on for the next while the creative and entrepreneurial paths are always perilous but i thrive on the thrill and risk the sense of self determination i certainly wouldnt trade them for a comfy corporate office

9178712 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds

9178718 change is invigorating if you dont accept new challenges you become complacent and lazy your life atrophies new experiences lead too new questions amp new solutions change forces us to experiment amp adapt that is how we learn and grow
9178719 en todo aquello que tiene que ver con la defensa del estatuto que es tanto como decir la defensa de andaluc a seremos como siempre exigentes es la posici n que hemos mantenido en todo momento en defensa de los intereses de nuestra comunidad y que no demanda ning n privilegio sino que aspira a mantener una posici n de mutua lealtad institucional

9178728 year s ago it cost 12 000 per person per year today it s just under 500
9178729 because of this we have been able to put an extensive amount of people on medication in 2002 we had only 300 people on medication because of the astronomical cost we must now look at getting the others into care
9178730 albeit 69 percent of all those who have developed full blown aids have died

9178739 promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family
9178740 ours is a promise that says government should do that which we cannot do for ourselves
9178741 that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
9178742 if your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him

9178746 they had poured kerosene on my head and one held a matchbox in his hands to light the fire but thanks to divine providence in the end they did not do that otherwise i would not have been there to tell this horror
9178747 beat us up and led us like culprits along the road
9178748 there they tore my shirt and started pulling off the clothes of the nun when i protested they beat me hard with iron rods later they took the sister inside and raped her while they went on kicking and teasing me forcing me to say vulgar words
9178749 later both of us half naked were taken to the street and they ordered me to have sex with the nun in public saying nuns and priests do it as i refused they went on beating me and dragged us to the nearby government office sadly a dozen policemen were watching all this
9178750 someone bought me a house ive always wanted to live in canada
9178751 marriage and children are the things that women were born for
9178752 then my younger brother gary comes in and catches one that was 5 5kg with the guts in and 4 6kg when weighed in with the guts out
9178753 gary caught it on six pound 2 72kg line and made mine look tiny he said last night he was going to catch the big one and he did we came and camped friday and caught a couple of brownies for dinner but the tagged one is still out there they tell me
9178754 it would be a great tragedy if a 2 billion development was scuttled as a result of a lack of government support
9178755 it was one area of the environment that i thought i could make an immediate impact
9178756 the devil is an iconic australian animal particularly in tasmania so i have a personal interest in how fragile the environment is and the need to preserve the uniqueness of the wildlife so that another animal does not become extinct
9178757 we used to think they made their burrows in hollow logs but weve put logs out and they ignore them theyve dug down under the ground to build their burrows
9178758 im keen to learn about the natural environment and particularly to develop a sense of place where i belong
9178759 its a fantastic attraction for the city and its unique
9178760 its totally unique to tasmania winter or summer its beautiful in summer its a sea of wildflowers and its one of the most amazing sights ive never seen and i hope its one place that will be preserved forever
9178761 thats provided immense pleasure for generations of tasmanian fishermen and it was such a fantastic scientific achievement
9178762 launceston city park is important because of its recognition of colonial botanist ronald campbell gunn and the fact that it was the site of the original governors cottage they planted a pear tree at the time that is still blooming
9178763 and the albert hall because it has been a significant key to launceston all the major functions have taken place there and it has a presence in launceston people come to launceston to look at old buildings like this
9178764 its an iconic company because of the innovation it brought into mining and into tasmania as a whole
9178765 they pioneered hydro electricity with the lake margaret power station built to power the mine and the surrounding area they had one of the first health systems for workers too
9178766 for a long time they had a budget bigger than the tasmanian budget they put the state on the map
9178767 well theres the obvious ones of course port arthur and cradle mountain
9178768 then i think hells gates and macquarie harbour should be on there its a very historically significant place
9178769 the tassie devil would be an iconic tasmanian and the beers would you say the beers perhaps boags and cascade
9178770 youd have to say the big farm down at woolnorth it was set up on a charter from king george
9178771 i think the nut is an icon thats very recognisable all over australia and then weve got the tarkine
9178772 the tarkine will be an icon of australia in the future
9178773 heritage icons has that capacity to range widely across all areas of life
9178774 it will be a really interesting reflection on how tasmanians perceive their own identity
9178775 those things that we consider make us distinctive in many ways relate to our perceptions of heritage whether thats cultural heritage or natural heritage
9178776 and at the end of the day for us its a way of increasing community awareness of how important heritage is in the way we perceive ourselves as tasmanians
9178777 over the years many of microsoft monopolies have been successfully attacked by open source linux on the server apache for web servers firefox for web browsers and so on the one exception and its a big one is business e mail exchange with 65 of the market owns business groupware and e mail
9178778 while cisco is getting ready to smack exchange around theres another open development thats spelling trouble for exchange openchange this project which is being created in partnership with samba is taking exchanges protocols which the european union forced microsoft to reveal will enable any open source groupware developer to create an exchange outlook compatible server

9178780 design can make things easier for the viewer or the user design is not decoration if anything design is more about subtraction than addition visually we do not want to include too much nor do we want to exclude too much
9178781 conventional wisdom says that to beat your competitors you need to one up them if they have four features you need five or 15 or 25 if theyre spending x you need to spend xx if they have 20 you need 30
9178782 a simple design always takes less time to finish than a complex one so always do the simplest thing that could possibly work if you find something that is complex replace it with something simple its always faster and cheaper to replace complex code now before you waste a lot more time on it keep things as simple as possible as long as possible by never adding functionality before it is scheduled beware though keeping a design simple is hard work

9178808 so if researchers are not at the library where are they the most obvious answer is that they are making greater use of digital materials which can make trips to the library much more targeted and focused some recent studies help to validate that impression but also point out a few problems that occur on the path from idea to publication
9178809 e xcellent scholarship should not be excluded from a tenure file simply because the form of its production happens to be electronic
9178810 over the past few years ive had an uncomfortable sense that someone or something has been tinkering with my brain remapping the neural circuitry reprogramming the memory my mind isnt going so far as i can tell but its changing im not thinking the way i used to think i can feel it most strongly when im reading immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy my mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument and id spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose thats rarely the case anymore now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages i get fidgety lose the thread begin looking for something else to do i feel as if im always dragging my wayward brain back to the text the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle
9178811 today i am inaugurating an extended series of posts on the question of how digital scholarship should count in the ways that things count at colleges and universities as more and more scholars do work in the digital environment they are expecting this work to count toward tenure promotion and other types of formal evaluation in the hiring process for instance
9178812 the national coalition for history a leading history advocacy group has come out in support of the electronic message preservation act now pending in the u s house of representatives the bill hr 5811 was introduced by rep henry a waxman of california a democrat who is chairman of the house committee on oversight and reform it would direct the national archives and records administration to establish standards for the capture management preservation and retrieval of federal agency and presidential records in electronic format the coalition said in announcing its support

9178817 the digital humanities represent a scary rule breaking swashbuckling movement for many historians and other scholars we must remember that these scholars have had for generations and still in todays graduate schools a very clear path for how they do their work publish and get rewarded
9178818 the first google index in 1998 already had 26 million pages and by 2000 the google index reached the one billion mark over the last eight years weve seen a lot of big numbers about how much content is really out there recently even our search engineers stopped in awe about just how big the web is these days when our systems that process links on the web to find new content hit a milestone 1 trillion as in 1 000 000 000 000 unique urls on the web at once
9178819 electronic texts give humanists access to works previously difficult to find both in terms of locating entire works with the internet as a distributed interconnected library and in access to the terms and keywords within the works themselves as a first step in analysis
9178820 the real value of studying the common words rests on the fact that they constitute the underlying fabric of a text a barely visible web that gives shape to whatever is being said
9178821 tive chances estava lutando queria muito vencer a partida mas ela jogou de maneira inacredit vel
9178822 this seems like a fitting time to ask if the internet is the most powerful communications advance ever and it is then how do this medium and its new devices affect how and what we read
9178823 so microsoft has left the business of digitizing millions of books apparently because they saw it as no business at all
9178824 the internet represents a potentially radical change to historical research a craft that has changed little for decades if not centuries by aggregating the grass roots knowledge and recollections of hundreds even thousands of people crowdsourcing as its increasingly called may transform a discipline that has long been defined and limited by the labors of a single historian toiling in the dusty archives
9178825 the web offers an instant education on the uses of the past in the present
9178826 digital archives stand as yet another manifestation of new thinking such archives take advantage of the mass multiplicity speed reiteration reflexivity and precision offered by computers

9178873 we believe we have no more judicial options to pursue
9178874 so we may disagree with the foundation there the rationale behind the ruling but our responsibility is to proceed forward with the law and abide by the constitution
9178875 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9178876 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9178877 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9178878 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9178879 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what

9178897 er lag v llig leblos am boden der puls kam nur ganz kurz dann war er wieder weg
9178898 hier geht es auch um menschen hier geht es nicht nur um punkte und siege
9178899 es war gro artig als wir uns trafen er hatte keine ahnung wer ich war
9178900 ich sah nicht wie nicole von den pussycat dolls aus meine haare waren zur ckgebunden und es ging alles ziemlich schnell
9178901 er stand auf und bot mir seinen stuhl an eine frau mag so etwas das ist viel netter als alles andere was ein mann tun kann mit manieren kommt man weit jungs
9178902 wir gehen aus albern herum und genie en das leben warum nicht wir sind beide jung und haben spa ich w rde sagen dass ich nie gl cklicher war
9178903 um ehrlich zu sein ben tigte nelson etwas zeit um sich auf der strecke zurechtzufinden er hatte etwas zu k mpfen fernando schien alles gut im griff zu haben
9178904 fakt ist dass er im ersten qualifying teil nur 0 3 sekunden vom schnellsten entfernt war wir dachten aus diesem grund dass wir im zweiten qualifying teil keine probleme bekommen w rden die runde in valencia ist mit rund 100 sekunden sehr lang da ist es ungew hnlich dass die autos so eng beieinander liegen dort war dies der fall
9178905 wir waren zuversichtlich dass wir am richtigen ende der zeiten stehen und fernando in der lage sein w rde auf seine bliche position um die pl tze sechs oder sieben herum zu kommen
9178906 wenn die zeiten sehr eng beieinander liegen dann kann man es sich nicht leisten einen fehler zu machen und noch schlimmer als einen fehler zu machen ist es sich zwei fehler zu leisten ungl cklicherweise passierte uns dies es ist bei fernando selten dass er fehler macht in beiden qualifying versuchen leistete er sich einen fehler
9178907 unsere software ist ziemlich ausgekl gelt wir sind in der lage diese fehler auszuklammern und zu schauen welche zeit m glich gewesen w re vor den beiden fehlern waren wir jeweils gut in form lagen auf den positionen wo wir uns erwartet hatten wir w ren dadurch ziemlich locker in die folgende einheit gekommen das war dann die geschichte des wochenendes denn das hatte nat rlich seine konsequenzen
9178908 es ist ein kurs der nicht einfach zu lernen ist und nelson arbeitete am samstag noch genau daran
9178909 er arbeitete immer noch daran die strecke kennen zu lernen es ist eine ziemlich schwierige strecke keine in der du in schnellen kurven einfach nur mut haben musst man muss in den kurven in bezug auf den bremspunkt sehr pr zise sein es ist ein kurs der nicht einfach zu lernen ist und nelson arbeitete am samstag noch genau daran
9178910 es gibt nat rlich zwei rennen in spanien und fernando hat die erwartungen und hoffnungen gesp rt stand deshalb unter druck
9178911 es gibt leute die grunds tzlich kommen um fernando zu sehen dass er gut abschneidet es war f r ihn aus diesem grund alles andere als ideal dass er schon in der ersten runde ausschied er muss entt uscht sein es war ja auch kein fehler den er gemacht hat er wurde von hinten getroffen
9178912 wir h tten f nf minuten ben tigt um das zu reparieren
9178913 wir h tten das reparieren k nnen aber man muss abw gen inwiefern man zockt und auf ein gutes ergebnis hofft
9178914 er hatte eine ziemlich ereignisreiche erste runde wurde durch alonsos zwischenfall behindert er musste durch die tr mmer teile von alonso fahren
9178915 in kurve 17 berholte er coulthard und ber hrte ihn dabei was die front seines autos besch digte er hatte dadurch ein aerodynamisches defizit in den letzten runden des rennens fuhr er ziemlich konkurrenzf hig er fuhr dort die zeiten des mittelfelds aber man kann nicht erwarten dass man irgendetwas erreicht wenn man sich so weit hinten im feld qualifiziert man muss auf einer strecke aufpassen auf der es schwierig ist zu berholen
9178916 au erdem hat mein team hat einen tollen job gemacht weil ich immer allein auf der strecke war ich hatte nie verkehr und das kann auf dieser kleinen strecke sehr schnell passieren ich habe zudem meinen fahrstil in ein paar kurven verbessert das hat auch geholfen
9178917 ja man wei nie ob es noch mal eine gibt und wer wei wie die strecke nach der gelbphase wird vielleicht ist staub drauf die strecke kann durch solche unterbrechungen immer schlechter werden aber es war ziemlich konstant es war nicht die optimale situation aber es war f r alle dasselbe und das wichtigste war dass wir das beste herausholen
9178918 es stehen nur noch vier rennen aus und es ist definitiv zeit aufzuwachen
9178919 nat rlich es stehen nur noch vier rennen aus und es ist definitiv zeit aufzuwachen
9178920 in der dtm kann noch so viel passieren ich stehe auf platz zwei wir haben ein gutes auto f r das rennen sind gute longruns gefahren ich werde am start mein bestes geben und w hrend des rennens voll pushen
9178921 es wird schwer auf dieser strecke zu berholen ganz ehrlich ich glaube dass es hier fast keine m glichkeit dazu gibt vielleicht wenn einer einen gro en fehler macht
9178922 wir werden sehen wer der fitteste ist und keine fehler macht
9178923 wenn man allein und schnell f hrt dann kann man viele pl tze gut machen im vergangenen jahr ist zum beispiel bernd schneider als sechster gestartet war immer allein auf der strecke und hat gewonnen allerdings wird auch das mit den boxenstoppfenstern nicht so einfach aber ein bisschen was ist schon m glich
9178924 man darf keine fehler machen denn es wird f r alle ein sehr sehr langes rennen wir werden sehen wer der fitteste ist und keine fehler macht
9178925 und wer wei wie das wetter wird da kann noch viel passieren
9178926 das w re ja eine truppe gro m tter wenn sie berm ig vorsichtig w ren
9178927 meiner meinung nach k nnen sie eine strecke so schnell lernen dass sie kommendes jahr nicht hierher kommen und denken dass sie hier und dort etwas falsch gemacht oder anders machen k nnen dieses mal etwas abenteuerlustiger sein k nnen
9178928 ich freue mich f r meine mechaniker wir sind wieder dabei in ungarn lief es berhaupt nicht gut das ist sehr ermutigend und ich hoffe auf weitere siege ich brauche weitere wichtige punkte f r die meisterschaftswertung
9178929 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous

9178938 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner
9178939 that is a matter for him to reconcile with what he considers to be his proper responsibilities as one of this countrys most senior police officers

9178961 putaria uma casa de shows como o oasis tem alvar de funcionamento todo fim de semana o que deve ter acontecido foi uma reclama o de algum morador das redondezas visto que a rea residencial problema de extintor n o deve ter sido pois teria sido algo bem mais s ria culminando at na interdi o do local por falta de estrutura

9178970 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
9178971 tensions between russia and the west were ratcheted even higher today after moscow warned that the american naval build up in the black sea could be seen as a declaration of war
9178972 normally battleships do not deliver aid and this is battleship diplomacy this does not make the situation more stable
9178973 despite the apparent strength of the nato naval group in the black sea a single salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or thee missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group within twenty minutes the waters would be clear

9178982 the love for justice that is in us is not only the best part of our being it is also the most true to our nature
9178983 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience
9178984 freedom is not simply the right of intellectuals to circulate their merchandise
9178985 you can safely assume youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do

9178988 it isnt that liberals are ignorant its just that they know so much that isnt so
9178989 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule
9178990 the right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously
9178991 a liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel
9178992 the only truly consistent man is he who will for the sake of being right today contradict what he said wrong yesterday
9178993 im having a lot of anxiety and that worries me
9178994 man is not disappointed by that which happens rather he is disappointed by his perception of that which happens

9179001 while we are free to do whatever we wish we are not free to have the consequences be whatever we want them to be
9179002 one of the many failings of our educational system is that it sends out into the world people who cannot tell rhetoric from reality
9179003 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
9179004 every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world
9179005 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort
9179006 sin can play a big role in making and keeping us humble a contrite spirit is desired by god in order for me to be contrite i must embrace the good and the bad in me and not take either too seriously
9179007 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
9179008 fanatacism consists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim

9179014 its actually just a couple of our guys being silly wearing wet t shirts
9179015 people are tired of that instead of pointing fingers at what our culture is doing we want to be real and talk about who we are in here
9179016 we have a lot of evidence and the connection between so many cases of dna will allow us to eventually solve this
9179017 this is the mind of a maniac but we have a tight victim profile and powerful evidence that has taken us across the country
9179018 the victims are the most vulnerable in society and we know the suspect is involved in prostitution eventually we will find him

9179080 the downside is that 9 times out of 10 its completely useless because its almost impossible to read or its a really bizarre picture of a naked lady thats not clickable

9179084 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
9179085 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
9179086 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality
9179087 when i write i feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth

9179089 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
9179090 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
9179091 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
9179092 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative

9179107 after all this they are still my brothers i wish them the best
9179108 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat

9179141 dialah yang menjadikan matahari bersinar dan bulan bercahaya dan ditetapkan manzilah manzilah bagi perjalanan bulan itu supaya kamu mengetahui bilangan tahun dan perhitungan waktu
9179142 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal apabila pandangan kalian tersamar terhalang maka sempurnakanlah hitungan bulan syaban menjadi 30 hari
9179143 janganlah kalian puasa hingga melihat hilal jangan pula kalian berbuka hingga melihatnya jika kalian terhalangi awan hitunglah bulan syaban
9179144 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya
9179145 puasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan ruyat hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
9179146 sesungguhnya bulan itu ada 29 hari maka janganlah kalian berpuasa hingga melihatnya apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka perkirakanlah
9179147 untuk itu mengamalkan dalil yang lebih khusus adalah kewajiban dan lebih utama penganut hisab menetapkan keabsahan hisab bersandar kepada
9179148 sesungguhnya kami ini adalah ummat yang ummi tidak menulis dan menghisab
9179149 sesungguhnya bulan itu ada 29 hari maka janganlah kalian berpuasa hingga melihatnya apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka perkirakanlah
9179150 disini artinya hitunglah yakni bolehnya menetapkan awal ramadhan dengan hisab
9179151 maka kita harus melihat konteks hadits tersebut secara utuh dan membandingkan dengan nash nash hadits lainnya jika kita perhatikan nash nash hadits lain dapat disimpulkan bahwa
9179152 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal apabila pandangan kalian tersamar terhalang maka sempurnakanlah hitungan bulan syaban menjadi 30 hari
9179153 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya
9179154 berpuasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal maka apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka sempurnakanlah hitungan menjadi tiga puluh hari
9179155 berpuasalah karena melihat bulan dan berbuka puasalah karena melihat bulan jika mendung maka perkirakanlah faqdurulah bulan syaban 30 hari
9179156 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal apabila pandangan kalian tersamar terhalang maka sempurnakanlah hitungan bulan syaban menjadi 30 hari
9179157 berpuasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal maka apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka sempurnakanlah hitungan menjadi tiga puluh hari
9179158 lafadz ini dengan jelas menunjukkan bahwa ruyat dalam nash tersebut berarti melihat dengan mata telanjang bukan hisab sebab bila lafadz
9179159 yang dimaksud dengan hisab dalam hadits ini adalah hisabun nujum perhitungan ilmu falak dan peredarannya
9179160 hr bukhari seperti penjelasan imam ibnu hajar hadits ini menceritakan bahwa rasulullah saw tidak melakukan hisab oleh karena itu bagaimana bisa dikatakan bahwa tafsir
9179161 apabila ruyatul hilal telah terbukti terlihat di salah satu negeri maka negeri negeri yang lain juga wajib berpuasa
9179162 namun bila kita bandingkan riwayat riwayat lain yang juga diriwayatkan oleh ibnu abbas sendiri maka terlihatlah bahwa perkataan ibnu abbas itu adalah hasil ijtihad beliau sendiri
9179163 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal apabila pandangan kalian tersamar terhalang maka sempurnakanlah hitungan bulan syaban menjadi 30 hari
9179164 sabda beliau ini tidaklah dikhususkan untuk penduduk satu daerah tertentu tanpa menyertakan daerah yang lain
9179165 ucapan ini umum mencakup seluruh ummat manusia jadi siapa saja dari mereka melihat hilal dimanapun tempatnya maka ruyat itu berlaku bagi mereka semuanya 16
9179166 makna dari ucapan karena melihatnya yaitu apabila ruyat didapati diantara kalian hal ini menunjukkan bahwa ruyat pada suatu negeri adalah ruyat bagi semua penduduk negeri dan hukumnya wajib
9179167 para shahabat ra tidak memerintahkan suatu negeri untuk mengikuti hasil ruyat penduduk madinah syam mesir maghrib dan sebagainya
9179168 hilal bulan syawal tertutup oleh mendung bagi kami sehingga kami tetap berpuasa pada keesokan harinya
9179169 telah datang seorang arab badui kepada nabi muhammad saw kemudian berkata
9179170 sesungguhnya nabi saw menggantungkan perkara puasa dan ied fithri dengan sesuatu yang tampak
9179171 jika kalian melihatnya seperti kalian melihat matahari maka bersaksilah namun jika tidak maka tinggalkanlah
9179172 puasalah kalian karena melihat hilal berbukalah karena melihatnya berhajilah karena melihatnya jika kalian tertutup mendung sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika ada dua saksi berpuasalah kalian dan berbukalah
9179173 manusia mencari cari hilal maka aku kabarkan kepada nabi saw bahwa aku melihatnya rasulullah saw pun menyuruh manusia berpuasa
9179174 puasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan ruyat hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
9179175 berpuasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal maka apabila mendung menutupi kalian maka sempurnakanlah hitungan menjadi tiga puluh hari
9179176 dan orang yang berpijak pada hisab dalam menentukan hilal sebagaimana ia sesat dalam syariat iapun telah berbuat bidah dalam agama dia telah salah dalam hal akal dan ilmu hisab
9179177 nantinya penguasa ini yang dalam fiqh siyasah disebut khalifah berkewajiban mengadopsi
9179178 wahai manusia sesungguhnya diri dirimu tergadai karena amal amalmu maka bebaskanlah dengan istighfar punggung punggungmu berat karena beban dosamu maka ringankanlah dengan memperpanjang sujudmu ketahuilah allah swt bersumpah dengan segala kebesaran nya bahwa dia tiada akan mengazab orang orang yang shalat dan sujud dan tiada akan mengancam mereka pada hari manusia berdiri dihadapan rabbulalamiin
9179179 wahai manusia barangsiapa diantara kamu memberi buka kepada orang orang mukmin yang berpuasa di bulan ini maka disisi allah swt nilainya sama dengan membebaskan budak dan dia diberi ampunan atas dosa dosanya yang telah lalu sahabat bertanya
9179180 wahai manusia sesungguhnya pintu pintu surga dibukakan untukmu maka mintalah kepada rabb mu agar tidak pernah menutupkannya
9179181 betapa banyak orang orang yang berpuasa tidak mendapatkan balasan kecuali lapar dan haus
9179182 sesungguhnya dia puasa itu untuk ku dan aku akan membalasnya dia anak adam meninggalkan syahwat dan makanannya karena ku
9179183 di masa rasulullah saw beliau memerintahkan orang orang berpuasa selama satu hari
9179184 kedua wanita ini berpuasa terhadap makanan yang dihalalkan allah tetapi membatalkan puasanya itu dengan perbuatan yang diharamkan oleh nya mereka duduk bersantai sambil menggunjingkan orang orang lain maka itulah daging daging mereka yang dipergunjingkan
9179185 orang yang menggunjing dan mendengarkan gunjingan keduanya bersekutu dalam perbuatan dosa
9179186 mereka itu adalah orang orang yang suka mendengar berita dusta dan banyak memakan yang haram
9179187 hai orang orang yang beriman jauhilah kebanyakan dari prasangka sesungguhnya sebagian prasangka itu adalah dosa dan janganlah kamu mencari cari kesalahan orang lain dan janganlah sebahagian kamu menggunjing sebahagian yang lain
9179188 puasa adalah perisai tabir penghalang dari perbuatan dosa maka apabila seseorang dari kamu sedang berpuasa janganlah ia mengucapkan sesuatu yang keji dan janganlah ia berbuat jahil
9179189 lima hal yang dapat membatalkan puasa berkata dusta ghibah menggunjing memfitnah sumpah dusta dan memandang dengan syahwat
9179190 barangsiapa yang tidak dapat meninggalkan perkataan kotor dan dusta selama berpuasa maka allah s w t tidak berhajat kepada puasanya
9179191 orang yang menggunjing dan mendengarkan gunjingan keduanya bersekutu dalam perbuatan dosa
9179192 berapa banyak orang yang berpuasa namun tidak didapatkan dari puasanya itu kecuali haus dan lapar
9179193 berapa banyak orang yang berpuasa namun ia tidak mendapatkan dari puasanya itu selain lapar dan haus sebab puasa itu bukanlah semata mata menahan lapar dan haus akan tetapi adalah menahan hawa nafsu boleh jadi orang tersebut berdusta menggunjing dan memandang dengan syahwat sehingga yang demikian itu membatalkan hakikat puasa
9179194 betapa banyak orang yang berpuasa padahal ia berbuka tidak berpuasa dan betapa banyak orang yang berbuka padahal ia berpuasa
9179195 sesungguhnya puasa itu adalah amanah maka hendaknya masing masing kamu menjaga amanahnya
9179196 makan sahurlah kalian sesungguhnya di dalam sahur itu terdapat berkah
9179197 bantulah kekuatan fisikmu untuk berpuasa di siang hari dengan makan sahur dan untuk shalat malam dengan tidur siang
9179198 manusia senantiasa dalam kebaikan selama mereka menyegerakan berbuka dan mengakhirkan sahur
9179199 barangsiapa tidak meninggalkan perkataan dan perbuatan dusta maka allah tidak butuh terhadap puasanya dari makan dan minum
9179200 puasa adalah perisai bila suatu hari seseorang dari kama beupuasa hendaknya ia tidak bevkata buruk dan berteriak teriak bila seseorang menghina atau mencacinya hendaknya ia berkata sesungguhnya aku sedang puasa
9179201 jika kamu berpuasa hendaknya berpuasa pula pendengaranmu penglihatanmu dan lisanmu dari dusta dan dosa dosa tinggalkan menyakiti tetangga dan hendaknya kamu senantiasa bersikap tenang pada hari kamu berpuasa jangan pula kamu jadikan hari berbukamu sama dengan hari kamu berpuasa

9179211 hr ibnu khuzaimah dan ia menshahihkan hadits ini al baihaqi dan lainnya
9179212 tuhan kami yang mahasuci dan maha tinggi turun pada setiap malam ke langit dunia yaitu ketika masih berlangsung sepertiga malam yang akhir seraya berfirman
9179213 ya allah bulan ramadhan telah menaungi kami dan telah hadir maka serahkanlah ia kepada kami dan serahkanlah kami kepadanya
9179214 ya allah serahkanlah aku kepada ramadhan dan serahkan ramadhan kepadaku dan engkau menerimanya daripadaku dengan rela
9179215 bila masuk sepuluh hari terakhir bulan ramadhan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam mengencangkan kainnya menjauhkan diri dari menggauli istrinya menghidupkan malamnya dan membangunkan keluarganya
9179216 menghidupkan malam nya membangunkan keluarganya dan bersungguh sungguh serta mengencangkan kainnya
9179217 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam bersungguh sungguh dalam sepuluh hari akhir bulan ramadhan hal yang tidak beliau lakukan pada bulan lainnya
9179218 aku tidak pernah mengetahui rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam shalat malam hingga pagi
9179219 barangsiapa mendapati ramadhan dalam keadaan sehat dan sebagai orang muslim lalu puasa pada siang harinya dan melakukan shalat pada sebagian malamnya juga menundukkan pandangannya menjaga kemaluan lisan dan tangannya serta menjaga shalatnya secara berjamaah dan bersegera berangkat untuk shalat jumat sungguh ia telah puasa sebulan penuh menerima pahala yang sempurna mendapatkan lailatul qadar serta beruntung dengan hadiah dari tuhan yang mahasuci dan maha tinggi
9179220 abu ja far berkata hadiah yang tidak serupa dengan hadiah hadiah para penguasa hr ibnu abid dunya
9179221 bahwasanya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasalam melakukan shalat bersama mereka para sahabat pada malam dua puluh tiga 23 dua puluh lima 25 dan dua puluh tujuh 27 dan disebutkan bahwasanya beliau mengajak shalat keluarga dan isteri isterinya pada malam dua puluh tujuh 27 saja
9179222 bahwasanya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam membangunkan keluarganya pada sepuluh akhir dari bulan ramadhan dan setiap anak kecil maupun orang tua yang mampu melakukan shalat
9179223 bahwasanya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam mengetuk pintu fathimah dan ali radhiallahu anhuma pada suatu malam seraya berkata tidakkah kalian bangun lalu mendirikan shalat
9179224 dan perintahkanlah kepada keluargamu mendirikan shalat dan bersabarlah kamu dalam mengerjakannya
9179225 dan beliau melipat tempat tidurnya dan menjauhi isteri isterinya tidak menggauli mereka
9179226 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam jika bulan ramadhan seperti biasa tidur dan bangun dan manakala memasuki sepuluh hari terakhir beliau mengencangkan kainnya dan menjauhkan diri dari menggauli isteri isterinya serta mandi antara maghrib dan isya
9179227 hai anak adam sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkan kepadamu pakaian untuk menutupi auratmu dan pakaian indah untuk perhiasan
9179228 nabi shallallahu alaihi wasallam melakukan itikaf pada sepuluh hari terakhir yang di dalamnya dicari lailatul qadar untuk menghentikan berbagai kesibukannya mengosongkan pikirannya dan untuk mengasingkan diri demi bermunajat kepada tuhannya berdzikir dan berdoa kepada nya

9179278 we are always pretty conservative in our estimates and we were predicting we would be down approximately 150 students from june to september
9179279 what that means is there are fewer five year old students in the central okanagan versus graduating grade 12s
9179280 its going to be real interesting by the end of the first week of september because weve got schools that are reporting significant numbers of new families to the area its not the family that moves from lakeview heights to the mission its families coming in from alberta ontario even overseas
9179281 she was late in delivering and she had to be induced they sent her home because nothing was happening

9179294 we are facing a profound economic downturn along with every other country in the world
9179295 the difference is between us and previous governments other parties is that we are taking action to help people whether it is rescuing northern rock or whether it is helping people to get back into work as they lose their jobs or tax rebates which are due at the end of next month
9179296 all my colleagues the prime minister every single one of us are focused on one single thing that is helping people helping the economy go through what is a very difficult time
9179297 i think it is important i tell people in this country that we along with every other country in the world face a unique set of circumstances where youve got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices
9179298 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9179299 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9179300 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9179301 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9179302 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression

9179305 the biggest thing ive learned is team work especially while working with various tuav platoons from different brigades

9179321 el avi n estuvo un total de 33 minutos en plataforma por lo que no se justificaba un cambio de avi n que habr a implicado un retraso superior a los 60 minutos para el desembarque de pasajeros equipaje y carga a rea y su posterior embarque en un nuevo aparato o incluso superior en el caso de que se perdieran los derechos de despegue
9179322 querr a que el tema robinho estuviera cerrado pero no es as por lo que no puede ir a la coru a
9179323 nos dimos cuenta despu s del partido de ida de la supercopa en valencia est preocupado y con demasiada presi n en la cabeza
9179324 s lo puedo ponerme en el papel del entrenador aconsejar e intentar convencer de que debe estar con nosotros porque creo que puede ser importante aqu en el equipo ahora estar diez d as fuera con la selecci n as que que se relaje y que vuelva ya listo para trabajar
9179325 soy como el padre que sabe lo que es mejor para el ni o pero ahora l no lo ve con el tiempo estoy seguro de que se dar cuenta
9179326 estoy deseando de que se hable definitivamente de f tbol
9179327 estoy deseando que llegue ya el d a 1 o 2 de septiembre y que se empiece hablar definitivamente de f tbol y nada m s se han intentado varias cosas pero no se ha podido completar con m s jugadores esta gran plantilla lo importante es la base que tenemos a trav s de ella no hay que preocuparse porque hemos demostrado en los ltimos partidos que tenemos una beuna base y ganas de seguir mejorando
9179328 no es f cil porque influyen muchos factores que son dif ciles de controlar
9179329 no s lo hay que tener en cuenta el jugador o el dinero sino tambi n el entorno del jugador que no suele ser f cil de convencer
9179330 la motivaci n es mucho mayor y no se cae en la relajaci n
9179331 tiene que estar al m ximo lo m s r pidamente posible
9179332 el campo es lo que es y el rival tambi n as que no se tienen que buscar excusas tenemos que ir a ganar

9179340 do you have any idea of what you did to make lyda green dislike you hate you
9179341 um you know once and a while i try to figure that out but i cant figure that out
9179342 the governor called senator green to explain that she does not condone name calling in any way and apologized if there was a perception that the comment was attributed to the governor
9179343 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself
9179344 you have a choice be a fighting liberal or sit quietly i know what i am what are you
9179345 cassie what are we going to do all those people ive donated all that i can
9179346 cassie you should not be thinking about how much money it would cost to help others in need
9179347 relatively open either through neglect on the part of the state or because they have somehow escaped notice by the mapmakers 39 their nomadic inhabitants can capitalize on their autonomy
9179348 el campo es lo que es y el rival tambi n as que no se tienen que buscar excusas tenemos que ir a ganar
9179349 complicado tendr que hacerse todo bien aunque no se ganar o perder la liga en funci n del resultado
9179350 muy contento con el equipo y con los fichajes que se han hecho
9179351 han hecho un muy buen trabajo y ahora se tiene que redondear con la victoria en soria estamos en tres competiciones y las lucharemos todas
9179352 una vez hayamos jugado sabremos si es un grupo f cil o dif cil
9179353 por un nombre se pueda saber la calidad de un equipo sobre el terreno de juego
9179354 every man did what was right in his own eyes
9179355 now these things happened as examples for us so that we would not crave evil things as they also craved

9179358 i think we will still hear zombie nation played at the games
9179359 it may not be for a two minute stretch of time but that was an important spirit generating piece of our game last year and i think youll see it again this year
9179360 our goal is get to the bottom of this case
9179361 this case is a economic crimes case what we want to accomplish is get to the bottom of caylee marie anthonys disappearance
9179362 again we have forensic evidence that has been returned to us regarding the vehicle
9179363 preliminary information indicates that there is decomposition in that vehicle from a human body we want to make sure that all of the information that we have we review carefully we review authorially and our investigators are excellent at doing this and will continue to do that throughout the coming days and weeks
9179364 its frustrating and its scary that the government would throw out all the rules ignore the constitution flex their power whenever they decide to and try to endanger the presumption of innocence
9179365 this was all about trying to show that she is a bad person and not about trying to find caylee you had the officers who are homicide detectives over here arresting her for an economics crime people are smarter than that people arent as stupid as law enforcement thinks they are with their leaks and their little shows we need to get them focused on finding caylee not on creating little spectacles like this
9179366 there are compelling reasons for her actions but im not going to be bullied into displaying into showing my hand because they decide to put on a little spectacle im going to do it in a courtroom in a dignified manner and not in front of the cameras like they did
9179367 hey babe i hope its okay but i invited a few friends over for this friday
9179368 i can tell you that i know sarah and shes a remarkable woman a great mother shes one of those people who will amaze everybody with her style
9179369 she has challenged the influence of big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
9179370 as commander in chief of the washington national guard i deploy them for in state or to sister states for needs of humanitarian efforts or to respond to a natural disaster
9179371 many americans are worried about the health of our housing and job markets i share these concerns about our economy yet there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9179372 try to score political points instead of getting work done for the american people
9179373 so that we can create more opportunities for american farmers ranchers and entrepreneurs
9179374 what helps her obviously is that shes a women shes attractive shes a conservative she has a strong record of integrity shes a spending cutter not a tax raiser and those things obviously would help
9179375 moved as you are by the play of menses on your dehiscent member

9179392 well be able to put the new generator to practical use in three years
9179393 the new generating units also could be used in an inland reservoir
9179394 they can be used to manufacture hydrogen co2 free fuel by electrolysis
9179395 its so hard you hear what he says and you want to believe it but how many times have we been disappointed before this
9179396 were here as veterans as soldiers as marines here to demand that the democratic party uphold to the front that they have as an antiwar party and actually make a stand and bring our soldiers home now

9179400 nunca hab a visto la soledad tan bien reflejada en una pel cula y busqu al director para conocerlo
9179401 una experiencia f sicamente dura pero que tuvo un componente m stico con la naturaleza
9179402 nuestros personajes toman caminos divergentes pero nosotros tuvimos una relaci n verdaderamente unida
9179403 para esta pel cula he intentado equilibrar fondo y forma para poder trascender con mi historia
9179404 we are currently interviewing applicants that have submitted their resumes to the board for the position of general manager
9179405 it has left the whole family in darkness this episode just because of some i dont know some foolish mistakes from some person
9179406 i have spoken to dr haneef and he is obviously concerned that his reputation has been impugned over the last 13 months by the afp continuing to refer to him as a suspect
9179407 and we have made no secret of the fact that he will be seeking compensation for the immense damage to his career his family and his reputation
9179408 when danger threatened he never got hurt he knew just what to do hed duck and cover duck and cover
9179409 first you have to know what happens when an atomic bomb explodes youll know when it comes we hope it never comes but we must get ready
9179410 in that particular community especially its still a topic of discussion quite regular sure is it was a big deal
9179411 they evacuated us that day they shot it and let us back in late that afternoon and when they shot the other one they evacuated us again
9179412 im originally from this area and grew up about a mile from ground zero
9179413 i think the big blast was really way bigger than everybody anticipated including the atomic energy commission it broke windows and shattered chimneys and did all kinds of stuff out in that community and the shot was felt for i guess 20 or 30 miles from ground zero it was a it was a big boom
9179414 oh it was a good project here then going on a lot of people working yeah near about everyone that wanted a job could get one then
9179415 i forgot now how many drilling rigs they had out there i know they had one that drilled that great big hole they had
9179416 determine how a country might conduct a clandestine nuclear test and whether or not the tools that were available at the time to the scientists and engineers were up to the task of detecting such a test and distinguishing between a nuclear event and an earthquake
9179417 damaged his house pretty good yes sir cracked his chimney he had a brick flue in the kitchen it tore it down in the floor and some more stuff cracked a lot of brick walls here and chimneys
9179418 uh you dont hear too much about it no more but it was the talk of the town back in them days
9179419 the old mill ive had it about 12 years here probably
9179420 well i grind a little corn meal for the public and i sell mill here grist corn flour and i try to grow me some corn to grind
9179421 id say a mile mile and a quarter through the woods
9179422 yeah we got worried about it but it checked out all right later mama had a problem with her well she had a well and it went bad and she had another one put down they found something in it and they came back and drilled her another one moved over further from that one
9179423 ive always been one to tackle the impossible im very aggressive about things
9179424 the people in the salmon salt dome area were concerned about their drinking water supplies and most of them had their own water wells
9179425 you have an element of people that will never be convinced that the ground water etc is not contaminated you have some thats always going to think its contaminated
9179426 we aint never had no water problem at all but people back around over there did that was pretty close to that thing a lot of them had problems with the water
9179427 theres been rumors that they have some frogs with 20 or 30 toes on each foot and theres been some cats house cats that came up with six or eight toes on their feet too but im not sure that had anything to do with that
9179428 weve had a lot of cancer in this area out here
9179429 there was never any final results showing any contamination of the radioactive substance known as tritium there were some minute traces out in the immediate area where they did the big bomb but not in peoples water but that still didnt alleviate the fears that perhaps someday it might seep into the water system so that was our concern
9179430 no one can buy alitalia in the state its in
9179431 with all respect i am not merlin the magician the business is toast it doesnt exist any more theres nothing left
9179432 shall i pack your jesus in plastic or do you want to carry him as is
9179433 the strangers is 10 times scarier because these killers have no motive feel no remourse and could very well be your neighbors friends or even relatives just the feeling that some random people will come and kill you
9179434 why did you summon me in the middle of the night ms sharpe
9179435 but i notice that this time when i have you up against a wall theres no threat to kick my balls from here to kingdom come
9179436 is for you to show me the precise spot where wandas body was found so i can figure out if it was even marginally possible to fire a gun from this angle and kill her
9179437 a twenty five caliber raven arms could easily hit her from here
9179438 and it would look like the point black shot that killed her especially to a jury predisposed to a guilty verdict
9179439 but that wasnt in the official report submitted into evidence no point blank range by anyones definition remember lucy evidence was tampered with by the real killer
9179440 if thats really where she died then someone inside this graveyard couldnt have fired the gun but you cant see the whole alley someone else could have been out there
9179441 someone named higgins or did you forget what brought you to charleston in the first place
9179442 im just looking at the evidence jack i havent convicted our target yet
9179443 in 1987 a local amateur photographer took a photo of that headstone right there
9179444 in that photograph the translucent image of a mother and her child on the anniversary of that childs death appeared before that headstone
9179445 but the most famous moment in philadelphia alley history was on a hot august night in 1771 when two local businessmen dueled to the death on this very spot
9179446 what makes picking a woman any different than say selecting a catholic blue collar rooted pennsylvanian as your running mate who shores up lunch bucket democrats youre too liberal and black to reach
9179447 ich bin bereits von der dfl informiert worden die sind genauso wie wir von dem bericht auf spiegel online berrascht worden

9179452 wir wissen dass wir mit 5 1 prozent der stimmen nicht die gesamte politik bestimmen k nnen
9179453 its pretty amazing this thing holds 90 000 people i have a feeling there will be a lot of chomping motions by gator fans and not too many people cheering for the warriors its very impressive and theres nobody here right now imagine what its going to be like when its full
9179454 we went with the guy whos going to give us the best chance to win and alexander has been getting the most reps in the last two weeks that was important
9179455 at that point brent was better but greg was hurting then his feet were bothering him now hes fine and brent has been playing good hell be the next guy in the game
9179456 we play for hawaii and the people of hawaii thats who i feel responsible for i have to have these guys ready to play this is a big challenge there are a lot of brick walls to get through but i believe in my players and i believe in my coaches
9179457 ive said over and over that were playing for the state of hawaii i told the players they have two names on their jerseys the name on the back is theirs and their familys and the name on the front is hawaii and we play for both it is important for us to play our hearts out every game because of who we represent thats why we have to give our best effort each week all the time
9179458 i wont rule it out completely but were only going to do home and home series and were not going to do them often it has to make sense for us that means it would be a program that would be good for us to play and that would help us draw people when they came to hawaii
9179459 i think theres enough teams on the west coast and the colorados scheduled to play four games against uh starting in 2010 and those people that i probably wouldnt come out here and spend all that money
9179460 from a financial perspective donovan said uh will net between 300 000 and 350 000 by playing the gators
9179461 its a really nice stadium but ive been in big stadiums and so have these kids itll be a college game day experience and thats going to be exciting for everybody but i dont even know how big a crowd is when youre coaching because youre focused in on whats going on
9179462 i think its awesome that they made the trip here to show their support and itll mean a lot to the players and coaches
9179463 googles a great company got some great products but you know in some respects i think google is where microsoft was 7 or 10 years ago
9179464 microsoft has over 40 full time people invested in privacy and over 400 part time people google least from what i read about them evolved to that
9179465 we think about privacy as part of the core design we have thought about how to design privacy into the product as opposed to how to react to the negative impressions
9179466 so these are all images that anyone could go out and take with a camera we do take great care that if someone did feel their privacy was invaded there is a way that they can easily tell us about it and well remove it right away
9179467 the thing is any time you get a provider in the market that has a predominantly large share of that market questions start to get asked about their practices about what their motives are
9179468 i desperately hope that they in fact i expect that they will change they will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around so in some respects its a predictable thing
9179469 dangerous category 3 hurricane gustav path tropical storm gustav path
9179470 its certainly a bold pick and its one that i do think is going to make women disappointed by hillary clintons failure to break the glass ceiling take a strong look at our team
9179471 john mccain is not scared to take a chance he genuinely thinks outside the box and once people get to know sarah palin and hear her life story theyre going to see what john mccain saw
9179472 this is a desperate and cynical attempt to lure women voters and capitalize on the success of hillary clinton you cant just pick any woman for the job they are not interchangeable
9179473 my agenda was to stop wasteful spending and cut property taxes and put the people first
9179474 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination
9179475 without hillary being the nominee its really quite equally as important because people are looking for a smart campaign and i think this might do it
9179476 im hoping that if their first priority is electing a woman female voters will realize that sarah palin is a person of excellent character
9179477 where do we go where do we go now where do we go

9179485 thats my no 1 love and im definitely not going to let this stop me playing the sax thats for sure

9179511 das sind die ewigen versprechen und alten irrt mer der sp pr sentiert durch ein etwas freundlicheres gesicht vielleicht
9179512 was sich da abspielt ist eine geldverbrauchsspirale nach oben und eine zukunftsverbrauchsspirale nach unten
9179513 falsch dass in so aufgeheizter atmosph re die zukunft vieler sterreicher verschleudert wird

9179520 weve got ten more days as mister and missus and were going to spend them together
9179521 the difference in the extraordinary versus ordinary mass is that ordinary means that it is done in the vernacular in our case that is english
9179522 the mass pope benedict authorized done in latin is the same mass that was done in 1962 the last time latin masses were said back then our priests were versed in latin but since the 1960s latin is no longer required in seminaries the important thing is that the mass can not just be recited verbatim it has to be understood
9179523 were getting pretty good feedback and attendance has been steadily increasing
9179524 i think its comforting for some of the older people who remember praying the mass in latin and longed for it for quite a while part of it the congregation is people who are seeing what its like the young people are interested in learning a different form of reverence for the lord and the ceremony of that liturgy
9179525 fr libby came and wanted to start a latin mass and it fit in with us
9179526 a lot are drawn by the meaning of the words
9179527 some like to listen to the chants theyre something new they havent heard
9179528 when i leave i feel good it gives me comfort i can remember certain things that i can recall from years ago
9179529 when i told people i wanted to be a priest they were shocked and disbelieving some of them thought i should be committed
9179530 now if a youth says he wants to be a priest there is huge discouragement it is seen as a very silly career move
9179531 i was ordained 22 years ago and when i was in the seminary there were a hundred of us just for the dublin diocese
9179532 a woman in the sacristy at a wedding on saturday looked at me and said are you the parish priest
9179533 and its not going to get any easier morale can be low at times you are just working so hard and theres nobody coming behind you
9179534 we have had no candidates for the priesthood for 12 years maybe 15 no intake in that length of time
9179535 way back we had so many priests they were sent on loan to glasgow or england or america
9179536 its the secularisation of ireland the reduction in family size ireland has just caught up with the more secular europe with its more libertarian values good values around freedom and individuality and personal choice
9179537 it really bolsters you buoys you up to see that
9179538 but theres absolutely no need to be they can see it as a sort of competition theyre afraid that if they give people more power theyre going to lose power
9179539 but it isnt like that its a collaborative effort a sharing of responsibility it takes a lot of weight off the priest
9179540 for us to be able to survive we must share the workload said fr mullan
9179541 its quite threatening to the professional identity of the priest when non ordained people come into work in the parish theyre to be paid more than the clergy and perhaps in time their status will be equal to or greater than the clergy
9179542 its up to us to reorganise things and adapt to the change
9179543 we have to recognise whatever god is saying to us about combining the roles of the clergy and the laity
9179544 lefty serves are tricky to read and with really good net coverage as well youve got to return great and pass well if you want to win
9179545 i managed to do that in the third and fourth sets against llodra but the first couple of sets i didnt and it was very tough
9179546 hes another lefty comes to the net a lot plays aggressive
9179547 its up to the youngsters in the next two games to stick their hands up and stake a claim
9179548 ive got a dressing room that is a little bit down in confidence but well sit down and hammer home the basics again
9179549 its up to us to bring those young guys forward as quickly as we possibly can and the starting point for me is lords
9179550 planning for housing needs transportation needs and climate change needs all at the same time

9179571 there really is nothing for us to do in maidstone and i felt this would be an ideal way to start a new movement
9179572 it could be very popular but this will be the first time something like this has been tried so i am very nervous about it
9179573 i hope plenty of people come along but as with every new event it will take time for word to spread
9179574 we really do need something to do in the area
9179575 we are not always welcome at other places and it can sometimes turn nasty if someone mentions they are gay
9179576 i would also welcome anyone who is over 18 but this really is primarily aimed at those aged 16 to 18 looking for somewhere to get together and chat
9179577 i have been telling everyone there is no drinking allowed
9179578 im looking forward to it it has been billed at the first event of its kind in the uk and i certainly havent heard of any others
9179579 gay teenagers in this area dont have much to do as a group so an event like this could easily turn into a regular thing if it goes well
9179580 the nightclubs in maidstone have under 18s nights for straight people so we thought it would be great to have an under 18s night for the gay community
9179581 if the evening turns out to be a success and theres no real reason why it wont then well do it again
9179582 our licence already says we can have 16 year olds plus so we didnt need to ask for permission for this event which makes it easier
9179583 it would be good for the youngsters to have a meeting place that is easy to publicise with the internet
9179584 there was nothing like that when i was their age which does make life hard it is much easier to make contact now and evenings like this are just an extension of that
9179585 we would back events like this but not if they are being held in a pub
9179586 we have too many concerns about underage drinking it would need to be properly organised and monitored a better location would have been somewhere like a youth club
9179587 there will be no alcohol served to those under age at this event i have made that very clear and the organisers are happy with that decision
9179588 why does a computer boot up and then freeze up and then steady beep
9179589 alternatively if this is not possible i would request that you send the survey link to your members the survey will be designed to be completely anonymous and confidential without the ability of me or my research team to verify the identity of those who complete the survey

9179595 otherwise we must leave egypt without having seen our families in gaza
9179596 we are now merely running on hope and faith that the border will open one day
9179597 i put my name on the list right away but it didnt achieve anything weve been told repeatedly that the border will open soon but weeks have passed and here we are still wasting our money no one is looking out for us not our own representatives not the egyptian authorities
9179598 my family is the sacrifice of a political problem we arent fatah hamas or any faction my mother needs help for her condition but cant get it and i need to be with her but cant get in
9179599 i went to the rafah crossing and was told by egyptian authorities to go back that the crossing was closed i returned to al arish and gave a copy of my passport to the representative from the palestinian embassy and was told i must wait but i have no idea how long they will make me wait nor how long i can wait i have a wife and my studies back in europe
9179600 i dont think the border will open i think ill spend another year here without seeing my family its very difficult staying here waiting hoping to see your family but realizing that you cant
9179601 this isnt just my story i have maybe five other friends also studying at the faculty of medicine who want to go back to gaza
9179602 i need to be near my family my birthplace my children need to see their grandparents
9179603 when will the border be opened why are we being punished
9179604 fifty days ive been waiting here for fifty days now i was due to start work two weeks ago and i keep telling myself ill leave egypt tomorrow but then i hear that maybe the border will open i cant give up this option i cant give up my hope
9179605 by enforcing the truce only in gaza israel is trying to enforce the idea of separating gaza from the west bank as two separate states

9179719 the best source of information i found on medical biomagnetism was the website cancuns first wellness center
9179720 in the 20th century the effect and impact of magnetic field therapy on over 200 000 people in more than 3 000 scientific studies have been officially published
9179721 this particular application of magnetic field therapy is based on dr thesis who was a physiotherapist for astronauts and who in 1988 gave a seminar on biomagnetics where the organic ph energetic phenomena was exposed
9179722 it medicinal biomagnetism defines the charges classifies them organizes neutralizes and heals symptoms decline
9179723 the method works forcing the charges toward the inside of the organism so the charges neutralize themselves on their own
9179724 in general common diseases are produced by a single bio magnetic pair bmp complex diseases are the result of association of two or more bmps
9179725 the research has shown that the bmps may be divided in 4 categories 1 regular bmps identify pathogenic microorganisms whether they are virus bacteria fungi or parasites 2 special bmps identify tissue alteration not supported by pathogenic microorganisms 3 dysfunctional bmps are the ones that affect glands and hormonal production 4 reservoir bmps identify organs or tissue which support potentially pathogenic virus and can keep them in reserve for an indefinite time until some alteration in the body triggers it sending it to its specific location
