7030025 i got very scared and i wondered what causes this and how can this be stopped so i started looking in to it and i found out that mangroves are the best way to stop this from happening again
7030026 imagine what mangroves do for us when they are not cut they prevent soil erosion they are a barrier between the land and the sea and they prevent surge storms
7030027 we geloven nog steeds niet dat je de zanger bent
7030028 i think its irresponsible of the scientific community to just turn their nose up at this because of its past association as a tabloid subject
7030029 and i dont mean somebody with crude carved wooden feet strapped to their boots tromping around in the mud
7030030 there just arent that many people out there with the understanding of the subtleties of anatomy and kinematics of the human foot
7030031 its not a matter of well if we if the government just turned the satellite to look for it wed be able to pick it out
7030032 i need to play well this week and next and so far ive done that
7030033 if nick then feels i am worthy of a pick so be it if not then thats acceptable
7030034 i was just very relaxed out there with the boys sons tyrone and conor here ive got to be on my best behaviour and my attitude is just pretty good
7030035 ive taken a lot of pressure off myself and feel comfortable ive been playing well and im in a good position now
7030036 i tried really hard and i knew i was going to be ready for the bronze medal fight
7030037 leeds were pretty hot tonight we couldnt handle them which was disappointing
7030038 at 12 10 we had got back in the game but we gifted them a try and then let in a couple of soft ones
7030039 but were not down and out it was a great lesson for us on how intense we have to be at this time of the year
7030040 we are starting to claw our way back and do some positive things
7030041 its great to see all the lads smiling and feel the joy around them
7030042 i have had no word about arsenal wanting gareth barry and that is all i want to say on the subject other than that we are working towards improving our squad

7030049 none no excitement no war he likes excitement whatever it be and the list is not attractive but then he condescends to talk of small matters like maria and julia
7030050 even edmund is at times at marias where you may know my sister is living at present marys appetite for society remains undimmed
7030051 perhaps living there she is no longer alive to its beauty but to me on a day like this it is an uncommon sight
7030052 oh i think so too i can imagine no where lovelier than mansfield park
7030053 yes but not once alone she was in a pack all the time she danced a great deal she spoke a great deal but said nothing sensible or even kind she was i suppose her london self like a stranger with whom i had to argue every little point
7030054 society will forgive us what do i care about society id have lost you a thousand times rather than see you for what you really are
7030055 hi this is john i have been assigned to be your mentor but i dont know what that means
7030056 shrug off the nancy boy image and get back to being real men
7030057 i think girls are over guys who are worried about waxing and exfoliating
7030058 all my mates are from the country and really down to earth
7030059 we like drinking beer we swear a lot and we hate shaving
7030060 on the one hand men seem to be saying its ok to be a real man and on the other hand theyre doing this as a good technique to get womens attention
7030061 what i find interesting is that men now have this choice of how they present themselves
7030062 there are plenty of men out there who have access to both their power tools and their feelings
7030063 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7030064 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7030065 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7030066 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7030067 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7030068 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7030069 uganda has a thriving economy and is actively seeking investment funds and exploring trade opportunities with georgia and other southeastern states
7030070 i think both of them have been pretty busy this week responding to each others criticisms
7030071 we need to be taking care of more of the citys business
7030072 and just because an area has typically voted republican before does not mean that thats what theyll do this time we believe that georgians are ready for change
7030073 i hear hes looking for a ride to the republican national convention but doesnt have one yet
7030074 the only person to speak out in opposition of the born alive infant protection act
7030075 erick you know its outrageous that what youre really saying here is that barack obama wants to kill babies he wants to kill them after theyre born he wants to chase them after theyre out of the womb and make sure they dont live
7030076 you believe that barack obama supports infanticide he wants to kill babies
7030077 he wants you to be able to finish off a kid if it survives an abortion
7030078 context sensitive approach that does not harm the economy and quality of life of macon
7030079 and then theres the thing the other day when mccain was asked what
7030080 an internet troll or simply troll in internet slang is someone who posts controversial and irrelevant or off topic messages in an online community such as an online discussion forum or chat room with the intention of provoking other users into an emotional response or to generally disrupt normal on topic discussion
7030081 could you please explain in under 15 words or less why racism is bad
7030082 if i was a hard core democrat id be pretty pissed that obama was our choice
7030083 we think its still far too early in this race to identify any city as the front runner with four world class cities in the race all with compelling campaigns
7030084 you need to be seen as everybodys second best friend
7030085 can we count on your vote that doesnt happen anymore
7030086 when god made the world he prepared rio for the olympic games
7030087 we dont want a favor we dont want a gift we deserve this for all weve done in the past
7030088 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7030089 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7030090 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7030091 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
7030092 wants people to shift their responses beyond the man standing in front of the tank
7030093 i am impressed by the cosmopolitan atmosphere i didnt think it would be so urban and so advanced
7030094 the one thing the olympics has shown americans is that china has a very well developed and successful infrastructure and its easy to get around
7030095 its almost like theyve thrown the communist manifesto out of the window
7030096 i cant think of any other reason or any other party with an interest
7030097 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it
7030098 we are not experienced sailors as a results there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board
7030099 i brought the kids so if they the activists arrive i can tell them welcome and thank you for not forgetting us

7030102 what started as a tool for students socializing has become a completely new mode of communication for everyone no matter your age facebook is now for so many people their homepage key portal to the internet and online communities its scope and uses and new applications grow daily its also a way for websites and blogs to promote their content in a non intrusive manner to readers and relative audiences as a former pr professional im entranced by this customized and relevant approach to outreach i cannot stand spam and frankly i havent achieved a revenue stream that provides an advertising budget facebook bypasses those traditional online channels and in a mellow yet viral fashion promotes a message whether global or intensely personal awesome
7030103 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
7030104 general david petraeus has endorsed a book written by an evangelical lutheran chaplain in the us army in which the chaplain claims non believers can lead to failure in their military unit
7030105 should be in every rucksack for those times when soldiers need spiritual energy
7030106 a slap in the face from the commander of u s forces in iraq to the 21 of the men and women fighting there who define themselves as atheists or having no religious preference a reprehensible betrayal of all of the non theists who are putting their lives on the line for our country with every bit as much bravery and dedication as their religious comrades
7030107 general petraeus has by his own hand become a quintessential poster child of this fundamentalist christian religious predation via his unadulterated and shocking public endorsement of a book touting both christian supremacy and exceptionalism
7030108 general petraeus who never has been troubled by army regulations nor constitutional ones claims that when mccoy asked him for a recommendation he didnt give him to publish it that it was only intended for mccoy personally
7030109 petraeuss endorsement has been on that book jacket since the book was published last year
7030110 we have it in our power to begin the world over again
7030111 what happened mrs applewhite that nasty aclu wouldnt let you run a prayer service during science class are you okay
7030112 oh its just a marginal thing they arent really this focused at changing things
7030113 saving water from field to fork curbing losses and wastage in the food chain
7030114 decentralized wastewater treatment systems dewats and sanitation in development countries
7030115 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
7030116 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
7030117 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
7030118 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
7030119 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
7030120 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
7030121 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
7030122 new book out and making the move to open access
7030123 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
7030124 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
7030125 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
7030126 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
7030127 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7030128 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7030129 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
7030130 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
7030131 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
7030132 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun

7030370 establish and utilize a secure communications and information technology infrastructure including data mining and other advanced analytical tools in order to access receive and analyze data
7030371 whats important here is that we not reflexively say that data mining is bad but we need to have in place the rules of the road here about when data can be collected how it can be used
7030372 we have not really had that discussion about what the rules of the road are
7030373 it is important to note that no consensus exists on what constitutes data mining
7030374 this is the lexis nexis search string that i use for ag appointments
7030375 given that the data reside in no buffer for more than 1 2 seconds before being automatically overwritten we believe that the copyrighted works here are not embodied in the buffers for a period of more than transitory duration and therefore are not fixed in the buffers

7030377 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
7030378 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use
7030379 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it except copy it

7030381 there is a hitch in the case against mygazines however mygazines is registered in the caribbean island of anguilla and hosted in sweden by the notorious prq the stockholm based prq is owned by the founders of bittorrent tracker site pirate bay and is known for hosting other dubious sites with its domain name registered abroad and its servers beyond u s borders as well mygazines seems to have slipped around the jurisdiction of u s copyright law even though publishers could pursue legal action against the site for material available in the u s thered be no way to get representatives for the company to court or to collect damages

7030388 this is an engaging and fascinating video presentation by professor james duane of the regent university school of law explaining why in a criminal matter you should never ever ever talk to the police or any other government agent it doesnt matter if youre guilty or innocent if you have an alibi or not it isnt possible for anything you say to help you and its very possible that innocuous things you say will hurt you definitely worth half an hour of your time http video google com videoplay docid 4097602514885833865 and this is a video of virginia beach police department officer george bruch who basically says that duane is right http video google com videoplay docid 6014022229458915912 amp q amp hl en

7030428 we propose that virtual environments can be used to study neuronal processes involved in semi naturalistic behavior as determined by content analysis importantly the activation pattern reflects brain environment interactions rather than stimulus responses as observed in classical experimental designs
7030429 compared with nonplayers action video game players could tolerate smaller target distractor distances thus the spatial resolution of visual processing is enhanced in this population critically similar effects were observed in non video game players who were trained on an action video game this result verifies a causative relationship between video game play and augmented spatial resolution

7030447 no hay pr cticamente salvo en dos o tres momentos del trayecto que proponer alternativa porque no hay ninguna afecci n

7030464 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios

7030466 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7030471 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7030472 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7030473 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7030474 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7030475 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7030476 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

7030489 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7030490 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7030491 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7030499 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7030500 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7030501 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7030502 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7030503 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7030504 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7030505 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7030506 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7030507 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7030508 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7030509 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7030510 in him was acted out the great struggle between individuality and system the player in him wanted to dribble to invent tricks and to embarrass his opponents and yet as he later admitted his training at the polytechnic institute drove him to a systematic approach to break down football into its component tasks
7030511 we realised at liverpool that you cant score a goal every time you get the ball and we learned from europe from the latin people when they play the ball from the back they play in little groups
7030512 six players in midfield all of whom could rotate attack and defend but youd need to have six decos in midfield he doesnt just attack he runs tackles covers all over the pitch you find him playing at right back sometimes
7030513 i pushed up and we caught four or five players offside i was pleased because it was still new to me and i was finding it difficult but michels came and shouted at me what he wanted was for us then to charge the guy with the ball with the players we had spare because they had men out of the game in offside positions thats how offside becomes an offensive game
7030514 look theres now ten of you and five of them dont stop just run at them take the ball off them and score
7030515 because its a good way to get the ball back and it means neeskens only has to run 40 metres not 80 metres
7030516 premiership football is far more skilful now than it was even ten years ago but it remains quicker and less possession driven than any other major league
7030517 globalisation is blurring national styles but tradition perpetuated by coaches players pundits and fans is strong enough that they remain distinguishable what became apparent in the writing of this book is that every nation came fairly quickly to recognise its strengths and that no nation seems quite to trust them brazilian football is all about flair and improvisation but it looks yearningly at the defensive organisation of the italians
7030518 the president has made it clear several times until now america was russias advocate when it came to integrating the country into the global community
7030519 we included russia in the group of eight g8 leading industrialized nations
7030520 we welcomed and pushed forward russias desire to join the world trade organization that is all at risk now
7030521 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7030522 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7030523 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7030524 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7030525 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7030526 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7030527 this lays it on really thick if only the disingenuous christians were always so obviously heretical ignorant
7030528 jesus was just too touchy feely now paul on the other hand
7030529 that whole shepherd leaving the 99 to go after the one stray sheep i dont buy it
7030530 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7030531 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7030532 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7030533 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7030537 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7030538 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7030539 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7030540 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7030541 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7030542 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7030543 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7030544 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7030545 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7030546 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7030547 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7030548 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7030549 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7030550 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7030551 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7030552 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7030553 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7030554 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7030555 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7030556 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7030557 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7030558 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7030559 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7030560 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7030561 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7030562 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7030563 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

7030565 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7030566 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7030567 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

7030578 if i choose to follow proven procedures effective for a large number of people over lengthy periods of time and i do these procedures every day or several times every day is that more likely to help me than the 1 2 or 3 hours week that most other treatment modalities require of their patients
7030579 je pense que nous avons touch le fond mais comme tout ceci est li la situation politique il est difficile de pr voir ce qui va se passer

7030587 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7030588 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7030589 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7030590 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7030591 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7030592 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7030593 yet it was good of you to share in my troubles
7030594 i think he may have learned at that time that power is everything and weakness is nothing
7030595 there were plenty of warnings for anyone who was listening that there was going to be confrontation in the streets of chicago
7030596 the only question was how was it going to be handled and what would the ultimate outcome of it be
7030597 he had a great pride in chicago he had a great love for the city throw into that a good measure of his irish temper and you had a volatile mix
7030598 ribicoff stared down at daley looked him in the eye
7030599 the confrontation was created by the people who charged the police gentlemen get the thing straight once and for all the policeman isnt there to create disorder the policeman is there to preserve disorder
7030600 the democratic convention of 1968 was a disaster for the city of chicago it was a disaster for richard j daley and it was a disaster for the democratic party
7030601 the 68 convention left such a bad taste in the mouths of democrats all across the country that even party regulars were blaming richard j daley for the fate of the party losing the election in 68
7030602 chicagoans thought the way he handled those demonstrations was the way it ought to be handled
7030603 as a result of the convention in 1968 richard j daley could never be defeated in the city of chicago
7030604 the people of chicago admired him for being a strong leader
7030605 he saw chaos and he saw his dad lose control
7030606 i think he may have learned at that time that power is everything and weakness is nothing
7030607 he came to the conclusion very early on that he had to change with the times or that he was doomed to failure
7030608 and he made a very conscious effort to avoid the mistakes that older political bosses in chicago had made
7030609 that coalition has never wavered in their support for richard m daley not once
7030610 and hes added to that the growing support in the black community and the other new communities like the asian community you win elections by addition and he has been very good at that
7030611 theres a lot to be said for the progress of the city its important for tax revenues its important to make the city livable
7030612 how would i sum up their leadership call them great mayors but remember the price the price is corruption
7030613 je ne vois pas dautre raison ni dautre partie y ayant un int r t

7030616 real madrid would never retain a player on the team against his wishes and would have no choice but to call for a unilateral resolution of the contract if the player willed it so
7030617 given the high personal and professional esteem that the club has always held the player in as he deserves
7030618 all i could think was thank god it went over the line
7030619 the record highlights the extent of the opportunity that we as a team have in front of us to achieve something significant and thats exciting
7030620 its one of the most striking and original solutions ive ever seen for building a genuine section within a section a daunting challenge for any magazine
7030621 i am very excited that senator obama has selected senator biden to be his running mate
7030622 the obama biden ticket provides the united states with a new and meaningful dialogue with world leaders and will improve americas standing with our allies and the global community
7030623 as a governor i know the value of having reliable partners who are willing to tackle tough challenges in washington

7030626 sales of mobile pcs have continued to grow creating an expanding notebook userbase of hardcore gamers casual gamers and general computer users this means the pc platform has effectively become a multi format market in itself the feedback from focus groups has been excellent and working closely with intel we are in the enviable position of having a beautiful exciting game that is accessible to everyone in terms of gameplay style computer hardware and static or mobile location
7030627 if it isnt jesus christ or elvis its going to be a letdown
7030628 nice now obama has thousands millions of new phone numbers to use this fall perhaps they never intended to release the news this way after all

7030638 i was taken by the self portrait that branwell did and i used that for inspiration to carve a larger version onto the panel
7030639 i just like the marks branwell makes on the paper he was an artist himself obviously
7030640 its a fantastic thing for visitors to see its quite a dramatic sight to see an artist working with a chainsaw
7030641 it was a tree that was believed to have been planted by charlotte bronte on her wedding day in 1854 and unfortunately it had to be felled this january because it had become diseased we thought it would be a lovely way to commemorate the tree and create a fun event for visitors
7030642 a sapling was taken from the original tree so something will hopefully grow back in the same spot as the original
7030643 the popular story is that he was an alcoholic drug addict who wasted his talents and held his sisters back
7030644 as a young man branwell showed great promise as an artist and writer his family were very proud of his talents his poetry was admired by experts and was published five years before any of his sisters work he also played an active part in haworth life
7030645 branwell did abuse drugs and alcohol in the last years of his life after a failed love affair but mrs gaskell exaggerated branwells downfall in her biography of charlotte and later writers have followed her lead
7030646 probably the strongest experience i have in foreign relations is the fact that i spent four years living overseas when i was a child in southeast asia
7030647 yesterday kids all over america spent the day looking for easter eggs and today their parents are in new york at bear stearns trying to find their nest eggs today at the white house president bush hosted the annual white house easter egg roll young kids roll easter eggs with spoons across the white house lawn what fun that must be for kids if this was 1908 in more serious news big controversy last week after state department officials looked at passport files of all three major candidates turns out they got a hold of john mccains social security number got his social security number you know what it is three well heres the big brouhaha former new mexico governor bill richardson still thinks hes loyal to the clinton family despite endorsing barack obama loyal he just endorsed barack even bill was more faithful to hillary than that actually the reason this is such a big story is that bill richardson was a member of the clinton cabinet and clinton adviser james carville on good friday he called bill richardson a judas called him a judas well you know there are a lot of biblical references in this race now theyre calling bill clinton jonah because he was once swallowed by a whale and larry craig did not file for re election by the deadline he legally cannot run for office again how about that ironically you know why larry craig missed the filing deadline he was in the mens room a democratic congressman from michigan john dingell wants to put an additional 50 cent tax on every gallon of gasoline gee im starting to understand why the democrats keep blowing these elections see the revenue raised by this goes towards repairing all the damage caused by taxpayers rioting over the fact that gas went up another 50 cents and former new york governor eliot spitzer now in rehab for sex addiction theyre trying to figure out why he wants to have sex with young women with no strings attached i dont know maybe cause hes a guy its just getting worse for him in the new york post today a former madam said that eliot spitzer would pay to watch other couples have sex he would pay to watch other couples have sex well thats something we dont have to worry about the new governor doing we will finally be safe there the president of france said today his country will reduce its arsenal of nuclear weapons because if theres one thing the french hate its being too prepared to defend themselves
7030648 you folks have a nice easter yesterday in new york city was the annual central park easter egg hunt amazing 1 500 eggs they found 1 500 eggs and three dead guys yesterday in new york everybody was in the easter spirit as a matter of fact former governor eliot spitzer he was in the easter spirit he spent the day with someone named bunny did you hear about this two state department employees were fired this is a bit of a scandal because they were looking at barack obamas passport file not only that but the same person was also looking at john mccains civil war records listen to this ladies and gentlemen youre not going to believe this there is a new super toilet on the market being described as high tech low flush senator larry craig just drove one off the lot he said by god ill take that little number senator larry craig from idaho he did not sign up for re election he is not going to run for office again so dont let the stall door hit you on the way out larry after the scandal you get the sordid details this is what i hate were now getting the sordid details with eliot spitzer former governor apparently when he was out whoring during sex he would always wear his black socks i know what you are thinking thanks dave for searing that image in our brains for me the only thing i keep on is my hair piece black socks well for heavens sakes who does this guy think he is rosie odonnell
7030649 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
7030650 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits
7030651 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
7030652 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
7030653 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
7030654 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
7030655 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
7030656 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
7030657 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
7030658 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
7030659 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
7030660 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
7030661 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
7030662 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
7030663 for on the day you eat of it you shall surely die
7030664 for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not
7030665 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7030666 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7030667 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7030668 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7030669 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7030670 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because our predecessors were thick does anybody really think that they didnt get what we had because they didnt have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment of course not it was because there was no platform upon which they could stand
7030671 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
7030672 we will have to see what other issues were present
7030673 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7030674 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7030675 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7030676 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7030677 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7030678 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7030679 haha of course it is cant you see the resemblance this is by far better than what anyone couldve written about you
7030680 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7030681 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7030682 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7030683 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7030684 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7030685 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7030686 youre not your cheery enthusiastic self on calls nowadays that charm you had on calls is not there anymore for the last few weeks listening to your calls used to be so enjoyable is work bogging you down
7030687 well sorta the call flows really high nowadays and the complaints are never ending
7030688 take it easy suheil baba the call flow will come and go you just stick to the basics and give it your best shot on every call if you are going to start sounding like most others on calls then that leaves us at quality nothing to look forward to at work
7030689 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7030690 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7030691 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7030692 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7030693 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7030694 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7030695 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7030696 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7030697 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7030698 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7030699 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7030700 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7030701 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7030702 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7030703 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7030704 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7030705 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7030706 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7030707 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7030708 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7030709 this one likes this and that one likes that blah blah blah
7030710 how many crps have you made for the month macha
7030711 good now make atleast one today and one tomorrow and ensure that they are clean sales
7030712 you made a missell on the first one you did
7030713 uhuh the customer interrupted you and after the objection you forgot to read a line in the legal scripting
7030714 yeah i remember that call but im sure i went back and read everything
7030715 well apparently not so you need to make another one today so that they can monitor that in place of the first one i told them to put it on hold until you make another one or else its a zero call
7030716 damn im sure it wasnt a missell but ill make another one anyways
7030717 good afternoon youre through to suheil how may i help you
7030718 uh hi i have a couple of queries on my account actually i forgot my pin no is it possible for you to send me another one
7030719 ive sent you a reminder pin and you should receive it in about 4 5 working days anything else i could help you with
7030720 uh yes actually i was just looking through my statements and i noticed that i didnt have this repayment protection
7030721 i didnt have this repayment protection i didnt have this repayment protection
7030722 heres another crp for you as clean as it can get
7030723 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7030724 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7030725 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7030726 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7030727 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7030728 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7030729 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7030730 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7030731 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7030732 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7030733 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7030734 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7030735 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7030736 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7030737 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7030738 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7030739 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7030740 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7030741 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7030742 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7030743 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7030744 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7030745 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7030746 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7030747 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7030748 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7030749 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7030750 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7030751 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7030752 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7030753 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7030754 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7030755 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7030756 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7030757 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7030758 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7030759 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7030760 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7030761 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7030767 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7030768 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7030769 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7030770 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7030771 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7030772 first the slovak orchestra is much better than the beijing orchestra pictured above which suffers from shrill upper string sound
7030773 more to the point the beijing orchestra is using breiners ideas so blatantly that it would be accused of plagiarism if its arrangers submitted their orchestration as original work in any respectable conservatory it isnt just the rockets red glare breiners basic conception of the whole piece has been copied
7030774 we have not heard of naxos rights international breiners publisher which has apparently attempted to discuss the issue with the committee
7030775 all the anthems and songs used at the beijing games were orchestrated by chinese musicians
7030776 my arrangements of public domain anthems are actually original compositions from a legal point of view

7030894 very nasty custody battle and the students are very often stuck in the middle
7030895 its the nature of shared governance and how does that work in a university
7030896 some faculty would like to see a more democratic way of running a university but we are actually constrained
7030897 to the extent that there are differences we are going to be able to talk about them
7030898 left unresolved the despondency characteristic of some members of constituent groups may inhibit continued institutional growth as the institution seeks to perform well with limited resources
7030899 i fully recognize the heroic efforts of our faculty staff and administration in meeting the mission and achieving the vision of this university under very difficult conditions
7030900 the csu is the solution to so many ills in the state of california
7030901 csu is a linchpin of opportunity for the people of this state
7030902 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
7030903 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
7030904 i am glad that the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7030905 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite u s presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7030906 thank you lord for whatever child you have blessed us with thank you that you trust me enough to care for any of your children whether normal or not and please give me the strength and wisdom to endure any hardships

7030910 my position is that i am personally opposed to abortion but i dont think i have a right to impose my few on the rest of society ive thought a lot about it and my position probably doesnt please anyone i think the government should stay out completely i will not vote to overturn the courts decision i will not vote to curtail a womans right to choose abortion but i will also not vote to use federal funds to fund abortion
7030911 if i denied you your dream i would not be marrying the man i fell in love with
7030912 if i lead this fight it will not be a single issue campaign
7030913 chosen to politicize the hearings in this kind of partisan fashion
7030914 it was an academic mistake i wasnt trying to hide it if i was trying to hide it why would i cite this article that no one else in the class found i didnt cheat
7030915 i was wrong but i did not intentionally move to mislead anybody i am in this race to stay i am in this race to win
7030916 biden admits plagiarism in school but says it was not malevolent

7030936 we are trying to use diplomatic means to release sailors of the hijacked iranian ship which was carrying 40 000 tons of iron ore from china to the netherlands
7030937 you could have had jp 8 in there and i wouldnt have known the difference
7030938 the problem itself terror and iran is like a swamp with mosquitos its preferable to dry out the swamp than try to kill every single mosquito
7030939 when the price of oil rises the terrorist organizations feel better the feeling needs to be brought back down the way to bring iran venezuela and even russia in some respects down is to lower the price of oil attacking oil fields is foolish we can attack with energy meaning create alternative energy
7030940 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7030941 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7030942 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7030943 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7030944 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7030945 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7030946 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7030947 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7030948 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7030949 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7030950 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7030951 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7030952 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7030953 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7030954 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7030955 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7030956 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7030957 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7030958 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7030959 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7030960 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7030961 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7030962 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7030963 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7030964 honest hard working knowledgeable folks willing to make the hard decisions for the good of the nation
7030965 sorry as you know i have argued long and hard for you to get the help you deserve but the b ds in the house of representatives have turned down every one of my proposals we need your votes to kick these b ds out of office
7030966 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7030967 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7030968 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7030969 this is a planning took where all things are going
7030970 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7030971 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7030972 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7030973 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7030974 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7030975 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7030976 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
7030977 to be nobody but yourself in a world which is working night and day to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and never stop fighting
7030978 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never
7030979 the secret lies in being brave enough everyday to embrace the truth that whispers constantly from within
7030980 my friendship is eternal my ability to care at all costs is immeasurable my heart soul and spirits depth belong to only one man i am a woman of truth even in my humanness and i will always be perfectly flawed
7030981 freedom soars on wings outstretched upon the wind of kindness but limitless is the sky when feathers have been strengthened by honest self reflection
7030982 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7030983 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7030984 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7030985 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7030986 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7030987 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7030988 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7030989 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7030990 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7030991 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7030992 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7030993 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7030994 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7030995 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7030996 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7030997 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7030998 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7030999 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7031000 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7031001 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7031002 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7031003 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7031004 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7031005 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7031006 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7031007 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7031008 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7031009 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7031010 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7031011 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7031012 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7031013 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7031014 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7031015 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7031016 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7031017 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7031018 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7031019 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7031020 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7031021 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7031022 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7031023 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7031024 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7031025 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7031026 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7031027 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7031028 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7031029 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7031030 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7031031 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7031032 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7031033 if i can do procedures for myself that have proven effective for a large number of people over extended periods of time and i do those procedures every day or several times every day is that more likely to help me than 1 2 or 3 hours week
7031034 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7031035 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7031036 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7031037 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7031038 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

7031058 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7031059 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7031060 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7031061 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
7031062 wants people to shift their responses beyond the man standing in front of the tank
7031063 i am impressed by the cosmopolitan atmosphere i didnt think it would be so urban and so advanced
7031064 in england ive probably had about 20 or 30 front pages in last two and a half years and what interests me is what else happened on those same days and how much our government is getting away with day after day

7031102 it is more than bidens years in the senate that recommend him during the democratic primary debates the phrase joe is right was heard so often that it became the theme of his ultimately failed campaign
7031103 since he entered the senate in 1973 at the age of 30 biden has embodied the kind of brains character and compassion that national politics should have but rarely gets now at 65 he would bring to obamas ticket the good judgment and experience a change candidate needs to persuade wary voters that the best of the past would not be swept away in enthusiasm for the new
7031104 in the bitter campaign ahead republicans would have a harder time persuading voters of their candidates superiority on national security against a ticket anchored by bidens five year record of attempting to resolve the political knots in iraq rather than pushing on with mccains mindless flag waving about victory that is still costing american lives and billions of dollars

7031114 al qaeda in iraq will face a continuous assault from all sides
7031115 the mass violence in the country underscores the chilling fact that the most dangerous place in iraq is not the mosque the marketplace or the military checkpoint but the classroom
7031116 its great that the city was able to get this school opened up
7031117 the school is going to be a wonderful institution not only for the students but for all of ramadi as the youth of the city continue to earn an education they will assist the city and the province in making their country prosperous
7031118 this is a great step to work towards the future in abu tshir
7031119 when kids return to the school and see it is in good condition they will be very happy
7031120 it also makes the teachers have better lessons for the kids
7031121 we are just glad to be able to help and let the ia take the lead with the combined medical engagement
7031122 hopefully every clinic in thawra 1 will get repeated visits from the ia as they are operating with more independence every day
7031123 with the removal of these weapons off the streets we are directly saving lives of iraqi citizens and coalition forces
7031124 there are still some issues to work out but its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
7031125 the reason we are where we are today talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger and we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
7031126 there wasnt a doubt in my mind that we were hit no confusion it was very clear
7031127 i thought there was the possibility that someone was in there spc thaddeus lake specifically
7031128 col saeed and the 4 31st battalion conducted successful operations in babahani and the bouharat
7031129 great work by col saeed and his staff that is certainly indicative of the potential of this battalion in conducting ever larger independent operations
7031130 we are here to help provide basic medical services to the iraqi people by getting the iraqi army and iraqi civilians to work together
7031131 i am very happy to help out the iraqi families
7031132 it doesnt cost money to play you just need a ball and a field all of the children in this region can come to this stadium and play a game
7031133 hundreds of ramadi citizens have told me they would dream of seeing the stadium return to its past glory and to be able to play soccer there again
7031134 they thought that dream would never come true but with the help of 1st battalion 9th marines and other coalition forces throughout the years the stadium was rebuilt and their dreams have been fulfilled
7031135 the people of this village have been wary of the coalition forces for the past several years because they have seen units come and go and promises made that were never fulfilled
7031136 we wanted to assure them that we were different and to help prove our resolve we lived among them in their impoverished community experiencing for a short time the life they have always known
7031137 we knew it was unfortunate that the georgians had to leave but it provided us with the opportunity to take an active role in securing the checkpoints along the main routes in wasit
7031138 we are working hand in hand with our iraqi partners
7031139 they have the lead in running the traffic control points and we plan on training them in patrol base operations temporary traffic control points and presence patrols around their respective patrol bases
7031140 the people of wasit need to know that the iraqi army is here to help maintain their safety and security and we are very fortunate to have our great friends the americans by our side in this mission
7031141 its the first time weve scrubbed in with any iraqis
7031142 anything we do to help build their medical capacity is a good use of our time and facilities
7031143 it does my heart good that when i showed up here and started talking to the leaders we discussed education and government and not once talked about security
7031144 this is a huge step in this area because it proves that weve turned a corner and are now focusing on rebuilding western al anbar province
7031145 a lot of these men come from different tribes and different backgrounds
7031146 when they enter their office they must take off the tribal robe and perform as public servants for the whole district theyre still adapting and our job is to help them through the transition
7031147 there are still some issues to work out but its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
7031148 the reason we are where we are today talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger and we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
7031149 and we can look forward to an agreement or we can look forward to a set of circumstances in which we know what is needed in the future in terms of roles responsibilities numbers
7031150 we are very close to finalize this important agreement for iraq for the region and for the friendship and the partnership of iraq and the united states
7031151 people who have been limited on their water supply within the city will soon not have to worry about such issues
7031152 the pipeline attaches the al rasheed water treatment plant to the water tower in mahmudiyah in order to bring potable water to the city
7031153 this is a shared project between coalition forces and the iraqi government
7031154 the local water director came to us and identified demand for water in mahmudiyah as well as excess supply in al rasheed we provided the pipe and the goi is providing the funding for the installation testing and connection of the pipe everything but the pipe itself
7031155 the government of iraq did the technical piece of the project so that it was completed to their standards and their specifications
7031156 operation iraqi children is a wonderful way for the people of the u s to help the children of iraq and by doing so we are helping our soldiers who are working so hard over there
7031157 the kits have been a huge hit with the local children
7031158 the kits have also given the maneuver units and police transition team a positive avenue to interact with local children with our iraqi counterparts
7031159 on average they see 60 to 70 patients a day
7031160 they have a very nice facility here and they do very good work
7031161 our country suffered through three decades of war and when the diag program started here in panjshir the district of anaba became a district of peace
7031162 those weapons that we used to fight against our enemies are the same weapons that we handed in for the diag program
7031163 this is a province known for its history of fighting the good fight and now our fight is for both peace and reconstruction
7031164 and that is why the diag process worked very well here in anaba and is continuing to work throughout panjshir
7031165 we hope that the next district of panjshir becomes peaceful and then the next and the next and soon all of afghanistan will not think of the people of panjshir only as the fighters they once were

7031301 we americans can be misled by the major media were being told the soviets are striving to achieve a comparatively low standard of living compared with ours but actually they have reached a basic stability in meeting their needs and are now planning to double their production
7031302 the key to their soviet system is the focus on groups not individuals they say it is the people together not leading privileged individuals who make the nation happen
7031303 has tended to ignore or distort the gains that have been made by the soviets since the russian revolution of 1917 but in fact the soviets are carrying out a policy to resolve the inequalities between nationalities inequalities that they say were inherited from capitalist and czarist rule they have a comprehensive affirmative action program which they have stuck to religiously if i can use that word since 1917

7031516 i thought only a few would come forward everyone came up and they kept coming up each first sunday year after year and were still doing so when i retired i was told we had some physical healings but people came again and again because they sensed gods power in the sacrament of healing deep healing was taking place and people felt it or they could not have continued to come again and again lives were changed

7031555 thanks to this the money will go into the protection of the malagasy environment instead of to france
7031556 this is a new dawn for our people and for all peruvians who wish to develop in liberty not in oppression
7031557 it definitely is not put on its a very emotional show to work on
7031558 you have a huge responsibility to a lot of people and everybody gets over emotional its draining it takes so much out of you emotionally
7031559 ive had lambs eyes i popped them in my mouth and chewed through them fortunately they did us the honour of removing them from the lamb first
7031560 they gave me live swamp worms to eat you hold one end and squeeze down the body to get rid of the sand and then pop it in your mouth i had three though i didnt spend much time savouring the flavour
7031561 this is the filthiest most impractical and expensive way you could ever dream up to make fuel
7031562 the growing awareness of americans that they need to reduce their dependence on foreign oil
7031563 i cant believe amy winehouse self harms shes so irritating she must be able to find someone to do it for her
7031564 i am absolutely delighted i know self harming is not funny but its just a joke so im not going to beat myself up about it
7031565 clearly they both want to know what chesters got that they didnt have
7031566 im going to have liposuction because after four kids i need it im also going to have a boob reduction
7031567 she will be followed by a camera crew but she has wanted this for a really long time regardless of whether it was for tv or not
7031568 the money is there she is not broke by any means
7031569 we are supporting pakistan the event must be in pakistan i dont think we will change our stance at the moment i dont think the indian board will change its view in the present circumstances
7031570 i dont think it will be divided i think there will be a solution on this
7031571 i definitely want to get something bad on the road the vehicle must be big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
7031572 im stoked mostly everyone dresses up on their sweet 16 not me im going to be ready to get in the water and ready get on the crazy rides thats all i want to do the entire time is ride the rides
7031573 these guys who say i cant wait to retire hot dog and after about a week theyre ready to pull their hair out keep busy and youll stay younger and healthier and youll be around a hell of a lot longer
7031574 he and sadie have been over for ages but hes the father of her children and really a no go area for romance if you want to stay in with the posse its sort of gang rules
7031575 he watched only her performance then walked backstage to the meet and greet area
7031576 but when he saw people start to recognize him he hid it was real obvious he didnt want people to know he was there to see taylor
7031577 he was hanging upside down his body was inside the house and he was stuck in the window with his foot outside
7031578 the more he struggled the more he got jammed when i got home he still had the hammer in his hand which he had used to smash the main window and get some leverage
7031579 he was screaming to get him down and we were all saying i dont think so
7031580 alicia put some electric energy into her breath that cemented itself into the magnetic tape very inspiring to watch
7031581 gave me a new voice and i wasnt myself any more
7031582 i drummed for her voice and she mimicked the guitar tones then we joined our voices and screamed and moaned about these characters in the film and their isolation having no one to trust not even themselves maybe we became them for a few minutes
7031583 theres not much communication between the two the campaign wants to see the text but its been slow in coming they dont want headlines about a clinton snub to obama
7031584 you could argue that nobody is qualified to be president
7031585 bill clinton does not think barack obama will be a great president and he doesnt want to say so but hes a pro hell give an endorsement he also likes doing things last minute and he likes to just go out there and say whats on his mind
7031586 how could they expect any woman in her right mind to pay to go out with them theyre hardly brad pitt james bond or richard gere in american gigolo are they
7031587 as far as i am concerned i am good looking when i walk down the road in wakefield i get women coming up to me and i have to turn them down i know for a fact that i can get women we think weve been conned weve paid out all this money and not had one call or date
7031588 we thought it would be easy money and wed have a good time but its all gone wrong we dont see ourselves like richard gere we were just looking at it as a chance to socialise and get some female company we werent after sex just a good night out and some money
7031589 the agency said that after 48 hours if we hadnt had any offers wed get our money back we kept calling to find out why no clients had got in touch and asking for our money back but they said we had to wait until next july
7031590 our guarantee actually states that if we cant find work within 48 hours we will return the money at the end of the registration period which is one year weve given them quite a few opportunities but there are lots of things theyre not willing to do
7031591 the government expects russia to complete the withdrawal immediately in accordance with the six point plan also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev and pull back its troops to the lines held before the outbreak of hostilities as was agreed
7031592 according to our information russia has begun its withdrawal from georgia but not completed it
7031593 its cynical to say that chr tien is criticizing harper because he has post retirement china business ties
7031594 he has been consistent from the beginning and many of the most effective chinese human rights issues were solved under the liberal government
7031595 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7031596 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7031597 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7031598 we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7031599 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7031600 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7031601 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7031602 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7031603 its a well intended notion he has but its a very naive way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7031604 i mean youve got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a story book man
7031605 i think theyve really lost faith in the american people in terms of leveling with them
7031606 its not even so much they dont trust which is a piece of it
7031607 the way to win is the bill clinton triangulation and the karl rove angering
7031608 its the thesis that you go to your base because people dont vote well why dont they vote
7031609 rich folks are as patriotic as poor folks but we dont talk that way

7031616 akibat belum menerima haknya selama tiga bulan jangan harap manajemen bisa memaksakan para pemain bisa tampil all out di kompetisi divisi utama
7031617 namun hingga saat ini manajemen belum bersedia memberi keterangan kepada pemain tentang belum adanya gaji pemain selama tiga bulan
7031618 saya mendengarnya miris juga mengingat mereka sebelum bergabung dengan persiraja berada di manajemen saya tetapi sekarang mereka sudah berada di manajemen persiraja yang bertanggung jawab terhadap pemain
7031619 beberapa waktu lalu saya mendapat keluhan serupa dari pemain saya tetapi kok kini mereka mengeluh lagi berarti yang gaji semenjak mereka bergabung pun tidak dibayar hingga saat ini

7031639 an 80 yard touchdown by boyd in the fourth was the only time the green wave would find the end zone
7031640 unc recruit justin dixon led sss in rushing with 106 yards gained on 19 carries with a touchdown
7031641 hunter furr and denard jones took control furr who is north carolina bound slashed and bulled his way for 128 yards and four touchdowns on 24 carries

7031643 moss who would later scored on an 11 yard run in the fourth finished with 94 yards
7031644 rose s fourth down pass from the bees 30 intended for taylor grubbs was tipped by defensive back jay graham and intercepted by thomas to squelch the final threat

7031652 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime

7031659 una ong viene y regala zapatos a los ni os hace fotos de los zapatos nuevos muy bien pero los zapatos se gastan o se les quedan peque os el problema es que lo nico que abordan es el s ntoma y tres a os despu s la ong se va y la comunidad se siente enga ada porque en secreto la gente esperaba que la ong le dejase proponer sus propias ideas y luego le diera ayuda econ mica para resolver sus problemas necesitamos ayuda econ mica por supuesto pero dirigida a unas necesidades que nosotros mismos tenemos que especificar si la ong lo hace todo nuestra gente se vuelve pasiva y eso no sirve de nada
7031660 creo que el mundo est demasiado obsesionado con los derechos humanos y se ha olvidado de la dignidad humana regalar zapatos es paternalista prefiero caminar descalzo que ser humillado de esa forma quiz tarde un poco en poder comprarme mis zapatos pero cuando lo haga escoger los que quiera y los cuidar y los querr porque los valorar como fruto de mis esfuerzos muchas ong son como zapatos que no sientan bien un color equivocado una forma que no va y nunca vamos a quererlos

7031663 clearly reading in print and on the internet are different on paper text has a predetermined beginning middle and end where readers focus for a sustained period on one authors vision on the internet readers skate through cyberspace at will and in effect compose their own beginnings middles and ends

7031690 en broeder en zuster de boer hoe staat het met uw persoonlijk geloofsleven
7031691 ja het valt niet altijd mee je staat er niet altijd bij stil
7031692 je schiet toch altijd weer te kort je twijfelt wel eens
7031693 want gij hebt niet ontvangen een geest van slavernij om opnieuw te vrezen maar gij hebt ontvangen de geest van het zoonschap door welke wij roepen abba vader
7031694 want alzo lief heeft god de wereld gehad dat hij zijn eniggeboren zoon gegeven heeft opdat een ieder die in hem gelooft niet verloren ga maar eeuwig leven hebbe
7031695 christus is gestorven voor onze zonden hij is begraven en ten derde dage opgewekt naar de schriften en hij is verschenen aan cefas daarna aan de twaalven vervolgens is hij verschenen aan meer dan vijfhonderd broeders tegelijk
7031696 jezus zei ik ben de weg en de waarheid en het leven niemand komt tot de vader dan door mij
7031697 want door genade zijt gij behouden door het geloof en dat niet uit uzelf het is een gave van god niet uit werken opdat niemand roeme
7031698 word niet gelijkvormig aan deze wereld maar word hervormd door de vernieuwing van uw denken opdat gij moogt erkennen wat de wil van god is
7031699 hoor je zijn stem krijg je een visioen spreekt hij in een droom tot je
7031700 bedenk toch hoe groot de liefde is die de vader ons heeft geschonken wij worden kinderen van god genoemd en dat zijn we ook
7031701 het is nooit leuk op de bank te zitten ik heb een maand geleden een blessure gehad vorige week ben ik in de tweede helft ingevallen en deze week heb ik alle dagen getraind ik had verwacht te spelen de trainer heeft besloten dat niet te doen meer wil ik er eigenlijk niet over zeggen op tv ik heb vandaag genoeg gezegd met mijn voeten
7031702 ik vind het lekkerder om in een aanvallende ploeg te spelen in de wedstrijden die we tot nu toe wonnen hebben we veel geluk gehad we spelen verdedigend vandaag hebben we echter genoeg kansen gehad maar die zijn er niet in gegaan gelukkig maakte ik hem wel
7031703 we waren niet bij de les en dan word je in het internationale tophockey keihard afgerekend we maakten domme fouten en hadden te weinig discipline om deze wedstrijd gewoon goed te spelen
7031704 daar heb ik niets aan toe te voegen op belangrijke momenten gaven we vandaag niet thuis en dat was kenmerkend voor het hele toernooi
7031705 in spite of economic constraints in some markets like the united states on a worldwide basis servers continued to grow in the second quarter of the year said jeffrey hewitt research vice president at gartner
7031706 outgrowing homegrown is your in house billing system hampering your growth
7031707 sun is a large ship in mid turn and its low share price technology and customers could make it an attractive target to some larger players
7031708 theres a definite value in the technology that sun owns theres a ton of intellectual property
7031709 whenever people ask what is suns future then obviously the potential to be acquired comes in
7031710 i could be wrong but i think management is far more focused on fixing the business rather than selling the company
7031711 we are making changes to deliver consistent and expanding profitability
7031712 although the last two quarters were tough for sun we continue to see great progress
7031713 operationally i think sun is going down the right path but i just dont think the growth is being seen as quickly as investors want to see it
7031714 thats been out there for ages at least for the past decade
7031715 there is no doubt that the companys technology talent customer base and brand still command respect in the industry
7031716 if an acquirer could buy sun at a discounted price and then execute or facilitate the turnaround that has been close or elusive for sun it could represent a significant payoff
7031717 you can do it without money but obviously it helps it gives you space
7031718 als ik heel eerlijk ben tegen mezelf moet ik ja zeggen ik wilde zo graag winnen maar ik heb vanaf het begin met mezelf afgesproken dat nummer twee ook goed zou zijn nummer drie niet dus ik ben tevreden ik kan optreden ik doe interviews ik doe waar ik van droomde ik had ook thuis kunnen zitten en niks doen
7031719 ik dacht dit is het moment waarop ik acht maanden heb gewacht en het duurde zo lang mijn naam en die van nicky beginnen allebei met een n dus martijn zei en de winnaar is nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn en ik dacht ja wat nnnnnnn icky toen dacht ik dat ik niet meer leefde ik stond er wel maar ik was niet meer daar
7031720 nou ja de rest was ook hartstikke goed en ik wist niet waar ze bij idols naar zochten daarom had ik niet gedacht dat ik tot het einde zou blijven dat hangt van zo veel dingen af of de jury je leuk vindt wat het publiek vindt je weet nooit wat er gebeurt
7031721 ik wist helemaal niet dat ik auditie moest doen mijn nichtje had me ingeschreven ik was een beetje eigenwijs en ik zei waarom moet ik daar gaan staan en tegen me laten zeggen wat er niet goed is en ik kwam uit de gospelmuziek dus wat moest ik daar doen ik durfde niet in de wereld van de popmuziek te gaan kijken toen vroeg mijn nichtje wat mijn geboortedatum was en die gaf ik alleen maar omdat ik hoopte dat ik een cadeautje zou krijgen twee weken later zei ze dat ik was uitgenodigd ik schreeuwde nog dat ik niet zou gaan toen schreeuwde mijn nichtje terug we zijn het zat je hebt talent en je zit thuis ga het proberen tsja toen moest ik wel
7031722 het verhaal van mijn leven is lang je krijgt de korte versie ik ben geboren in congo net als mijn hele familie mijn vader zat in de politiek en kreeg problemen met het regime we moesten vluchten en kwamen in nederland terecht toen ik drie maanden oud was ging ik met mijn familie in rotterdam wonen
7031723 door de kerk daar ontstond makoma een gospelband makoma is onze familienaam en de band bestond dan ook uit mijn broers en zussen we gingen altijd naar de afrikaanse kerk waar mijn oom priester was daar was geen koor dus vond mijn oom dat mijn broers maar moesten pianospelen en drummen tegen ons zei hij meiden probeer te zingen dat deden we de hele dag
7031724 ik denk ongeveer zeven jaar toen wist ik ook meteen dat ik geboren ben om muzikant te worden met die droom ben ik nog steeds bezig
7031725 we waren best populair we voegden onze eigen invloeden toe aan de gospel dat was veel hiphop in de afrikaanse gospelmuziek was dat nieuw dus iedereen begon over ons te praten we wonnen een aanmoedigingsprijs en zijn daardoor bijna overal in afrika geweest om op te treden maar ook in australi fiji canada azi overal zes jaar geleden is makoma gestopt ik wilde naar wat anders op zoek net als de rest denk ik mensen hebben altijd aan mij getwijfeld hoe kan een christelijke vrouw zon bos haar hebben en tattoos en piercings ik had geen thuis was aan het zoeken waar moest ik heen
7031726 ja ik geniet echt van alles wat er nu gebeurt hier heb ik altijd van gedroomd journalisten stellen me vragen ik ben op tv ik mag zingen en mensen vermaken als ik over straat loop vragen mensen mijn handtekening of willen met me op de foto heerlijk natuurlijk ben ik ook wel eens moe en heb ik er geen zin in maar het hoort erbij als ik kan kiezen tussen de telefoon opnemen op een helpdesk en de wereld entertainen dan heb ik dat er graag voor over
7031727 in de muziekindustrie moet je geduldig zijn maar je moet als mens in het leven altijd weten waar je heen gaat als je dat niet weet val je in een gat dat je niet zag je moet van tevoren weten wat je wilt bereiken en wat je k n bereiken als ik nu niet hard werk komt over een jaar niemand me meer interviewen actief blijven ik wil het cht maken op n podium staan met beyonc justin timberlake en tina turner ik wil grammy awards winnen
7031728 dat moet ook vind ik dat is niet arrogant ofzo je moet groot denken om er voor te kunnen werken als je klein denkt blijf je ook klein dan verdwijn je ergens achter een helpdesk
7031729 nee nederland is mijn land hier wil ik alles bereiken hier wil ik groot worden en daarna kan ik overal groot worden en dan zeggen ze wauw zij is een nederlandse zangeres voor die eer doe ik het
7031730 laten we hopen dat ik er patent op heb ik wil nog heel vaak matchwinnaar worden
7031731 de week voor heracles had ik slechts tweemaal kunnen trainen ik kwam terug van een blessure die ik had opgelopen in het duel met de graafschap de afgelopen week heb ik geen training gemist en ik ging er dan ook vanuit dat ik in de basis zou starten ik zie mezelf niet als wisselspeler
7031732 linksback haim megrelishvili gaf een voorzet het was een moeilijke bal die ik gelukkig goed aannam ik zag de keeper vanuit een ooghoek komen ik passeerde hem en schoot de bal vanuit een lastige hoek in het doel ik moet de goal nog maar eens terugkijken op televisie mijn moeder neemt normaal gesproken alle wedstrijden van vitesse op dus dat komt wel goed
7031733 nee niet echt ik ben niet zon feestbeest ik doe het rustig aan
7031734 ik weet niet of we die hoge notering de komende weken vast kunnen houden maar ik vind niet dat vitesse een ploeg is die altijd in de top vijf hoeft te staan als we zesde staan ben ik ook tevreden
7031735 dat heeft te maken met het spelsysteem de trainer kiest voor een verdedigend concept we staan op de vierde plaats dus je kunt niet zeggen dat dat een foute keuze is verdedigend staat het goed dat zag je ook vandaag willem ii heeft nauwelijks kansen gehad de spaarzame kansen die wij krijgen moeten er gewoon in want veel kansen krijgen we normaal gesproken niet al moet ik zeggen dat dat vandaag tegen willem ii anders was
7031736 ik had het lorca gegund maar eigenlijk gun ik het iedereen die bij vitesse speelt als iemand anders er beter voorstaat dan leg ik de bal af zo ben ik
7031737 en negatief vind ik het ook niet klinken natuurlijk had ik ook liever lang bij een club gezeten neem iemand als raul die speelt zijn hele leven al bij real madrid of paolo maldini die alleenmaar voor ac milan gevoetbald heeft erg mooi
7031738 maar aan het zwervers bestaan als voetballer zitten ook positieve kanten zo ben ik veel sneller volwassen geworden heb ook veel meer levenservaring opgedaan je maakt in korte tijd zoveel verschillende mensen situaties en omgevingen mee van het telkens niet uitdienen van mijn contract ben ik als persoon veel sterker geworden en daardoor ben ik een betere voetballer geworden het is echt geen toeval dat de laatste twee jaar eerst bij fc zwolle en daarna bij ado den haag mijn beste seizoenen ooit waren nadeel van die hele rits clubs is het verhuisen in al die jaren ben ik in totaal negen keer verhuisd dat is een gedoe niet alleen voor mij maar ook voor mijn ouders die helpen mij namelijk altijd onlangs zeiden ze al met een knipoog blijf de komende tijd maar eens in arnhem wonen dat ga ik ook doen ik houd mijn huidige huis in den haag aan maar neem ook een appartement in arnhem dat betekend dus dat ik voor de tiende keer zal gaan verhuizen het verhuizen verklaart ook een beetje dat ik bijna altijd vrijgezel ben geweest en door het steeds verkassen heb ik ook niet veel vrienden al probeer ik de vrienden die ik heb wel zo vaak mogelijk op te zoeken binding krijgen met de buren is ook moeilijk bouw je daar eindelijk een band mee op moet je alweer weg voordeel van al het verhuizen is wel weer dat ik als de beste kan inrichten ik ben inmiddels een goede binnenhuisarchitect
7031739 ik ben gewend om bij een nieuwe club te komen op den duur pas je je steeds sneller aan ik probeer gewoon mezelf te zijn ik ben weliswaar nog maar 25 maar loop al we leen tijdje mee de meeste spelers ken ik al of ik heb er tegen gespeeld of ik zat met in een ploeg dat maakt het allemaal wel wat eenvoudiger kom altijd wel een bekende tegen je kunt ook in 1 stad blijven wonen maar dan moet je wel over de nodige disipline beschikken neem mijn periode bij fc zwolle bijvoorbeeld ik was net samen gaan wonen in den haag met een meisje uit tilburg die had veel moeite gedaan om zich in den haag te vestigen en dan ga je ook niet direct weer weg dus ben ik dagelijks op en neer gegaan elke ochtend om zes uur op ik woonde het verst weg maar ik was wel elke dag als eerste op de club als je dat doet word je ook eerder in de groep opgenomen omdat ze zien dat je er alles aan doet om iets te bereiken er word weleens gezegd dat ik geen discipline heb of geen knokker ben nou als er een iemand disipline heeft en er altijd voor gaat ben ik het wel dat ik iedere keer ergens weer weg moest was absoluut geen kwestie van niet aan kunnen of willen passen integendeel ik heb in brabant gespeeld in rotterdam in zwolle daar zitten allemaal verschillende types met telkens weer een compleet andere mentaliteit maar ik voelde met overal direct thuis alleen in heerenveen was dat niet zo maar ik was toen nog te jong en te naief om met een heel andere cultuur om te gaan ik had toen ook veel meer moeten genieten ik mocht mee naar de uitwedstrijden in champions league tegen valensia olympque lyon en olympia kos ook al was ik geen basis speler dat is toch mooi om mee te maken ik had toen moeten denken waar maak ik me druk over ik ben net 18 zit bij een fantastiche club maar in plaats daarvan zat ik me te verbijten op de bank en ja als je er dan in komt ga je geforceerd voetballen en dan lukt het niet fobbe de haan had kennelijk ook geen vertrouwen in me want hij stelde me nauwlijks op iets waar ik het toen uiteraard niet mee eens was als ik twee weken goed had getraind liep ik al bij fobbe naar binnen en vroeg waarom ik niet speelde dat botste dus maar ja dan kun je wel een mooi leven en een mooi contract bij heerenveen hebben het belangrijkste is dat je aan spelen toekomt om die reden heb ik me steeds weer laten verhuren aan een lagere club waar ik wel aan spelen toe zou komen naturlijk is dat pijnlijk ook omdat er grote verwachtingen waren sommigen hadden het al over een nieuwe ster toen ik als talent naar heerenveen ging iemand die snel oranje zou halen maar ja dan moet je dat ook laten zien en dat heb ik niet gedaan ik ging nogal eens op mijn bek dat heb ik aan mezelf te danken maar achteraf is het wel goed geweest het heeft me gebracht waar ik nu ben waarom vitesse voor mij heeft gekozen kwestie van presteren als je dat niet doet in deze wereld kom je niet verder dat had ik de laatste twee jaar wel gedaan welliswaar degradeerden we met ado den haag maar ik draaide wel een goed seizoen waardoor ik in the picture kwam bij vitesse en fc twente uiteidenlijk heb ik voor mijn gevoel gekozen bovendien sprak uit de aanbieding van vitesse meer waardering ik tekende voor 4 seizoenen ja toen we eruit waren zei ik wel waar om in godsnaam 4 jaar over een jaar ben ik toch weer weg maar dat was natuurlijk een dolletje ik heb niet de intentie om aan het eind van het seizoen vitesse alweer te verlaten daarvoor is het een te mooie club ik kan me dan ook wel voorstellen dat ik hier wel mijn contract uitdien het is voor anderen misschien moeilijk voor te stellen dat ik dat ga doen omdat het nog nooit gebeurd is maar waarom niet natuurlijk mister vitesse zal ik nooit worden beslist niet maar dat ik hier een mooie tijd kan beleven staat als een paal boven water
7031740 when you are surrounded by a fleet of battleships all taking aim at you the possibility of a submarine is not really a problem
7031741 how can you be sure you dont infringe on someone elses patent
7031742 the fact is that these standards have known patent pools they are listed in the documents on the web sites even in the press releases
7031743 if youre limited to an executive summary flowchart of no more than 10 boxes that fit on one page youd be hard pressed to tell the differences between any of these codecs the differences are all in the details of course the details are very important
7031744 the claim that building on top of h 261 frees you from patent concerns and thats a reason to use h 261 over theora is dubious as theora is based on a codec of approximately the same age the truth is that as soon as you start trying to move forward using any of the discoveries published since then you immediately run into patent concerns again
7031745 part of the problem is that there is no legal test for unencumbered nor do you have to be infringing to get sued we will always have a halting problem here and yet both vorbis and theora are 10 years old with no claims against them would another 10 be sufficient twenty vague threats that come to nothing nothing that is except eliminating the monopoly interests competition are the story of my professional life patent law is being used to extort outright and most of the interests represented here are willingly buying into it this isnt even getting to the trolls and we sit around and wonder why this industry is so dysfunctional
7031746 we dont accept the stock answers on fud such as how can you ever be sure you arent violating a patent you can be sure by doing a taxonomy you dig into the process and ask questions
7031747 mortgage debt is viewed as much riskier now than it was a couple of years ago during the housing boom

7031760 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here

7031771 i knew i had the chance to do something that no one had achieved before i am proud of it because i am giving this to a country that loves football
7031772 i felt good the team grew during the tournament we had our best performance in the first half against the netherlands and in the game against brazil
7031773 we did not play well the climate had a lot to do with it and we suffered until the last minute
7031774 now i am going to try to improve but what i have already lived through is quite something today i thought of my wife of my daughter this is especially for her because she was still not born when i won in athens
7031775 the games are the utmost celebration of sport and having been at two is a privilege particularly these which were the best in history
7031776 we were very far away but we tried to make the most of every second i was struck by the organization how they took care of every detail they have done very well and we have seen unusual things like that achieved by michael phelps that is why these games will go down in history
7031777 one more iaf helicopter in addition to earlier two joined in the relief efforts the state governments relief operation continued for the third day today with air dropping of relief packets in the three worst hit districts where the situation remains grave
7031778 its naive to think that some people wont be looking at the cup the week after but we want a home semi in the play offs and that means we need to keep on winning
7031779 we have played some pretty desperate teams in the past couple of weeks but the giants will be a different proposition
7031780 they cannot get into the play offs and that means they will be relaxed and will probably play more expansively that can be hard to play against
7031781 theyve obviously made it an environment where the players are comfortable and want to play for them and they want to play with each other because their form has improved
7031782 they had a very good team on paper at the start of the year and i think everyone is pretty surprised that theyve finished where they have
7031783 you have to go in with some decent form in the play offs to progress in them and we were massively disappointed about the game
7031784 but that is gone and hopefully we will learn from it there is a little bit of pressure off us now were in the play offs the bonus would be getting a home time and thats what were after

7031804 tra lui e il papa san pio x era venuta a formarsi una cortina fumogena di malintesi di dubbi di sospetti che altri allinsaputa dei due santi in nome di una miope intransigenza e con disinvoltura poco scrupolosa avevano reso pi densa e pi cupa cos avvenne che il santo cardinale ebbe molto da soffrire non solo per la chiesa ma dalla chiesa e precisamente dal papa san pio x al papa pareva non solo che larcivescovo di milano fosse troppo tiepido nella lotta contro il modernismo e troppo remissivo verso i modernisti ma che talvolta rasentasse la slealt il peggio si che i sentimenti del papa trapelavano e di bocca in bocca giungevano a milano e taluni del clero e del laicato per dimostrarsi amanti del papa ritiravano il cuore e la stima dal loro arcivescovo
7031805 quando si voglia infatti e pur senza prevenire giudizi che sono ancora il segreto di dio chiedere alla liturgia della chiesa un pensiero che riassuma tutto il cardinale ferrari nella sua persona e nella sua edificante attivit pastorale subito ci soccorrono le belle parole pronunciate in onore dei pontefici santi ecce sacerdos magnus qui in diebus suis placuit deo et inventus est iustus et in tempore iracundiae factus est reconciliatio

7031809 ik zie het er het nut niet van in dat ik hier elke dag om zes uur moet zitten
7031810 ik begrijp niet precies wat je bedoelt ik dacht dat je niet wilde dat er iemand naast je kwam zitten
7031811 ik was in mezelf aan het zoeken naar een antwoord op de vraag of ik wel kan doen met mijn leven wat ik wil om elke dag op de trein te wachten in de kou vind ik niks
7031812 het is koud op het plein de winter doet zich al aardig gelden de mensen die voorbij lopen duiken allemaal lekker weg in hun winterjassen je denkt dan gelijk aan een elfstedentocht zullen de ijsmeesters hun positie op de bonkervaart al ingenomen hebben een glimlach verschijnt op mijn gezicht zo koud is het nou ook weer niet de winters op de schilderijen van anton pieck zijn echt voorbij ik kijk wat om me heen en zie dat het al donker wordt velen haasten zich naar hun stamppot dat lijkt me ook een goed plan heerlijk wegkruipen naast de verwarming met een bordje zuurkool met worst het heeft ook wel wat die winteravonden het hele gezin is dan binnen de hond vindt het heerlijk deze grote beren zijn afkomstig uit de koude gebieden van canada met die vacht voelt het lenteachtig aan de newfoundlander loopt mijn richting uit en laat zich zonder moeite aanlijnen we begeven ons op weg naar huis de lantaarnpalen verlichten onze terugtocht maar matig gelukkig lopen we hier vaker en kunnen we het bijna op de automatische piloot vinden ineens blinkt er een scherp flits in mijn ogen onweer als ik beter kijk zie ik een klein zilverachtig doosje vrolijk het licht weerkaatsen ik pak het op het ziet er prachtig uit ik ben nieuwsgierig wat er inzit op het moment dat ik het doosje wil openen krijg ik een enorme zet van achteren luttele tellen ben ik verdoofd de lik in mijn gezicht van de hond doet me beseffen dat ik gevallen ben als ik bij zinne kom zie ik een man met een regenjas hard wegrennen ik besef dan opeens dat het doosje uit mijn handen is gerukt
7031813 u zult enorm geschrokken zijn het was niet mijn bedoeling u te bezeren maar dat doosje ziet u dat is nogal belangrijk
7031814 ik kom uit canada mijn volk is de m tis mijn naam is shaman ik ben hier gekomen om mijn volk te redden de m tis is een inheemse bevolkingsgroep met zowel inheemse als europese voorouders alle inheemse volkeren van canada delen een diepgevoelde culturele trots en die dreigt nu teniet gedaan te worden ik ben in nederland omdat ik hierheen ben gezonden door de stamoudste hier zou ik iemand ontmoeten die ons kan helpen dat heeft hij gezien in een visioen eerst wist ik niet waar ik moest zoeken en hoe ik diegene zou herkennen toen u het doosje vond was mijn eerste reactie schrik ik moest het terug zien te krijgen het is heel belangrijk maar toen zag ik uw hond hij is van ons land u vond het doosje dat ik eerder deze dag verloren ben het kon geen toeval zijn u bent de uitverkorenen ik moet u vragen mee te gaan naar mijn land canada
7031815 dat kan niet ik moet werken en mijn gezin wat moet ik die vertellen als ze zo thuiskomen en mijn hond
7031816 uw hond moet mee hij is heel belangrijk hij kan mensen redden en uw werk is minder belangrijk dan u denkt ook voor u zal dit een waardevolle ervaring worden dat beloof ik u u zult uw leven heel anders in gaan delen
7031817 zij kunnen daar prima naar school het zal een goede levenservaring voor hen zijn
7031818 daar zal helaas geen tijd voor zijn u moet mee met of zonder gezin u heeft weinig keus want ik heb opdracht de uitverkorene desnoods tegen zijn zin mee te nemen
7031819 ik heb nog een vraag hoe komt het dat u zo goed nederlands spreekt
7031820 sorry ik kan geen vragen meer beantwoorden later zal alles u duidelijk zijn
7031821 it should be someone who is a national figure has national stature and is non partisan
7031822 it really kicked off with about 500m to go i was really relaxed and comfortable and i didnt want to go too early
7031823 but they were a little too ahead of me but if you had asked me this time last year whether i would be fourth in an olympic games i would not have believed you and i take heart from that

7031958 when you are surrounded by a fleet of battleships all taking aim at you the possibility of a submarine is not really a problem
7031959 how can you be sure you dont infringe on someone elses patent
7031960 the fact is that these standards have known patent pools they are listed in the documents on the web sites even in the press releases
7031961 if youre limited to an executive summary flowchart of no more than 10 boxes that fit on one page youd be hard pressed to tell the differences between any of these codecs the differences are all in the details of course the details are very important
7031962 the claim that building on top of h 261 frees you from patent concerns and thats a reason to use h 261 over theora is dubious as theora is based on a codec of approximately the same age the truth is that as soon as you start trying to move forward using any of the discoveries published since then you immediately run into patent concerns again
7031963 part of the problem is that there is no legal test for unencumbered nor do you have to be infringing to get sued we will always have a halting problem here and yet both vorbis and theora are 10 years old with no claims against them would another 10 be sufficient twenty vague threats that come to nothing nothing that is except eliminating the monopoly interests competition are the story of my professional life patent law is being used to extort outright and most of the interests represented here are willingly buying into it this isnt even getting to the trolls and we sit around and wonder why this industry is so dysfunctional
7031964 we dont accept the stock answers on fud such as how can you ever be sure you arent violating a patent you can be sure by doing a taxonomy you dig into the process and ask questions

7032044 the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
7032045 katy is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself at the moment
7032046 we cannot cut her out of our lives as she is our child but she knows we disagree strongly with what she is doing and the message she is promoting regarding homosexuality which the bible clearly states is a sin

7032090 we know for certain that narragansett bay is warmer on average and at the extremes than at any other time in recorded history
7032091 over the past 30 years the average mean temperature of the bay has gone up two degrees fahrenheit the average winter temperature has increased four degrees
7032092 warmer temperatures have caused dramatic changes at many levels and most have a distinctly negative environmental and economic impact
7032093 the bays animal and plant communities are fundamentally shifting critical habitats are threatened environmental quality and even public health and human life and property are jeopardized
7032094 they are nervous about the changes necessary as we move to a green economy
7032095 we are not responding as a society to this threat as rapidly as we should
7032096 that is coming on us with very very serious and broad implications it looks like its worse than people thought and the timeline for action is more urgent than many believe
7032097 and the rate at which it is occurring is unprecedented the natural response is outpacing our ability to predict the change which place all of us at a disadvantage that will have dire consequences unless we act quickly
7032098 it is unequivocal that climate change is happening and human conduct is the cause
7032099 narragansett bay is already seeing the effects of climate change sea level rise will occur but we must monitor this closely because both the timing and magnitude are still uncertain water temperatures will continue to increase and impact the coastal and bay ecosystems hurricane and tropical storm trends have the potential to inflict great damage and coupled with increased sea level we should be taking a precautionary approach so that coastal communities become resilient to the possible impacts
7032100 react more strongly to climate change if it had a face was considered immoral and was understood as a present danger with local impact
7032101 i really believed that my congressional colleagues on the committee would experience the same epiphany i had when they heard this great scientists clear analysis i couldnt have been more wrong the urgency simply didnt come across id seriously underestimated the resistance and disinterest this alarming prognosis of global warming would meet

7032117 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours

7032129 the day is coming when a single carrot freshly observed will set off a revolution
7032130 action video game play changes the way our brains process visual information
7032131 these games push the human visual system to the limits and the brain adapts to it that learning carries over into other activities and possibly everyday life
7032132 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record

7032142 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different

7032153 in those early pages and chapters anyone may find bold leaps to nowhere read the brave beginnings of dropped themes hear a tone since abandoned discover blind alleys track red herrings and laboriously learn a setting now false sometimes the writer leaves his early chapters in place from gratitude he cannot contemplate them or read them without feeling again the blessed relief that exalted him when the words first appeared relief that he was writing anything at all that beginning served to get him where he was going after all surely the reader needs it too as groundwork but no

7032155 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7032156 people say they like me people tell me they think id be a good president but that they just dont think i can win
7032157 he fought back beyond respectability and the fact that hes here today in this position is testament to his mettle
7032158 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7032159 i deeply regret any offense my remark might have caused anyone
7032160 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent its a point im not joking
7032161 the fact that he goes on for too long to explain his position or ask a question is to me irrelevant
7032162 theres no evidence that his verbosity has ever done anything to affect his judgment when it comes to his public responsibilities

7032170 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7032171 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7032172 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7032173 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7032174 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7032175 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7032176 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7032177 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7032178 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7032179 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7032180 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7032181 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7032182 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7032183 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7032184 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7032185 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7032186 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7032187 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7032188 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7032189 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7032190 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7032191 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7032192 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7032193 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7032194 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7032195 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7032196 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7032197 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7032198 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

7032205 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
7032206 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
7032207 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
7032208 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
7032209 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
7032210 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
7032211 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7032212 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7032213 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7032214 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7032215 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7032216 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7032217 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7032218 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman

7032222 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7032223 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7032224 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7032225 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7032226 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7032227 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7032228 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7032229 for those of you that arent aware theres a gametype in ut2k4 called vctf vehicle capture the flag if youve never played it you really are missing out on a great time

7032233 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
7032234 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
7032235 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
7032236 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7032237 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7032238 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7032239 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7032240 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7032241 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7032242 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7032243 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7032244 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7032245 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7032246 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7032247 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7032248 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7032249 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7032250 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7032251 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7032252 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7032253 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7032254 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7032255 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7032256 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
7032257 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
7032258 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
7032259 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
7032260 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
7032261 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7032262 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7032263 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7032264 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7032265 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7032266 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7032267 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7032268 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7032269 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7032270 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7032271 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7032272 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7032273 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7032274 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7032275 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7032276 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7032277 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7032278 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
7032279 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
7032280 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
7032281 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
7032282 any opportunity to promote the environment and preserve our planet is a step in the right direction
7032283 im very excited to be one of the first athletes to wear the nike trash talk i think people will love the shoe and hopefully by wearing it i can inspire others to try it out as well
7032284 i was really looking for a here and now solution to footwear waste and creating a performance product using waste materials felt like a very innovative solution using nikes considered design ethos i was able to create a shoe that stands up to the stringent on court performance requirements but is also more environmentally friendly
7032285 he doesnt have any experience and neither does his running mate
7032286 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
7032287 of course its been some sort of a different preparation to some other grand slams
7032288 its always tough in australia because you dont have many matches coming in
7032289 but im very much used to it not playing for four weeks or six weeks and then coming in and playing a big tournament so for me its not much of a change
7032290 ive been playing sets the last couple days you know which was very important for me to be able to play points im happy with my form to be honest very pleased physically im fine now too no more issues i would consider myself a hundred per cent
7032291 i practiced very well in dubai before coming here so i definitely you know created a good base for this fortnight
7032292 thats what i feel now when i get back on the practice courts you know i feel the way i would like to feel
7032293 tennis comes back very quickly you know its not like i havent been playing tennis for four weeks its only been one week i couldnt play tennis when you practice so hard like the way i did in dubai then you practice for a couple days youre right away back into things
7032294 thats for me important to know i feel like im moving well surface seems to again suit my game which is obviously important after all the talk about it now well see how it goes
7032295 its a great grand slam great facilities one of the best in the world
7032296 so i think they deserve it theyve been able to maintain great crowds and a great event for us players
7032297 for me it was a dream come true to get a chance to play at the garden its somewhere i never played at
7032298 pete really wanted to have an exhibition in the states as well so i said sure where should we do it sort of madison square garden came about
7032299 honestly it was just nice to hang out with him see what type of a person he is weve become friends you know it was very nice you know that we have obviously the record going on
7032300 i dont think it matters too much to us its just more about having respect and you know liking each other you know during that trip its the last exhibition we got planned and after that well see where it takes us
7032301 the danger always looms around you know the first few rounds because you know you want to get the feeling for the court the balls its been a year you come back with a lot of pressure trying to defend the points
7032302 theres always a lot of pressure but somehow i always get through you know i got the right approach and im confident i got different styles of play i can use you know to win matches
7032303 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7032304 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7032305 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7032306 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7032307 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7032308 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7032309 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7032310 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7032311 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7032312 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7032313 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7032314 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7032315 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7032316 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7032317 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7032318 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7032319 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7032320 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7032321 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7032322 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7032323 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7032324 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7032325 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7032326 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7032327 i get to watch surgeries standing right there looking over the doctors shoulder
7032328 he arrives before his shift is to begin and works longer than his shift if needed
7032329 brian will work extra hours and come in on his days off he will always go above and beyond without any questions asked
7032330 he has a fantastic sense of humor and is good for morale he can get along with all types of personalities he also trains other peri support staff
7032331 whats this about all that that passing gas in the camden middle school whats going on down there
7032332 someone heard it from five people who know two people who were really there and actually saw heard it
7032333 are willing to make a gesture to the fish namely by building a sandbank at some point along the new dike
7032334 we dont want to make a christmas tree out of it
7032335 the project can go ahead and cost money because in the end youll earn that back
7032336 after trying to practice on saturday afternoon i went to see the doctors and they immediately performed a series of tests the doctors have advised me that i should take a couple of days off and recuperate so that i am able to be 100 percent for the start of the australian open
7032337 zoey 101 star and sister of britney told ok magazine that shes pregnant and that the father is her boyfriend casey aldridge
7032338 it was a shock for both of us so unexpected
7032339 i was in complete and total shock and so was he
7032340 i definitely dont think its something you should do its better to wait
7032341 but i cant be judgmental because its a position i put myself in

7032569 elmer we must go tonight so we can get as far away as we can before ma wakes up and sees that we are gone
7032570 ive also consistently said that i will consult with military commanders on the ground and that we will always be open to the possibility of tactical adjustments the important thing is to send a clear signal to the iraqi people and most importantly to the iraqi leadership that the u s occupation in iraq is finite it is gonna be coming to a foreseeable end
7032571 what weight will you give to the counsel of the chairman of the joint chiefs the centcom u s central command commander the combatant commander on the ground in iraq and current intelligence chiefs on the ground in iraq regarding an immediate phased withdrawal
7032572 i will give their counsel great weight but as commander in chief it is my responsibility to make my own assessment of the situation we must send a clear signal to the iraqi political leadership that we are leaving iraq on a timeline doing so will put pressure on those leaders to begin to resolve the political impasse at the heart of this civil war but i also want to be clear about another thing i am worried our army is overstretched and that we have asked an awful lot from our military families many in our senior military leadership are worried about a plan that will keep 130 000 troops on the ground in iraq for the foreseeable future so as commander in chief i will also have to take into consideration the counsel of other senior military leaders who may be concerned that iraq is undercutting our ability to confront other security challenges
7032573 the precise size of the residual force will depend on consultations with our military commanders and will depend on the circumstances on the ground including the willingness of the iraqi government to move toward political accommodation but let me be clear on one thing i will end this war and there will be far fewer americans in iraq conducting a much more limited set of missions that include counterterrorism and protection of our embassy and u s civilians
7032574 if we see a serious effort by the iraqi leadership to arrive at an agreement and an accommodation and youve seen continued reductions of violence then you need one level of troop protection for the embassy if things have gone to hell in a hand basket then you need another its not my job to specify troop levels my job is to tell our commanders on the ground heres your mission protect our embassy protect our diplomats and our humanitarian workers in the area and make sure al qaeda in iraq or other terrorist organizations inside of iraq are not re establishing bases there
7032575 according to all the reports we should have been well along our way in getting the iraqi security forces to be more functional we then have another 16 months after that to adjust the withdrawal and make sure that we are withdrawing from those areas based on advice from the military officers in the field those places where we are secured made progress and were not just willy nilly removing troops but were making a determination in this region we see some stability weve had cooperation from local tribal leaders and local officials so we can afford to remove troops here here weve still got problems its going to take a little bit longer maybe those are the last areas to pull out
7032576 if the commanders tell me they need x y and z in order to accomplish the very narrow mission that ive laid out than i will take that into consideration
7032577 you raise a series of legitimate questions as commander in chief im not going to leave trainers unprotected in our counterterrorism efforts im not going to have a situation where our efforts cant be successful we will structure those forces so they can be successful we would still have human intelligence capabilities on the ground some of them would be civilian as opposed to military some would be operating out of our bases as well as our signal intelligence but listen i am not going to set up our troops for failure and im going to do something half baked if the commanders tell me that they need x y and z in order to accomplish the very narrow mission that ive laid out than i will take that into consideration
7032578 even something as simple as protecting our embassy is going to dependent on what is the security in baghdad if there is some sense of security then that means one level of force if you continue to have significant sectarian conflict that means another
7032579 i have not ascribed particular numbers to that and i wont for precisely the reason i was just talking to michael about i want to talk to military folks on the ground no 1 no 2 a lot of it depends on whats happened on the political front and the diplomatic front even something as simple as protecting our embassy is going to be dependent on what is the security environment in baghdad if there is some sense of security then that means one level of force if you continue to have significant sectarian conflict that means another but this is an area where senator clinton and i do have a significant contrast
7032580 that we should have all our troops out by 2013 but i dont want to make promises
7032581 i think its hard to project four years from now and i think it would be irresponsible we dont know what contingency will be out there what i can promise is that if there are still troops in iraq when i take office which it appears there may be unless we can get of our republican colleagues to change their mind and cut off funding without a timetable if theres no timetable then i will drastically reduce our presence there to the mission of protecting our embassy protecting our civilians and making sure that were carrying out counterterrorism activities there i believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013 but i dont want to make promises not knowing what the situations going to be three or four years out
7032582 th e theological colossus that guards the entrance to old
7032583 open your bible to deuteronomy and follow me while i read
7032584 moses proclaimed to the israelites all the lord had commanded him concerning them th e lord our god said to us at horeb th en as the lord our god commanded us when the lord heard what you said he was angry and solemnly swore because of you the lord became angry with me also and said but the lord said to me
7032585 you see chris thats only the first chapter of deuteronomy and
7032586 contemplate the very term word th e acts of creation themselves
7032587 in your soul you have sensed what the words really are and are really about youre afraid to see god youre afraid to know him th ats why youre stuck in your journey you arent the fi rst but you have this few who read these words have any understanding of the awesome presence in which they stand you have felt the fi re and seen the cloud dont turn back press on
7032588 moses spoke to all israel in the desert east of the jordan that is in the arabah opposite suph between paran and tophel laban hazeroth and dizahab
7032589 moses proclaimed to the israelites all that the lord had commanded him concerning them
7032590 th e technical term for what youve found chris is a chiasm its a concentric structure of music or text that can operate on any level from the few verses you are studying to the book of deuteronomy or the bible as a whole you can see the logic of it in an english translation th e poetry and music only come through fully in the hebrew th e liturgical churches understand intuitively at least something of this more than my own evangelical tradition truth and goodness are communicated through beauty th e music and poetry of it awaken our sensitivity to meaning th e holy spirit is not a hack writer i think youre ready to go on
7032591 why does god insert verse two in here hal th e reference to the eleven days it takes to go from horeb to kadesh barnea seems out of place
7032592 is to contrast the ease of gods way with the difficulty of mans horeb is sinai where the law was given kadesh barnea was the place they were supposed to jump off for the promised land you are about to read that part of the story but the bottom line is that because of their lack of faith it took the israelites thirty eight years to make a trip they could have made in eleven days if they had followed the lords command his yoke is easy and his burden is light keep reading
7032593 you have stayed long enough at this mountain break camp and advance into the hill country of the amorites go to all the neighboring peoples in the arabah in the mountains in the western foothills in the negev and along the coast to the land of the canaanites and to lebanon as far as the great river the euphrates see i have given you this land go in and take possession of the land that the lord swore he would give to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob and to their descendants after them
7032594 how did you feel about education when you graduated from law school
7032595 and what does that have to do with the next three verses you are studying in deuteronomy
7032596 to bring his flock away from the mountain and lead them into acting on the promise i hear it in moses throughout deuteronomy and in paul when he says of himself when i became a man i put childish ways behind me and in the writer of hebrews when he scolds his readers for still living on milk like infants and not being ready for the solid food of maturity most people in the pew spend their life at the foot of the mountain being hearers of the word but not doers i used to plead with god to give me one congregation or one board of elders that could leave the mountain before my ministry was over but he never did th ere were some very deep and committed believers i knew over the years some who moved on spiritually to deeper levels and some who took possession of the promises god had laid out before them but if success in ministry means leading people beyond the elementary level ive been one of gods colossal failures as a servant
7032597 youre not ready to talk about what you think you know
7032598 th e subject of government will come up in the text again and well talk about it then just read the rest of chapter one verses nineteen through forty six and the fi rst verse of chapter two
7032599 you have reached the hill country of the amorites which the lord our god is giving us see the lord your god has given you the land go up and take possession of it as the lord the god of your fathers told you do not be afraid do not be discouraged
7032600 let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to
7032601 it is a good land that the lord our god is giving us
7032602 th e lord hates us so he brought us out of
7032603 do not be terrifi ed do not be afraid of them th e lord your god who is going before you will fi ght for you as he did for you in egypt before your very eyes and in the desert th ere you saw how the lord your god carried you as a father carries his son all the way you went until you reached this place
7032604 not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land i swore to give your forefathers except caleb son of jephunneh he will see it and i will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on because he followed the lord wholeheartedly
7032605 you shall not enter it either but your assistant joshua son of nun will enter it encourage him because he will lead israel to inherit it and the little ones that you said would be taken captive your children who do not yet know good from bad they will enter the land i will give it to them and they will take possession of it but as for you turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the red sea
7032606 we have sinned against the lord we will go up and fight as the lord our god commanded us
7032607 i thought we should discuss this section somewhere that we could get a sense of journeys
7032608 watch the people going by th ink about what the journey is for each one where theyve been where theyre going now tomorrow next week
7032609 are not just travel in space th e journey of israel in this passage is a journey in space and in time like these people around us but more importantly it is the journey of the spiritual experience of the people it covers most of the wanderings before the entry into the land a period of thirty eight years and the experience of a failure of faith th ey have been brought out of the bondage of egypt led through hardship to the edge of plenty and promised success by the creator of the universe yet they refuse to go in blaming their unbelief on gods evil motives toward them although god saved them by bringing them out of egypt they claim he intends to destroy them at the hands of amorites although god loved them and carried them as a father carries his son they claim that he hates them its the psychological phenomenon of projection where a person attributes to another the same feeling that he or she has toward that person
7032610 at every turn they do the opposite of what he asks every time he shows them why they should have faith in him they are unfaithful th en the consequences of their unbelief are brought to them he sends them back toward the desert and tells them they will not see the good land only their children will th is is in eff ect a death sentence to wander in that vast and dreadful desert for the rest of their lives faced with the consequence of their sin they repent and try to make it up by doing what theyre no longer commanded to do a further rebellion and the result is utter failure at every point they act contrary to god and the result is that the blessings are withheld and given to a generation that will accept them
7032611 is written with you the people to whom it is addressed in both the singular and plural th e shift from addressing the individual to the group you occurs throughout the book often within discrete passages since both are translated simply you in english you dont see the difference in english bibles in biblical studies the technical term for this is the numeruswechsel both singular and plural you appear in this passage you dont need to remember the technical term but whats important is that the message is addressed to both the nation and to individuals
7032612 for you chris that means it is addressed to you personally and to every other individual human being but the heir to the israel of moses is not the modern state of israel nor the united states nor any other contemporary nation it is the church in the words of the apostles creed the holy catholic church the church universal the community of believers or at least those who associate together and profess to be believers
7032613 th is sounds like a literal understanding simple enough th e bible tells a story the facts are true and there are lessons to be gained are there other ways of understanding it
7032614 beyond the literal historical sense and the moral or example we can take from that are the allegorical typological and anagogical senses of scripture th ese are not the same but people use the terms somewhat interchangeably and everyone doesnt always mean the same thing when they use them th ey must be used with care
7032615 whole stories or sections of scripture are sometimes seen as symbolic or fi gurative of something else ways of expressing truths about god and humanity stories that dont fi t well with our current human understanding such as the early chapters of genesis or the books of job or jonah are often seen as allegorical a great danger in allegory is that it can lead to fl ights of fancy where the true meaning of the scripture is lost in human imagining and we hear man and not god another danger is that allegorical interpretations become focused on words or worse numbers and fi nd hidden meanings in the text that are supposedly known only to some inner circle th is is the stuff that leads to cults
7032616 th e story of israel is the story of humanity
7032617 god does great things for them and they turn away from him afraid to follow his commands blaming him for their fears in the end they deserve only wilderness wanderings and death
7032618 particular historical events are seen as prefiguring or symbolizing something that comes to full significance in christ th e crossing of the red sea prefigures baptism jonah prefigures the resurrection of christ typology is usually grounded in the scriptures themselves which often make these connections explicit jesus taught that the law of moses as well as the prophets and the psalmists all wrote of him so we are not off base in seeing these connections moses is a type of christ in many respects
7032619 in anagogical interpretation one finds beyond the literal moral allegorical or typological a spiritual and even mystical sense in which the scripture has eternal significance in leading believers to the true homeland th e anagogical sense of scripture is better felt than taught its what comes from the depth of contemplating god in prayer and meditation in light of the scriptures when you understand scripture in an anagogical sense you will have gotten beyond the milk of elementary teachings and will be eating real spiritual meat

7032655 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy

7032663 we have observed these abuses the festival will be used to correct these abuses observed in the way our female members dress some songs that our choirs sing and in the celebration mass some bishops have frowned at these things and have decided that we should find a way of addressing the issues
7032664 let not the gospel on being introduced into any new land destroy or extinguish whatever its people possess that is naturally good just or beautiful for the church when she calls a person to higher culture and better way of life under the inspiration of the christian religion does not act like one who recklessly cuts down and uproots a thriving forest
7032665 this is another opportunity for us as joint stakeholders in nation building to collaborate and ensure the success of the festival in question
7032666 it will not only bring out cultural features and arts that can be of liturgical benefit to the catholic church but also showcase the moral values of our culture and people to the world

7032679 when i left williamsburg in june i decided i would begin sharing all the information god has revealed to me i have found that i have an amazing knack for understanding what the pastor and deacons and committee heads do not only that but i also have been given the gift of discerning any prideful and selfish motives behind their actions

7032689 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7032690 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7032691 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7032692 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7032693 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7032694 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7032711 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
7032712 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
7032713 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies

7032724 drivers across the country can fight rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation tires that are underinflated by just six to seven psi can reduce vehicle fuel economy by as much as 2 percent and tire tread wear can also be reduced by as much as ten percent
7032725 tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas are wasted annually by u s drivers simply because theyre driving on underinflated tires
7032726 in addition that same 2 8 billion gallons wasted result into 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide released into the environment
7032727 we can all help prevent this by making sure our tires are properly inflated
7032728 people can find the tires proper inflation level on the vehicle placard located in the driver side door jamb in the glove box or in the owners manual

7032730 he is irreplaceable said charles mwape a member of mwanawasas ruling movement for multiparty democracy mmd
7032731 we have lost a great leader and it will be difficult to fill the gap mr mwape said
7032732 its like tying a letter to a helium balloon and letting it fly
7032733 you know it will never reach the intended destination but it takes a load off your shoulders
7032734 probably 90 percent of the games were good games and close and down to the wire and the crowds were into it
7032735 i think its a real shame theyre not going to have baseball in the 2012 olympics and i think it needs to come back its a summer sport and its one of the main sports in the world during the summer
7032736 weve had good crowds the whole time people have been into it
7032737 i really do believe its going to be back in 2016 especially if its in chicago or tokyo baseball is too important to both america and japan to have it not be in there
7032738 but well get to carry the bronze until in about eight years they can hopefully bring it back
7032739 and unless they find a way to have a couple week break i dont see them letting their best players leave you might take two or three players from a club and you might lose the pennant because of the timing
7032740 we have a lot of guys on our club that have been in the major leagues
7032741 and guys that are going to be in the big leagues eventually i really think its a shame that was said that big leaguers have to be on the team for baseball to come back
7032742 but we didnt bring it back i feel sorry about this we have never experienced such a tough time before
7032743 i experienced a lot through the game but it doesnt mean much if we dont have victory
7032744 i think we as a team feel pretty good about what weve accomplished
7032745 the teams that are going to be playing for gold and silver are obviously very good clubs overall were pretty happy to going to be going home with something

7032749 whether i stay in charge is up to the bosses of british cycling theyve got to step up and think what they want to do ive got a family to feed a living to make and i want to win things im not paid that much to be honest and if someone came along and asked me to do something else for a lot of money who knows
7032750 like a pop group the sum of its parts are greater than the individuals when i get asked to and work in other places for other people id be a fool to think i could just walk off on my own ive got a brilliant team of people we blend well together itd be a dangerous thing to think i can go and do this somewhere else now
7032751 i keep getting asked by the staff when are we going to get together have a meeting im refusing to set a date because if you do that you set a date for making a decision i think we need to step away from this reintegrate ourselves into normal cycling lives and let the dust settle
7032752 were smart enough to have learned any lessons performance wise we wont miss anything but i dont want to rush into anything ill speak with every individual see where they see their futures what they want to do i dont want to be rushed into producing a master plan for the next four years
7032753 why not people said it was impossible to finish third here go back six months and think about people saying you cant finish better than fourth in the medal table which was plausible if you looked at the stats you couldnt finish third because you couldnt dislodge russia
7032754 but thats the simplicity of what we are trying to do conventional wisdom would have dictated we couldnt finish third but it is possible so rather than saying weve set ourselves up to fail in london this could be the best step forward

7032776 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7032777 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7032778 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
7032779 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
7032780 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry
7032781 congress created a program for direct loans and were hopeful that they can fund those this year
7032782 after the death of his father knutr attempted to retain the sceptre of the kingdom but he was quite unequal to so doing for the number of his followers was insufficient the king ordered a fleet to be got ready for him not because he was fleeing afraid of the harsh outcome of war but in order to consult his brother haraldr the king of the danes about so weighty a matter
7032783 thorkell whom we have already mentioned as a military commander observed that the land was most excellent and chose to take up his residence in so fertile a country and make peace with the natives rather than to return home like one who had in the end been expelled
7032784 he became a friend and intimate of churchmen to such a degree that he seemed to bishops to be a brother bishop for his maintenance of perfect religion to monks also not a secular but a monk for the temperance of his life of most humble devotion

7032837 network marketing companies mlm leads compensation model is a brilliant way to subsidize or even replace anyones income with mlm leads the network marketing companies mlm leads challenge is the need for a true multi media and traditional mlm leads marketing approach combined with internet technology this is not going to happen until network marketing companies realize that distributor training and retention have to be functions of the entire mlm leads generation and internet marketing system
7032838 this entire focus of tantalizing people on the internet with a book of mlm leads magic tricks shows the short sightedness of internet companies that there is a singular technology that can provide a magic network marketing mlm leads miracle for building upline and downline distributor bases the truth is that in order to secure true success you have to take the old paradigm circles out of the formula and that the real wealth creator in the mlm lead world is combining numerous vertical marketing strategies into a comprehensive leads generation marketing system leads technology is only as good as the marketing system with which you surround it and the quality of the mlm leads

7032848 national conventions are almost always held in uncomfortable and filthy places
7032849 food is bad and expensive and everyone goes home exhausted and sore
7032850 there is something about a national convention that makes it as fascinating as a revival or a hanging
7032851 it is vulgar it is ugly it is stupid it is tedious it is hard upon both the higher cerebral centers and the gluteus maximus and yet it is somehow charming one sits through long sessions wishing all the delegates and alternates were dead and in hell and then suddenly there comes a show so gaudy and hilarious so melodramatic and obscene so unimaginably exhilarating and preposterous that one lives a gorgeous year in an hour

7032886 ik weet niet of je het weet maar ik heb de politie aan de lijn dus doe geen dingen waar je later spijt van krijgt je zit nu al in de problemen maak het nu niet nog erger
7032887 ik wil mij graag als groep distanti ren van discriminatie

7032889 hij heeft ze in een kist gestopt en geknepen en ik had zoiets van nou dat kan niet dus ik ga de politie bellen
7032890 waar ben je het meest triest om als ik vragen mag
7032891 het meest triest ben ik omdat ik de hele dag op basis van mijn seksuele geaardheid de grond in wordt getrapt ik vind het ook vreemd dat ze zelf niet realiseert dat ze niet alleen mij er mee kwetst maar ook nog een hoop anderen
7032892 ik weet nog dat brian vroeg hebben jullie seks met elkaar gehad ik bevestigde dat en naar mijn weten zei hij iets van jij en eric wat vies maar dat is wat ik me ongeveer kan herinneren
7032893 ik wil graag aangifte doen ik ben vandaag meerdere malen gediscrimineerd om mijn geaardheid er zijn een aantal dingen gebeurd en daar wil ik graag aangifte van doen

7032903 ik zit me verschrikkelijk te ergeren aan de uitspraken van brian de antiliaan in de gouden kooi hij doet zulke lelijke discrimerende uitspraken tegen eric talpa tien doet er zo te zien niets aan maar ik en velen met mij kunnen dit niet tolereren die antiliaan schijnt zich alles te kunnen veroorloven in de gouden kooi hij heeft al zoveel dingen gedaan en krijgt nooit een sanctie opgelegd en zoals hij onlangs eric uitgescholden heeft dat gaat gewoon alle perken te buiten
7032904 als forumlid van de gouden kooi erger ik me aan de discriminerende uitlatingen van bewoner brain helaas doet de redactie van het programma er niets aan jammer is dat

7032918 the poisonous and inebriating effects produced in those who drink the liqueur of absinth is undoubtedly due more to the plant than to the alcohol
7032919 the coloring matters used in absinthe are often very deleterious in fact not infrequently copper salts have been used in order to produce the green color
7032920 it is not me who did this please tell me oh god that i have not done this
7032921 absinthe is the principal cause of a series of bloody crimes in our country
7032922 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that

7033119 aventura y yo llevamos un tiempo hablando sobre la idea de poder hacer algo en nuestros discos escribir juntos lo de la gira surgi hace como ocho meses que est bamos romeo y yo hablando por tel fono y lo comentamos y pensamos que podr a ser una buena idea algo distinto para el p blico hispano de los estados unidos que puedan ir a un concierto que sea inolvidable m gico que la gente pueda ver dos tipos de m sica y disfrutarlo como nunca han disfrutado un concierto
7033120 no es que la baile pero la bachata me encanta me gusta siempre me ha gustado much simo desde que era un chaval desde que escuchaba a juan luis guerra es uno de mis compositores favoritos

7033122 me encantar a hacer un disco en el futuro pero definitivamente quisiera incursionar en el cine

7033170 yo viene aqu para ganar t tulos y esta temporada tenemos todo aqu para lograrlos ste ha sido otro aspecto importante para quedarme

7033191 we have been able to speak to the boat everyones fine the seas are a bit rough and the primary navigational systems are still not working but we have back up
7033192 we are following developments and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid this
7033193 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
7033194 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
7033195 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
7033196 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
7033197 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
7033198 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
7033199 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
7033200 i was impressed by them when they beat us last season
7033201 they are a young confident bunch and im not really surprised that they have came up and started winning because they are used to winning last season in the first division
7033202 so we know its going to be a tough game but we are going to treat it like any other game in the spl
7033203 but we know what we can do and we are quietly confident
7033204 we beat them in the cis cup last season and we won that game quite convincingly
7033205 jim jefferies and the team will be looking to make amends for that so its important we play as well we we can
7033206 no doubt jim will have mentioned the cup defeat to his players and it will be another difficult game as they have started the season well
7033207 it should be a fascinating game but we hope to maintain our unbeaten record with another win at kilmarnock
7033208 one of the things i said when i signed for the club was that one of my ambitions was to get players in the scotland squad the fact we are achieving that is brilliant
7033209 i think we cope very well with defeat we did last year and we will this year
7033210 we know we are going to lose games this season as we did last season and still can finish third
7033211 id like to think there are goals in this game and im sure mark would say the same
7033212 both of us have lost a striker over the summer but weve made moves to replace them
7033213 last season there wasnt too much between the sides it was a good fight right to the end for third place and both of us will be hoping its the same again this season
7033214 motherwell havent got off to the start they would have wanted and neither did we so it has been kind of the same for both of us
7033215 i was pleased with the way we played against celtic last weekend and want more of the same while i think motherwell have been unlucky so far

7033219 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7033220 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president
7033221 mr obamas choice of mr biden suggested some of the weaknesses the obama campaign is trying to address at a time when national polls suggest that his race with senator john mccain the presumptive republican nominee is tightening
7033222 the obama campaign exudes quiet confidence that if they do the basic political work between now and november 4 the illinois senator will be president do they really want to risk it with biden
7033223 apart from his national stature biden has demonstrated his personal charm and ability to connect one on one with delaware voters by winning six senate races

7033239 en aquel momento solo sent que hab a hecho realidad una idea del comandante cumpl a una misi n y nada m s como hacemos todos los cubanos
7033240 solo durante la realizaci n del primer congreso mundial de alfabetizaci n un encuentro de los educadores que trabajamos en bien de la humanidad comenc a comprender la real magnitud pol tica de la tarea la idea verdadera de fidel que no es solo alfabetizar sino vindicar a los excluidos de la tierra lograr un movimiento social que los una como seres humanos transformar el mundo en ese congreso casi me sorprendo aunque nunca averiguo cu ntos alfabetizados ya hay por el m todo yo s puedo ni por cu ntos pa ses anda no pregunto para evitar el susto
7033241 soy la misma mujer sencilla de siempre que hace cola atiende su casa sigo igual aunque internamente me siento ahora m s humana que antes lo alcanzado hasta aqu me ha permitido trazarme un objetivo en la vida seguir contribuyendo desde cualquier trinchera a eliminar el analfabetismo esa es la injusticia social m s grande que he visto en la vida porque cada analfabeto est asociado al hambre a la miseria al desempleo a condiciones infrahumanas y cuando t le das una cartilla y un l piz esa persona te besa y te abraza como si le hubieras dado lo m s grande del mundo entonces como es tanto el amor que he recibido creo que tengo que seguir pagando as con amor
7033242 con su mano sobre mi hombro y t sabes cu nto pesa esa mano es algo muy grande ya sinti ndome por dentro el compromiso que aquello significaba me dio varias sugerencias pensando en el uso de la televisi n para alfabetizar hacer una cartilla de cuatro o cinco p ginas y para elaborarla combinar los n meros con las letras y empezar por la palabra casa
7033243 aun sin partir de ning n supuesto pedag gico o cient fico l sab a que las personas iletradas conoc an los n meros y ese fue el argumento la palabra casa deb a ser la primera explic porque se pod a traducir f cilmente a otros idiomas y porque de alguna forma tambi n el analfabeto conoce lo que es si no la tiene sabe cu n necesaria resulta y si la tiene lucha much simo por mantenerla
7033244 porque imag nate t combinar los n meros con las letras es realmente algo dif cil ya hab amos hecho una cartilla muy amplia para la radio y aunque l no lo expres cuando conversamos sent que no le satisfac a porque era demasiado amplia al sugerirme una de pocas p ginas yo estaba percibiendo una cr tica muy sutil muy delicada pero una cr tica
7033245 organic entonces los n meros de acuerdo con la frecuencia de uso de cada una de esas consonantes y a las vocales en el mismo orden que se conocen les otorgu del uno al cinco
7033246 hubiera sido f cil adoptar el m todo para ense ar la lectoescritura en la primaria donde tambi n hay un orden para el aprendizaje
7033247 despu s de numerar del uno al cinco a las vocales la primera consonante que aprender an asociada al n mero seis decid que ser a la l de trazo f cil para aquellos que nunca han tomado un l piz y entre sus manos torpes de tanto trabajo rudo les parece un instrumento demasiado fr gil y a la vez impresionante
7033248 este m todo persigue ser amigable optimista crear un estado emocional favorable para elevar la autoestima y garantizar as un aprendizaje r pido eficaz a partir de los conocimientos de los propios participantes
7033249 en venezuela espec ficamente les llamamos patriotas participantes porque hay que ser un verdadero patriota para incorporarse a los 102 a os a un proceso de alfabetizaci n o a los 80 a los 70 cuando todo el mundo te ha dicho que no se puede

7033277 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7033278 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7033279 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7033280 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7033281 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7033282 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7033283 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7033284 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7033285 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7033286 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7033287 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7033288 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7033289 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7033290 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7033291 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7033292 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7033293 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7033294 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7033295 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7033296 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro
7033297 im in this race to stay im in this race to win
7033298 in the end biden may be remembered as the candidate who truly offered the voters an echo and not a choice
7033299 im going back to gary hart at least he didnt steal that girl from some far lefty in england
7033300 so my advice to candidates like joe biden is this do justly love perorations and walk humbly with thy speechwriter
7033301 times have changed you cant get away with borrowing anything these days not even an oratorical technique much less a phrase or paragraph unless you are willing to give the attribution
7033302 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7033303 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7033304 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7033305 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7033306 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7033307 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7033308 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7033309 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7033310 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7033311 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7033312 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7033313 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7033314 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7033315 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7033316 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7033317 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7033318 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7033319 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7033320 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7033321 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7033322 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7033323 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7033324 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7033325 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7033326 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7033327 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7033328 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7033329 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7033330 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7033331 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7033332 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7033333 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7033334 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7033335 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7033336 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7033337 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7033338 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7033339 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7033340 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7033341 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7033342 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7033343 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7033344 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7033345 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7033346 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7033347 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7033348 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7033349 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7033350 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7033351 who are open to doing something on the production side
7033352 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7033353 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7033354 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7033355 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7033356 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7033357 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7033358 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7033359 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7033360 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7033361 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

7033368 everybody in the world knew it was happening but i wasnt part of the discussion of making it happen
7033369 it looked to me as if this is in conformity with legislation but i dont claim to be an expert on it
7033370 we had enough to pay for the campaign but we didnt have money that we thought we could start transferring it to the ridings on that scale because we were just coming off the leadership race and the party had newly been merged and things were tighter by the time we got to 2006 there was extra money so we thought we could help the ridings this time
7033371 i have no idea what mr harper did or did not know
7033372 wow they actually thought that this story could be killed off by meeting with a few reporters on a sunday afternoon i mean theres audacity of hope and then theres just crazy talk
7033373 off the record the journalists from the two networks involved explain that everything was decided by the elys e and that the proposals submitted by tf1 and france 2 corresponded precisely to the booklet of presidential demands an allusion to the rumours that nicolas sarkozy was disappointed after the broadcast of last nov 29 his most recent such exercise according to several press accounts nicolas sarkozy was critical of a broadcast that was too dated too soft too similar to what we saw under chirac those concerned have acted accordingly
7033374 i didnt have a very well formed idea at all
7033375 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

7033380 i was very excited when i got my initial results
7033381 en dan word je in het internationale tophockey keihard afgerekend we maakten domme fouten en hadden te weinig discipline om deze wedstrijd gewoon goed te spelen
7033382 daar heb ik niets aan toe te voegen op belangrijke momenten gaven we vandaag niet thuis en dat was kenmerkend voor het hele toernooi
7033383 ik had me zeer veel voorgesteld van dit toernooi maar dat heeft het niet gebracht dit was dramatisch
7033384 ik heb die wedstrijd tegen pakistan er bewust nog bijgehaald maar nu gebeurt het wederom maar ik denk niet dat dit keer de instelling ontbrak ik vraag me wel af hoe het zat met het bewustzijn of ze wel nadachten op wat voor manier we tegen australi moesten spelen ik heb me op bepaalde momenten behoorlijk ge rgerd
7033385 de teleurstelling na zon afdroogpartij leidt tot hevige reacties maar dat is wat mij betreft niet noodzakelijk je wint maar verliest ook met zn allen
7033386 its like trying to nail green jell o to the wall
7033387 here this woman had come to the door with her tin cup saying i thirst
7033388 and we had said we can take care of that and we dragged out the fire hose and drowned her in living waters
7033389 most people who hear that attack dont think that it just means that mormons do not believe in the nicene creed or that they accept the book of mormon as scripture in addition to the bible
7033390 as a result of that alone brothers and sisters and i pay tribute to you the saints are far more scripturally literate than they have ever been before
7033391 that is the only two scriptural passages i know of that describe how jesus was conceived i am not aware of any official declaration or official proclamation i am not aware of any general conference address by the brethren today or for the last 50 years that goes beyond that any effort therefore to explain how jesus was conceived beyond luke and alma 7 is speculative
7033392 you told us that we believe in the virgin birth
7033393 no no you said we believe in the virgin birth of jesus and you know we dont
7033394 no from the time i was this high i was taught that god had sexual relations with mary and that is how jesus was conceived
7033395 i am fully aware that that was taught by some people im even aware of when the talk that mentioned it was delivered and by whom there are people who taught it but it is not the doctrine of the church the doctrine of the church is what is contained in alma 7 and what is contained in luke we dont know how that took place and to go beyond that is to speculate
7033396 elder mcconkie what should we explain to our students about whether jesus was married
7033397 well i dont know the scriptures are silent on that
7033398 where we get ourselves into difficulty in many cases with other people misunderstanding us is we go beyond what weve been told and what weve been taught in authoritative sources
7033399 anybody can dredge up dig up something that was said by somebody in the past the question though rather is what is being taught today this is a living church and if you believe it is a living church then we pay close attention to the living prophets and we answer the questions like they answer them

7033435 relations between iran and russia can best be described as a marriage of convenience
7033436 iranian leaders are aware of it the dependency and they resent it but there was very little they could do about it
7033437 following current developments in the caucasus and urge s the belligerent parties to resolve their disputes through peaceful means
7033438 our reticence only aids the camp that wishes us regional adversaries to remain silent while us supporters come to the support of georgian president mikheil saakashvili
7033439 a whole new set of options may be opening up for iran
7033440 this war in georgia was an early sign of escalating russian assertiveness
7033441 irans rather neutral stance on the caucasus can be read as a signal to the united states
7033442 if the united states was to open an interest section in iran perhaps neighboring countries such as turkmenistan would see this as the start of a thaw in us iranian relations the real opening they are waiting for in order to boost their trade or oil and gas shipments via iran

7033453 much worse than we would have imagined as recently as six months ago
7033454 the creeping nationalization of energy assets and the fact that much of the low hanging fruit has been picked
7033455 the deteriorating investment climate in the russian energy sector has clearly deterred foreign investment and it goes without saying that fighting wars with neighbors is not going to make the kremlin look warm and fuzzy
7033456 the russians are highly dependent on old oil fields with rising water cuts
7033457 with russian oil production now heading south it will be extremely difficult for non opec oil supply to post any meaningful growth in the future
7033458 the world now has a precariously balanced oil market that cannot withstand any meaningful oil supply disruptions without significantly higher oil price implications
7033459 additionally increasing demand from caspian countries for a bigger piece of the oil profits may continue to delay and push back some of the larger projects scheduled to come online over the next five years
7033460 we believe that over the next three to five years the world will see no meaningful or sustainable net increase in non opec oil production

7033483 lucy had sadly gone to the great doggie playland where there are no end of treats lots of faces to kiss and arthritic joints dont hurt anymore
7033484 mid to late every afternoon they would head along main street sometimes stopping for a sit on the bench in front of u hall visit the grocery store stroll back along acadia street or via the path by the tracks sometimes stopping for another sit and a rest on the grass mornings and evenings they could be seen heading for the wolfville quiet park for me and also for many of my students and friends lois and lucy have been a treasured part of the wolfville community they will be missed
7033485 i have been simply blown away by the response to my message to the acadia community re lois and lucy yesterday i had over 70 e mails phone calls and visits at my office all were people thanking me for filling in the gap many had been missing the duo and almost all had some little lois lucy story to share people from every sector on campus newcomers and lifers as well
7033486 so many times i have commented what a wonderful sight it was to see them together sometimes she would have her bright red hat on and bright red lipstick i would say to myself i must take a photo because this will not always be so of course i never did take the photo but i sure hope that somebody did another thing i say to myself is its the little things in life that make the difference and the old lady and her dog was certainly one of them so many times it gladdened my heart
7033487 i did want to know i love that we are in a place where we know people and we know that others do and that it matters may we all be so fortunate to have spots to rest people who notice our presence and absence and people who know that others will want to know what happens to us and our dogs we are fortunate to be part of a community and i think particularly of the university community where such things are far and away the most important things
7033488 i too noticed this sweet lady walking her dog as i drove into wolfville daily all too often these people seem to disappear without us ever putting a name to their faces thank you for sharing her story and thanks to lois for making me smile every time i saw her and lucy enjoying the simpler pleasures in life
7033489 it reminds me of why i am so grateful that i accepted the appointment to acadia university and that my family and i moved to wolfville
7033490 during my darkest times and grief i would see them out for their daily walk somehow this gave me peace a feeling that there was a constant in my life amid the whirling chaos of change even in the moments when i felt the most alone seeing this constant revealed a momentary truth for me a realization that we are never really alone and invisible we are in fact connected to one and other strung together by moments in time often without recognizing it
7033491 the 2007 survey shows an unprecedented rise in activity in traditional foreign exchange markets compared to 2004 average daily turnover rose to 3 2 trillion in april 2007 an increase of 71 at current exchange rates and 65 at constant exchange rates against the background of low levels of financial market volatility and risk aversion market participants point to a significant expansion in the activity of investor groups including which was partly facilitated by substantial growth in the use of prime brokerage and retail investors a marked increase in the levels of most notably algorithmic trading is also likely to have boosted turnover in the spot market transactions between reporting dealers and non reporting financial institutions such as mutual funds pension funds and insurance companies more than doubled between april 2004 and april 2007 and contributed more than half of the increase in aggregate turnover

7033508 when they fled the scene they went into one residence and the victim went to get help

7033577 we feel honestly the pull of many obligations and try to fulfill them all and we are unhappy uneasy strained oppressed and fearful we shall be shallow
7033578 we have hints that there is a way of life vastly richer and deeper than all this hurried existence a life of unhurried serenity and peace and power if only we could slip over into that center
7033579 we have seen and known some people who seem to have found this deep center of living where the fretful calls of life are integrated where no as well as yes can be said with confidence
7033580 there will be no business as usual in denver during the dnc

7033582 i think youre going to see one of the larger protests at a democratic convention
7033583 history says at conventions and things like this you do have people who are disruptive we hope it doesnt happen but you have to be prepared
7033584 be on the lookout for stockpiles and caches of supplies that could be used by violent demonstrators

7033586 the city said from the beginning that they wanted to strike a balance between first amendment rights and security

7033594 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
7033595 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake
7033596 i try to keep that as independent from my work as possible
7033597 a purely circumstantial speculative argument but while its speculative its within the scientific bounds of reason
7033598 certainly there are high expectations from the public from the new government we will fulfill their aspirations by working in objective and planned manner for which we have outlined a number of national priority issues
7033599 first and foremost is the protection of national sovereignty independence and territorial integrity if nepal does not exist then there is no meaning for anything else including the republic but we have to strengthen the national unity based on full equality among people from himal pahad terai and madhes
7033600 i want to extend full commitment towards modern democratic principles like multi party competition period elections rule of law
7033601 our attention will be concentrated on addressing socio economic issues such as poverty unemployment and so on we will work to bring about modern industrial economy for which private public partnership model will be followed
7033602 the industrial peace will be maintained by improving relations between labor and employers
7033603 taking the peace process to logical conclusion and writing constitution on time is the main task of this government
7033604 this government also has huge challenges we need the support and cooperation from army police administration international community and general public to meet the challenges
7033605 the us should have put their missile system in syria in the 1st place then russia wouldnt feel threatened
7033606 were fighting them there so we dont have to fight them here
7033607 russia is not backing down to anyone look they drove back into georgia so what will the united states do look we got anti missile system so we can take out your missiles dont underestimate russia they have the same system if not better they always do

7033613 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7033614 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7033615 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7033616 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7033617 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7033618 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7033619 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7033620 my view is that the buffer zones are against the spirit of the ceasefire agreement
7033621 why do they want to take control of poti they do not have such a right
7033622 maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here if they were our friends they would not do this
7033623 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7033624 the strike is part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir
7033625 it is also to demand our right to self determination through a referendum
7033626 the fighting that is still raging has so far left five militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7033627 any attempt of nato to fill the gap of losses of the georgian army contradicts the conventions of the osce organization of security and cooperation in europe
7033628 the cooling down of the relationship should not lead to complete freezing
7033629 i would like the megaphone to be left aside and we would proceed to calm and serious discussions of what is to be done to begin the immediate peace building in the region
7033630 the war against terrorism is our own war and it will continue until its logical end
7033631 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
7033632 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

7033641 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world

7033673 bagi mereka sekularisasi bukan penerapan sekularisme tetapi ia satu proses islami yang termeteri dalam kalimah syahadah
7033674 ini cukup mengelirukan sekurlarisme yang dipegang kuat oleh golongan ini selama lamanya tidak diterima dalam islam ianya sangat bahaya dan harus diwaspadainya
7033675 bagi mereka semua agama sama semua agama mengajar tentang kebaikan dan membawa kepada tuhan yang sama dengan cara yang berbeza
7033676 kita mengakui kewujudan pelbagai agama dalam negara tetapi tidak sampai mengakui kebenaran semua agama pemikiran ini menafikan kebenaran agama islam ia juga seharusnya bercanggah dengan fundamentalisme semua agama di malaysia seperti kristian hindu buddha dan sikh
7033677 kalau kepercayaan ini diterima sia sialah solat puasa zakat dan haji kerana amalan ini tidak wajib dalam agama lain dan kita boleh syurga ini satu bentuk penyelewangan yang mesti diawasi
7033678 ketahuilah sesungguhnya al quran semuanya sama baik di malaysia indonesia arab saudi iraq afrika china mahupun eropah tidak timbul ada dua tiga versi al quran yang berbeza sepanjang sejarah penulisan al quran
7033679 yang berbeza hanyalah qiraah bacaan dan rosam tulisan teksnya iaitu surah dan ayat tetap sama tidak berbeza
7033680 mushaf uthmani ialah yang terbaik walaupun yang lain tidak dibenarkan untuk sebaran am kita tidak perlu menafikan imla i baghdadi fatimi atau alifi
7033681 yang terdapat dalam dunia islam hari ini juga merupakan al quran ini dipersetujui secara ijmak oleh semua mazhab islam
7033682 kita perlu ingat cendiakawan kristian sendiri percaya terdapat percampuran antara kalam tuhan dengan kalam manusia semua cendiakawan kristian sepakat bahawa daripada 240 000 manuskrip bible tiada dua pun yang menyamai ini tidak berlaku kepada al quran
7033683 ya kita boleh ada tafsir dari pelbagai sudut tetapi tafsir dalam islam bukan untuk menguji nilai kebenaran al quran kerana al quran itu keseluruhannya ialah kalamullah
7033684 contohnya poligami mesti diharamkan ini menunjukkan secara terang mereka terlalu liberal hingga nas teks juga ingin diliberalkan
7033685 semuanya mesti dilibur hukum islam pantas ditidak apakan minum arak secara terbuka pergaulan bebas adalah juga bentuk penterjemahan islam yang kononnya moderat tetapi rupanya mudarat

7033723 the provision of infertility treatment has not been seen as a traditional nhs service and therefore is often viewed as a relatively low priority compared to more visible conditions whose impact is well established
7033724 the groups final report will seek to consider the often unseen consequences of infertility including the impact on mental health and general wellbeing which may draw on other nhs services for treatment as well as the positive benefits of ivf
7033725 lack of knowledge and understanding of infertility and its treatment
7033726 it is appropriate for ivf to be considered carefully for inclusion on the national tariff
7033727 clinicians and practitioners involved in infertility services are all aware that we are not just dealing with a physical pathology
7033728 infertility is a disease but it also has fallout beyond that for a significant proportion of couples causing mental health problems depression stress related illnesses and so on
7033729 it is a tremendous step forward that a region has seen the value of doing this and i would hope that others will do the same but there is certainly a view in the sector that central funding would solve an awful lot of problems

7033735 most infections by hpv are short lived and not associated with cervical cancer
7033736 the hpv dna test is not intended to substitute for regular pap screening nor is it intended to screen women under 30 who have normal pap tests although the rate of hpv infection in this group is high most infections are short lived and not associated with cervical cancer
7033737 most women who become infected with hpv are able to eradicate the virus and suffer no apparent long term consequences to their health
7033738 based on new scientific information published in the past 15 years it is now generally agreed that identifying and typing hpv infection does not bear a direct relationship to stratification of the risk for cervical cancer
7033739 pcr based hpv detection device with provision for accurate hpv genotyping is more urgently needed now because vaccination with gardasil of the women who are already sero positive and pcr positive for vaccine relevant genotypes of hpv has been found to increase the risk of developing high grade precancerous lesions by 44
7033740 concerns regarding primary endpoint analyses among subgroups there were two important concerns that were identified during the course of the efficacy review of this bla one was the potential for gardasil to enhance disease among a subgroup of subjects who had evidence of persistent infection with vaccine relevant hpv types at baseline the other concern was the observations of cin 2 3 or worse cases due to hpv types not contained in the vaccine these cases of disease due to other hpv types have the potential to counter the efficacy results of gardasil for the hpv types contained in the vaccine 1 evaluation of the potential of gardasil to enhance cervical disease in subjects who had evidence of persistent infection with vaccine relevant hpv types prior to vaccination the results of exploratory subgroup analyses for study 013 suggested a concern that subjects who were seropositive and pcr positive for the vaccine relevant hpv types had a greater number of cin 2 3 or worse cases as demonstrated in the following table observed efficacy 44 6 it appeared that subjects in this subgroup of study 013 who received gardasil might have had or worse compared to placebo recipients
7033741 finally there is compelling evidence that the vaccine lacks therapeutic efficacy among women who have had prior exposure to hpv and have not cleared previous infection pcr positive and seropositive
7033742 effect of human papillomavirus 16 18 l1 viruslike particle vaccine among young women with preexisting infection
7033743 no significant evidence of a vaccine therapeutic effect was observed in analyses restricted to women who received all doses of vaccine or those with evidence of single hpv infections at entry table2 we observed no evidence of vaccine effects when we stratified the analysis on selected study entry characteristics reflective of various parameters table3 similarly no evidence of vaccine effects was observed in analyses stratified by other study entry parameters thought to potentially influence clearance rates and efficacy of the vaccine including time since sexual initiation oral contraceptive use cigarette smoking and concomitant infection with c trachomatis or n gonorrhoeae table 3
7033744 rates of viral clearance over a 12 month period are not influenced by vaccination
7033745 given that viral clearance rates did not differ by treatment group and that persistent viral infection is the best established predictor of risk of progression it is unlikely that vaccination could have a significant beneficial impact on rate of lesion progression 1 17
7033746 most infections by hpv are short lived and not associated with cervical cancer
7033747 identifying and typing hpv infection does not bear a direct relationship to stratification of the risk for cervical cancer
7033748 a woman found to be positive for the same strain genotype of hpv on repeated testing is highly likely suffering from a persistent hpv infection and is considered to be at high risk of developing precancerous intraepithelial lesions in the cervix it is the persistent infection not the virus that determines the cancer risk

7033752 the message is one of despair disrespect and low expectations
7033753 it is also irresponsible and will raise promiscuity teenage pregnancy and worst of all infertility
7033754 no one will warn young women that they are not protected against chlamydia which is already affecting one in ten teenagers
7033755 personally i would like to see parents wait until the schools programme starts and all girls aged 12 and 13 can be offered protection re now girls aged nine are offered cervical cancer jab gardasil vaccine
7033756 she was walking through my house and collapsed she told me she couldnt feel her leg we went right to the hospital
7033757 the doctor recommended we get the gardasil shot and id been thinking about it because ive seen it on tv all the time
7033758 the reason im skeptical with this is this isnt a virus
7033759 the immediate risks are minimal the fda looked at those we have not seen any major catastrophes
7033760 even the worst case scenario if you have four thousand in four million that is a one to one thousand potential adverse effect
7033761 if you know something is happening why do you let it continue
7033762 i think there is a little cart before the horse going on here im not saying this is not a good vaccine but anyone who is going to have their daughter or child have this shot they need to be fully informed of risks or potential risks associated with it
7033763 the federal government would not put it on the list without medical scientific justification

7033851 the boats will never arrive the israelis will capture them before they get anywhere close to gaza
7033852 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place
7033853 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
7033854 trying to breach the wall of silence surrounding gaza is the best way to show that when is a problem is hidden it doesnt exist

7033857 theyre in the race now so weve got to re evaluate that for what it is
7033858 i was expecting a faster pace they didnt do it
7033859 and shes got an innate ability to read everything on the track
7033860 it would take a lot of luck for her to medal in the 5 000 and 10 000 where in the marathon it wont be luck shell be contending not just for a medal but for a win
7033861 i know i can do more every year ive added more and more i know there is more i can do i can sleep more i can eat a little better i can hit the weight room a little bit more
7033862 i hope that will give me an advantage both physically and mentally over the guys who are over trained and might have raced very hard marathons earlier in the year
7033863 ill always remember just how bad an experience that was
7033864 we could win the gold medal in every single track and field event but if we dont win a single thing in the sprints and relays the public will view our performance as a disaster when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
7033865 when these games are completed we will conduct a comprehensive review of all our programs
7033866 i think its great to get the silver and i won it in a fair way
7033867 but its not my place to judge her blonska i just wanted to get on the medal stand i didnt know where it would be im very happy with the silver
7033868 i just go out and give them a show i always enjoy myself after the races and people love us its a great thing
7033869 what i do i do for myself my coach and the fans im just showing my personality
7033870 you cannot tell a guy who has run 9 69 seconds and 19 30 how to react we should be happy
7033871 this was a unique moment a man that as an athlete is making history
7033872 the child in him came out it is his way of expressing himself
7033873 i did not think that michaels record would be broken so quickly i thought maybe my grandchildren would see it
7033874 the strut swagger and superiority complex which everyone is used to seeing on the olympic stage from the crew in the stars and stripes has disappeared and the fans not to mention competitors are loving it
7033875 the relay is all about having fun we are at the olympics we are running well it was a quick time without doing any real work so i enjoyed it

7033881 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7033882 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7033883 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in an end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7033884 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief

7033890 ive heard nothing from arsene wenger himself so it is strange i read his comments and i just thought they were strange bizarre really

7033899 the rapid development of digital technologies offers researchers unprecedented possibilities for the timely and efficient sharing of information our new pilot will harness that potential
7033900 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
7033901 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
7033902 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
7033903 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
7033904 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc
7033905 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
7033906 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds said vahdat if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
7033907 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million
7033908 the woods fund in many ways is responsible for helping start obama as an organizer and shaping his political identity

7033910 the dominant narrative in contemporary school reform is once again focused on exclusion and disadvantage race and class black and white across the us the national governors association declared in 2005 a gap in academic achievement persists between minority and disadvantaged students and their white counterparts this is the commonly referenced and popularly understood racial achievement gap and it drives education policy at every level interestingly whether heartfelt or self satisfied the narrative never mentions the monster in the room white supremacy gloria ladson billings upends all of this with an elegant reversal there is no achievement gap she argues but actually a glancing reflection of something deeper and more profound america has a profound education debt the educational inequities that began with the annihilation of native peoples and the enslavement of africans the conquest of the continent and the importation of both free labor and serfs transformed into apartheid education something anemic inferior inadequate and oppressive over decades and centuries the debt has accumulated and is passed from generation to generation and it continues to grow and pile up

7033926 if you go by my first game ok that was not a good game but if you go by the rest of the year it was an average season so im satisfied with the season i had but obviously i want to have 10 times the better season this year and next year and the next
7033927 it was just a matter of getting more comfortable kicking in those situations sometimes he was fine with it and others he wasnt hes developed a much more consistent approach to that thats really the difference this year

7033935 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
7033936 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
7033937 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
7033938 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
7033939 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
7033940 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
7033941 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
7033942 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
7033943 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it
7033944 wal mart could have actually hired more than 25 percent from the city but by doing this and stopping this project no one in mahoning or trumbull county will see any additional jobs
7033945 we are starving for jobs in this area and this project is being held up by the mayor
7033946 all trustees can do is work with the press to apply more pressure publicly and let the public know exactly what is going on with this situation
7033947 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
7033948 i think saddam either has to be separated from his weapons or taken out of power

7033957 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights we do not have that we can work very hard we can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month other than north korea no other country in the world can achieve this
7033958 this kind of uniformity brings beauty we chinese can do it too
7033959 our program had the highest level of political review since the founding of the peoples republic of china basically all reviews were from the central committee
7033960 we dont see any sign by the chinese leadership that it wants to establish genuine political reform its obvious that the party has no intention of accepting any diminution of its monopoly on power
7033961 barack has chosen joe biden to be his running mate
7033962 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7033963 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7033964 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7033965 i announce to you the good news of the martyrdom of my friend sheikh abu khabab al masri and his pious comrades
7033966 i was just thinking as i was driving up here tonight
7033967 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go a university why is it that my wife is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours its because they didnt have a platform on which to stand
7033968 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because our predecessors were thick does anybody really think that they didnt get what we had because they didnt have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment of course not it was because there was no platform upon which they could stand
7033969 les d g ts caus s par fay nous rappellent quune temp te tropicale na pas besoin datteindre le niveau dun cyclone pour tre dangereuse
7033970 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university
7033971 i think that game the second one dayer is gone its different conditions different wickets in colombo i expect our batsmen to come good tomorrow
7033972 it is a different wicket and a lot firmer than what it used to be the ball will come to bat and there will be more runs the batsmen hold the key and they have to put runs on the board they are the ones who control the game
7033973 you cant say that their indias batting was fragile you probably have to give a bit more credit for our bowlers and the conditions i think they will come back strongly but we are also prepared
7033974 vaas bowled both the days and batted and has not complained or anything he looks pretty good we will have another look tomorrow as well it is only stiffness right now there is a very good chance that he will play
7033975 i think it will probably be the same the only concern would be fitness of vaas i have spoken to the selectors and they were pretty happy on vaas status they were waiting on vaas clearance more or less it will be the same team
7033976 he has a given a huge contribution to lankan cricket it is not an easy task to go for so long and be very consistent especially in the sub continental conditions so hats off to vaas i mean 400 wickets is a great milestone for anybody
7033977 i think vaas and murali have done a fantastic job for quite some time now we have a young brigade who are coming up but these two have been their role models
7033978 honestly we have not thought that much about it we played asia cup in pakistan not that long ago everything was quite okay for us when it comes to security matters
7033979 but it is the cricket board which is going to make that decision right now we are not told anything we are just concentrating on the series at hand
7033980 once we finish this series we will start our preparation for the champions trophy whether it is held in pakistan or elsewhere
7033981 their set was really great everyone seemed to be involved even those who didnt get to see them the first time around everybody seemed to love it

7034091 this put pressure on the others i was very pleased about this i heard some shouts behind me
7034092 i couldnt shake her id open it and shed come back
7034093 there was one more popper climb before the last descent and i tried to shift down and the chain got caught and i had to put my foot down that was third
7034094 it wasnt what i was hoping and dreaming for but its a solid result
7034095 i had a strategy to be conservative at the beginning because i knew people would be blowing up at the end if youre tired you cant make it up those climbs

7034598 ensuring that the network and cable news coverage of barack obamas vice presidential announcement includes their oppo john mccain mccains campaign is going up on the air with an featuring joe biden praising his gop colleague and questioning whether the democrat is ready for the white house
7034599 its a simple ad that really writes itself two clips one from an interview the other from a primary debate that help underscore their central theme
7034600 biden will air in key states per the campaign but in the short term it provides a handy video response to the hours of veep coverage this weekend
7034601 i would be dumbfounded if john mccain would ever engage in a personal attack and he knows i never would with him when they were going after john mccain in south carolina and when they were going after john mccain for having not been in full control of himself because of his days in the prisoner of war camp during the republican primary i called john and said john where do you want me ill show up anywhere in america he was in california and i will testify to your integrity and i will testify as to the soundness of everything you do i think john would have done the same thing for me

7034620 they believe the territory of these states belongs to mexico
7034621 theyll take control of the state governments and start voting themselves anything they want

7034623 i believe passionately in protecting our homeland and securing our borders if my language was hyperbolic the danger it described certainly is not

7034633 and yes theyre absolutely going to continue in the movie franchise but people need to mourn for a while and come to terms with it i dont anticipate that that will subside quickly but once universe is on air and they have kind of their next fix of the stargate franchise i think hopefully people will realize that its in safe hands at sci fi that we really value this franchise and its in our interest and the fans interest to let us continue the story and figure out how to retell it for a new audience every few years

7034653 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat

7034671 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
7034672 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
7034673 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
7034674 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that

7034691 the comparison with zidane is one that is drawn with a lot of the youngsters who come from north african backgrounds
7034692 its quite often that these young kids are likened to him in some sort of way and hes definitely a fine role model to have
7034693 while its flattering to be compared to him initially it can be very detrimental to a young players career especially when youre 17 or that kind of age
7034694 it means people are expecting a lot from you and it can prove restrictive

7034737 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7034738 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for
7034739 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7034740 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7034741 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7034742 but i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7034743 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7034744 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7034745 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7034746 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7034747 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
7034748 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7034749 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who

7034984 the mhra is aware of the issue any regulatory action that may be necessary to minimise harm to patients will be taken once the new information has been carefully reviewed
7034985 based on the information presented by the study investigator and the analyses conducted independently by the university of oxford clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit msp believes the cancer finding is likely to be an anomaly that taken in the light of all the available data does not support an association with vytorin also known as inegy
7034986 we are committed to working with regulatory agencies to further evaluate the available data and interpretations of those data we do not believe that changes in the clinical use of vytorin are warranted of course patients taking vytorin should talk to their doctor if they have questions

7034989 the us should have put their missile system in syria in the 1st place then russia wouldnt feel threatened

7034996 i think music and the cultural aspects of the games will be very important as we move forward to 2012
7034997 in all these areas where our creativity is leading the world l think we will want to showcase that to the world when they look in on london in 2012

7035111 its very clear to us this is a new competition
7035112 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
7035113 the pentagon is quite mindful that congress is more likely to go to bat for boeing if this becomes a sole source contract
7035114 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition

7035123 basically they told england there had been so many changes in the request for proposal that they couldnt compete
7035124 make no mistake this is a different competition for a different airplane and boeing needs sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal
7035125 if we dont get more time there is little option but for us not to bid

7035133 i am concerned the department of defenses bigger is better mentality poses substantial costs to the taxpayers without clearly defined benefits to the warfighter
7035134 nevertheless if dod proceeds with a request for proposal that favors a larger tanker it must provide adequate time for competitors to offer bids
7035135 unknown political risk and constant negative headlines are not likely to induce investors to buy
7035136 we were concerned that the declining oil price and the mechel case would put pressure on the margins of companies and hence their earnings

7035165 the pleasure taken in exacting revenge is not merely personal because the pleasure of revenge is the pleasure of a revolutionary of a marxist leninist who therefore still has a dream the dream of a socialism of the proletariat
7035166 changing the minds of our officers getting them used to living with contradiction teaching them to share the common run of opinion is but one step away from assimilating them into the socialist consensus
7035167 revenge satisfies the ego of the revenger but in truth it opens the way toward the socialist revolution there is a socialist revolutionary process underway in brazil subtle and disguised with a democratic face that is spreading violations of the basic principles of the rule of law
7035168 elections are mere decision making mechanisms the vatican and the comando vermelho criminal gang even have them elections alone are no guarantee of democracy
7035169 those who now rise up against the law that benefited them were not even living in brazil not even working there were living off the money provided by the international conspiracy

7035233 it needs to be understood that at that time he was at milan with different players with different characteristics
7035234 the champions there are different to the champions here we need to think about this balance
7035235 maybe he needs more confidence to train normally and to be given more time now i have nicolas anelka in a good situation and playing well
7035236 i am enjoying it more than i have ever done as long as we win
7035237 when you are younger there is another 10 years in front of you so maybe you dont take it in as much
7035238 i thought about moscow a lot more than i did barcelona in 1999
7035239 i knew it could be the last time i played in the champions league final and i will go into games this season thinking it could be the last time i play in the tournament
7035240 last season ended unbelievably well for the team and myself
7035241 and with the exciting players we have here now hopefully it can get better
7035242 when you look at the potential of this team it can go on and dominate for the next five or 10 years
7035243 we saw glimpses of it was capable of last year the test is now to go on and build on it and i want to be involved at the start
7035244 last season proved how much we needed a big squad
7035245 we were quite lucky at the end because nearly everyone was fit at the champions league final
7035246 but we had injuries throughout the season which we coped with pretty well that experience will only help us
7035247 we do not want to get too far behind at the start because it could be difficult to peg teams back
7035248 last season was an exception when we got two points from three games before that chelsea and arsenal got off to great starts so we want to start winning

7035261 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7035262 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7035263 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7035264 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7035265 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7035266 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7035267 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7035268 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7035269 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7035270 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7035271 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

7035274 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7035275 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7035276 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7035277 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7035278 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7035279 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7035280 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7035281 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7035282 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7035283 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7035284 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7035285 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7035286 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7035287 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7035288 o deputado federal hugo leal psc rj e o ministro da justi a tarso genro participaram de um evento onde o ministro defendeu a lei e disse n o estar preocupado com manifesta es da sociedade pela inconstitucionalidade da lei seca
7035289 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7035290 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7035291 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7035292 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7035293 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7035294 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7035295 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7035296 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7035297 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7035298 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7035299 the more or less constant fertility rate that bulgaria experienced in the communist era plunged by nearly 50 percent in 1990s since this means that the country will lack potential parents in the future bulgaria is faced with the threat of an extremely aged population and presumably growing old age poverty as well by the year 2030
7035300 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7035301 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7035302 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7035303 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7035304 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7035305 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7035306 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7035307 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7035308 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7035309 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7035310 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7035311 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7035312 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7035313 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7035314 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7035315 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7035316 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7035317 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7035318 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7035319 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7035320 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7035321 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7035322 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7035323 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7035324 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7035325 we are trapped in literally there is no way out
7035326 there are people in their trailers still and i dont know how they are doing and the waters are still coming up
7035327 and i really didnt expect this on the third day of the storm
7035328 cadbury dairy milk has over 100 years of heritage and continues to be the number one chocolate brand in the uk worth over 370m in retail sales value the launch of the new cadbury dairy milk cranberry and granola and cadbury dairy milk apricot crumble crunch is expected to build on this success by offering new and exciting combinations and driving incremental sales for retailers whilst also appealing to our loyal and valued cadbury dairy milk consumers
7035329 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7035330 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7035331 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7035332 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7035333 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7035334 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7035335 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7035336 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7035337 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7035338 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7035339 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7035340 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7035341 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7035342 we had a bunch of cats and we put them one by one in cages and on a boat to safety but one is missing his name is blackie he is jet black
7035343 all we had time to grab was a couple of changes of clothes we lost everything to knee deep water in there
7035344 it was only for about 45 minutes when we left it was dry and when we came back we could not go back in
7035345 there is not much you can do with all this water
7035346 i cant talk yet i just found out right now
7035347 this pair tried to steal over 200 million and if convicted they are looking at a maximum of almost 200 years in prison
7035348 to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud bank of america
7035349 i dont see where the fraud is because they are trying to help us and it doesnt seem as if cruz is trying to enrich himself by doing this
7035350 the more students the better especially in times of budget cuts
7035351 all the teachers will keep their jobs the negative side of it is were going to have to make some additional classes and find some additional teachers i guess but its a good problem to have
7035352 the more public schools are spending the more private schools need to spend to offer comparable education
7035353 our area of lake county was one where there was a significant boom in the residential building market as such like other private schools we have had parents who are builders developers mortgage brokers real estate agents etc whose income has been affected by the recent economy
7035354 operating within significant constraints which limit its ability to successfully accomplish its goals
7035355 their grade wouldnt be an a or a plus but its definitely passing
7035356 its not a horrible deal but nasa needs to look at these
7035357 research and development is not the only answer to 6 400 job losses but it should be part of the answer
7035358 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

7035363 earlier this morning a water main at the intersection of broadway and us 1 was damaged water service should be available to those residents however officials are recommending that those affected by the earlier outage take the following precautionary action
7035364 water should be brought to a rolling boil for at least one minute
7035365 half of that is more than what well sell and its good for those guys
7035366 all i can say is weve been here for 10 years and this is our sixth record i feel proud to be able to say that if its not no 1 its not no 1 what are you going to do
7035367 its just a different version of the boy band thing all over again its hanson 2008 with disney behind them how do you compete with that
7035368 it is not for me to make these decisions but there have been such spectacular successes that the honours system is bound to recognise them and will do
7035369 it will consider the results of the olympics and paralympics as well as other achievements in the wider sporting world over the past year
7035370 i think the olympics in 2012 will be spectacular they will be different from beijing
7035371 i think there is more emphasis on our creativity of the sporting legacy that is left after the olympics and on fun
7035372 i think music and the cultural aspects of the games will be very important as we move forward to 2012
7035373 in all these areas where our creativity is leading the world l think we will want to showcase that to the world when they look in on london in 2012

7035381 buy pennants the african american community writes letters to mlb com all the time getting a salary structure in baseball and maybe even limits on the amounts of free agents a team can sign is the best way to give baseball back to the fans

7035389 they said that they didnt know what happened to you that they thought youd been lost at sea richard is lord now
7035390 were going up to the castle to see richard i cant express how horribly yes horribly is a good word anxious i am to talk to him
7035391 the fire must be kept burning on the altar continuously it must not go out

7035393 i will stretch out over jerusalem the measuring line used against samaria and the plumb line used against the house of ahab
7035394 i will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line
7035395 he will judge the world in righteousness he will govern the peoples with justice
7035396 establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever
7035397 to do what is right and just is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice
7035398 he who pursues righteousness and love finds life prosperity and honor

7035400 ever since i went to pharaoh to speak in your name he has brought trouble upon this people and you have not rescued your people at all
7035401 im about to die so what good is a birthright to me
7035402 what is hateful to you do not do to your fellow this is the whole law the rest is the explanation go and learn
7035403 so in everything do to others what you would have them do to you for this sums up the law and the prophets
7035404 if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all

7035407 no todos los psic logos servimos en todos los momentos
7035408 this one will give us comfort from our work and from the toil of our hands from the ground which the lord has cursed
7035409 one of the things i said when i signed for the club was that one of my ambitions was to get players in the scotland squad the fact we are achieving that is brilliant
7035410 i think we cope very well with defeat we did last year and we will this year
7035411 we know we are going to lose games this season as we did last season and still can finish third
7035412 id like to think there are goals in this game and im sure mark would say the same
7035413 both of us have lost a striker over the summer but weve made moves to replace them
7035414 last season there wasnt too much between the sides it was a good fight right to the end for third place and both of us will be hoping its the same again this season
7035415 motherwell havent got off to the start they would have wanted and neither did we so it has been kind of the same for both of us
7035416 i was pleased with the way we played against celtic last weekend and want more of the same while i think motherwell have been unlucky so far
7035417 wie wil werken aan een betere wereld begint bij zich zelf
7035418 je kunt de man uit zijn kluizenaarsbestaan helpen maar het duurt langer om de kluizenaar uit de man te halen
7035419 je bent mijn eerste slachtoffer dat is best een eer dat mag je best iets meer op waarde schatten
7035420 i was impressed by them when they beat us last season
7035421 they are a young confident bunch and im not really surprised that they have came up and started winning because they are used to winning last season in the first division
7035422 so we know its going to be a tough game but we are going to treat it like any other game in the spl
7035423 but we know what we can do and we are quietly confident
7035424 we beat them in the cis cup last season and we won that game quite convincingly
7035425 jim jefferies and the team will be looking to make amends for that so its important we play as well we we can
7035426 no doubt jim will have mentioned the cup defeat to his players and it will be another difficult game as they have started the season well
7035427 it should be a fascinating game but we hope to maintain our unbeaten record with another win at kilmarnock
7035428 nee u hoeft het niet in te pakken ik eet het hier wel op

7035434 he is irreplaceable said charles mwape a member of mwanawasas ruling movement for multiparty democracy mmd
7035435 we have lost a great leader and it will be difficult to fill the gap
7035436 we are deeply devastated as a business community we hope his policies wont change with his death

7035438 there is a significant and increasing body of evidence for a link between mobile phone usage and certain brain tumors
7035439 it is anticipated that this danger has far broader public health ramifications than asbestos and smoking
7035440 the most devastating indictment yet published of the health risks
7035441 emr rays in general cause irritation concentration lapses and in many cases even proliferation of cells which cause cancer
7035442 we are currently experiencing a reactively unchecked and dangerous situation
7035443 in the years 2008 2012 we will have reached the appropriate length of follow up time to begin to definitively observe the impact of this global technology on brain tumor incidence rates

7035445 there is no right more fundamental to a free society than the free practice of religion
7035446 behind walls of prisons and persecuted before our very eyes in places like china iran burma sudan north korea and saudi arabia are tens of thousands of people whose only crime is to worship god in their own way
7035447 as president i intend to make religious freedom a subject of great importance for the united states in our relations with other nations i will work in close concert with democratic allies to raise the prominence of religious freedom in every available forum
7035448 whether in bilateral negotiations or in various multinational organizations to which america belongs i will make respect for the basic principle of religious freedom a priority in international relations
7035449 that denies religious freedom can ever rightly claim to be good in some other way and no person can ever be true to any faith that believes in the dignity of all human life if they do not act out of concern for those whose dignity is assailed because of their faith
7035450 some of the best experts in the mental health field in canada are working with the commission
7035451 the day is coming when a single carrot freshly observed will set off a revolution
7035452 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7035453 players have to feel that their manager believes in them because they are good players and have earned the right to be here
7035454 i can give them that feeling until something tells them that the league is better than they thought and we are struggling against everybody
7035455 i can only imagine thats how derby felt last season that regardless of how much they talked and said they were going to have a real go they were 4 0 down after half an hour thinking this is too much
7035456 until such a time i hope we can impose our style on everton as i felt we imposed our style on portsmouth in the fa cup semi final for a long time
7035457 ultimately we couldnt score against a very well organised defence but i came out of that game thinking that we shouldnt fear the premier league
7035458 portsmouth finished sixth or seventh but we had a lot of the ball against them and gave them a lot of problems
7035459 we have to go into this game thinking we can give them a lot of problems can we score lets hope we have the chances and they go in
7035460 we know they will ask questions and put the ball into our box yakubu will be trying to create something for himself with his strength
7035461 leon osman is a very clever intelligent footballer and mikel arteta is a magician with the ball behind that they have very experienced quality premier league defenders
7035462 the test for us is how are we going to break them down can we score and nullify their problems i dont buy into the club on the decline stuff
7035463 the bottom line is that they have lost andy johnson and the rest is the same squad that finished fifth in the premier league
7035464 they have tim cahill injured but all teams get injuries we are expecting a very tough game against a team who finished fifth in the division and will see us as an opportunity for them
7035465 we have to make sure that we rise to the challenge and impose our game on them to make sure we get some points on the board as early as we can
7035466 im not going to speak on behalf of david moyes but im sure the rumblings are there because when youre in a position of strength and doing well you want more players and to push on
7035467 but they have the stadium project going on in the background and im sure money is a little bit tight for them
7035468 im sure david moyes is concentrating on his team making sure they come to the hawthorns to try and grasp the three points thats on offer
7035469 i would like to think that the team does its talking on the field and that i dont hold us up as any kind of beacon of how a side should play
7035470 its for people to decide whats good and not good and what is aesthetically pleasing and what gets results there is no right or wrong way to win football matches as we found at arsenal you cant play a lovely passing game if you havent got the ball
7035471 it depends on the opposition and now we play everton who finished fifth last season which is no mean feat we know how tough the game is going to be
7035472 they finished fifth probably because they won enough games away from home against teams outside the top four they will see us as an opportunity to get their season up and running having lost last week
7035473 you want to try to get off to a decent start as hull did last week in front of their own fans but if you dont its not the end of the world thats where mental strength comes in and youve got to be ready for the next one
7035474 who is to say you dont lose a few and then win a few on the bounce in an ideal world wouldnt it be great to beat everton to get our season up and running
7035475 but they arent coming to roll over they are coming to us hurting from last week hopefully we have a enough quality on the field to give them problems and win the match

7035484 the needs concerns accomplishments and contributions of the hispanic community as well as the impact of legislation or the lack thereof and its effect on the hispanic community

7035486 babylegs protect crawling babies knees and keep little legs warm especially the often exposed skin between the sock and the bottom of the pant or skirt
7035487 i kept the television off and didnt discuss war with the kids around if they had questions or worries i reminded them that he was going to be as safe as possible and that it was our job to pray for all the soldiers not just daddy i set up individual e mail accounts for each child as they got older but dad was the only one who e mailed them they loved that they always got to talk to him individually whenever he called and as long as it wasnt a school night id wake them even if he called late it was worth the loss of a few minutes of sleep
7035488 consider having daddy say goodbye to the kids at home and then you and only you go with him to the airport its very tough on kids when they see mommy and daddy crying
7035489 its super exciting i dont know what im going to do with him
7035490 there are soldiers over there who deserve a bigger welcome than i do
7035491 seeing all these people for me its no no no theres a bigger team and im just part of the team
7035492 this is the difficult part being home and all the anxiety that goes with it
7035493 having to take care of the whole family on your own hes busy 24 7
7035494 she has the lonely times to wonder what is happening over in afghanistan
7035495 therefore it was decided that there should be an ice fishing contest between the two candidates to determine the winner
7035496 after much of back and forth discussion it was decided that the contest take place on a remote frozen lake in northern minnesota
7035497 there were to be no observers present and both men were to be sent out separately on this isolated lake and return at 5 p m with their catch for counting and verification by a team of neutral parties at the end of the first day
7035498 the public needs to understand my brother that he does this because he is autistic
7035499 hes not doing this to be an a hole or a killjoy or to inconvenience people
7035500 it is something that his mind believes he absolutely must do my mother often describes that he thinks of it as his job his mission he is compelled to do it
7035501 i could have killed myself i could have killed my friend and i could have killed the people inside the showroom
7035502 this was a terrible experience if a cement barrier wasnt there i would have driven right through
7035503 i didnt look at those pills because they looked the same
7035504 both pills were pink id been taking these blood pressure pills every morning without looking at the bottle they looked the same and id been taking the water pills for a long time
7035505 every morning i go to church and during that time i walked like a drunk towards my car
7035506 once i sat down it was okay but so many seniors complain of dizzy spells in mornings so i thought it was because of my age
7035507 there are soldiers over there who deserve a bigger welcome than i do i was just one of the guys seeing all these people for me its no no no theres a bigger team and im just part of the team
7035508 this is the difficult part being home and all the anxiety that goes with it having to take care of the whole family on your own hes busy 24 7 she has the lonely times to wonder what is happening over in afghanistan
7035509 i had difficulty comprehending what the doctor was telling me as i went into a deep shock
7035510 how could this happen to me i dont smoke i eat healthy food and exercise
7035511 cancer is no longer considered a death sentence look at how many of us survived
7035512 but being intellectually aware of breast cancer and the resources available hearing the words and my name in the same sentence my stomach felt like it was in a vice my tongue seemed to have doubled in size my head started to spin and my breathing seemed to stop
7035513 what should i do how and what should i tell my family and how will they react will they be as frightened as me
7035514 now more people are living with cancer rather than dying from it
7035515 i see the toll cancer takes and i always lived my life for today and worry about tomorrow for tomorrow
7035516 my whole being was suddenly overcome with anxiety and an overwhelming fear of the unknown
7035517 whats going to happen what if i have cancer am i am going to die
7035518 i look at cancer as a wake up call for me to live a better life
7035519 i have young children i just want to attend their graduation so i eat a balanced diet i drink a bit of wine and enjoy myself
7035520 it was planted mostly in the 50s and onwards as a replacement for the american elm
7035521 it tends to produce a lot of seed every year
7035522 when it becomes a mature tree it in turn produces a lot of shade
7035523 we actually have a problem with it in the morgan arboretum
7035524 in a park where people are running around the roots the sugar maple is not going to do well
7035525 the bitternut hickory doesnt have a lot of natural range
7035526 and it turns out that a lot of that range falls exactly where a lot of the maple syrup is made
7035527 if one tree gets attacked by an insect or a disease
7035528 the first run in qualifying was okay it was p8
7035529 we had limited running this morning because we had a problem with the car but this morning when we ran prime tyres we were very quick out of the blocks i think we were third quickest at one time
7035530 but on the option tyre when we put it on this morning we made some set up changes which is obviously the wrong thing to do because the lap was slow and we put it down to the changes that we made
7035531 the prime run was good in qualifying but the option run was slower and the car felt completely different on the option and was not very competitive whereas the prime was very good
7035532 its massively disappointing i didnt think we would just be in q2 i thought we would be in q3

7035535 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7035536 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7035537 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7035538 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7035539 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7035540 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7035541 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7035542 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7035543 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7035544 if a customer orders dog meat restaurant staff should patiently suggest another entree
7035545 the british also balk at the thought of eating horsemeat and just across the channel have always launched this disgust at the french who have always included horsemeat as palatable
7035546 there are many people in britain who think that dogs and horses are higher forms of life that humanity
7035547 they are extremely inconsistent in that they consider other forms of life to be entirely worthy of eradication so in britain over the centuries all sorts of species have become extinct including the wolf
7035548 isnt it funny that they drove the wolf to extinction but have spent the last 60 years worshipping dogs
7035549 they took away all the real jobs that dogs ever had

7035552 the morning pages write like your life depended on it
7035553 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7035554 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7035555 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7035556 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7035557 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7035558 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7035559 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7035560 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7035561 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7035562 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7035563 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7035564 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7035565 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7035566 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7035567 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7035568 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7035569 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7035570 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7035571 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7035572 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7035573 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7035574 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510

7035579 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7035580 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7035581 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7035582 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7035583 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7035584 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7035585 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7035586 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7035587 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7035588 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7035589 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7035590 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7035591 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7035592 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7035593 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7035594 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7035595 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7035596 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
7035597 a boeing 747 operated by virgin atlantic has had a precautionary landing at the airport it is safely down it has been taken to a remote stand where passengers are being taken off
7035598 weve warned the government that wed target police if the army did not stop operations against us
7035599 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7035600 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7035601 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7035602 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7035603 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7035604 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7035605 i had the awesome privilege to look in to linux certification this past week you know like how when novell says suse runs well on some laptops then well it should
7035606 what i do find annoying is that novell is continuing to feed microsofts fud machine about linux
7035607 as microsoft is set to pump up to 100 million more in novell for linux its important to note that microsoft is not paying off linux rants and laughs
7035608 im getting way behind on these things so im combining the rants and laughs posts into one series i can feel that were sco goes down and suns in trouble
7035609 the decision is in and sco has gone down in defeat
7035610 the linux embedded discussion list has been abuzz the last two days over a flash filesystem designed to support binary code execution sometimes called xip or

7035614 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred in a coalition forces operation in herat province
7035615 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenades fire the joint forces responded with small arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants
7035616 last nigh at 2 00 a m some people were attending a holy koran recitation when american started the bombings
7035617 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7035618 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7035619 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7035620 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7035621 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7035622 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7035623 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7035624 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7035625 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7035626 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7035627 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7035628 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
7035629 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
7035630 one of obamas biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion
7035631 i guess if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
7035632 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
7035633 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7035634 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
7035635 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
7035636 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
7035637 these fine athletes will be icons for the people of trinidad and tobago and have shown them what they can accomplish with their lives
7035638 three of the four athletes thompson callender and bledman were participating in their first olympic games
7035639 you have made trinidad and tobago proud and you have lifted the spirits of the entire country
7035640 i am really relieved that marc got a medal he has really worked hard all season and was disappointed that he did not medal in the final of the 100 metres which usain bolt won
7035641 i am really very happy for the guys we got the silver medal they have done tt very proud
7035642 i think these two guys really did well they came in as replacements and when people thought that we would not have had a chance at a medal they stepped up to the challenge and helped us to get silver
7035643 he kept up with him and it was only the slip up that may have cost us a chance at the gold medal

7035655 mccain spokes doberman brian rogers had this to say the reality is they have some investment properties and stuff its not as if he lives in ten houses thats just not the case rogers said the reality is they have four that actually could be considered houses they could use that makes it better doesnt it only four houses wow that guy really knows what life is like for most of us and then there is this which many people are starting to point out is becoming a very tired response and one that might end up costing mccain some votes he also added this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison referring to the prisoner of war camp that mccain was in during the vietnam war

7035665 the archaeological resources of johnsons island are certainly unique nowhere else does there exist time capsules in the form of latrines from the american civil war giving us a few months at a time of how prisoners were treated nowhere else does there exist such a wealth of primary documents giving us a day to day account of how these prisoners saw their predicament combined this provides the best field laboratory for demonstrating not only the science of archaeology but also a chapter of american history as seen through prisoners of war

7035690 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7035691 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7035692 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7035693 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7035694 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7035695 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7035696 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7035697 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7035698 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7035699 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7035700 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
7035701 we will have to see what other issues were present

7035705 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7035706 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7035707 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7035708 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7035709 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7035710 i commend senator obama for selecting senator joe biden as his candidate for vice president of the united states senator biden is a stalwart leader on international affairs and a strong man of character
7035711 as a member of the house foreign affairs committee i have worked with senator biden on several important issues facing the world and have found him to be one of the most knowledgeable leaders on the international stage senator obama is to be commended for taking the time to pick a running mate who will help restore americas reputation in the world i look forward to an exciting democratic convention in denver
7035712 the challenger does a lot of things very well and the factory srt8 is a great car to start with

7035717 its my first performance in a k1 final so i cant complain really i gave it everything i had
7035718 i had the edge taken off from yesterday i didnt quite have the gusto that i wanted from the first few strokes
7035719 i bided my time until halfway when i kicked i gave it everything i had and i caught up a fair bit but that last 100m i was starting to get jelly arms again
7035720 four more years to go weve got some great talent at home

7035754 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
7035755 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7035756 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7035757 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7035758 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7035759 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7035760 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7035761 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7035762 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7035763 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7035764 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7035765 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7035766 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7035767 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7035768 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7035769 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7035770 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7035771 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7035772 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7035773 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7035774 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7035775 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7035776 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7035777 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7035778 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7035779 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7035780 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7035781 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7035782 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7035783 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7035784 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7035785 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7035786 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7035787 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7035788 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7035789 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7035790 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7035791 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7035792 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7035793 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7035794 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7035795 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7035796 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7035797 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7035798 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7035799 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7035800 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7035801 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7035802 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7035803 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7035804 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7035805 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7035806 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7035807 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7035808 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7035809 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7035810 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7035811 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7035812 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7035813 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7035814 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7035815 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7035816 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7035817 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7035818 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7035819 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7035820 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7035821 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7035822 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7035823 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7035824 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7035825 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7035826 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

7035828 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7035829 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7035830 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7035831 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7035832 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7035833 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7035834 this is a planning took where all things are going
7035835 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7035836 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7035837 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7035838 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7035839 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7035840 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7035841 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7035842 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7035843 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7035844 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7035845 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7035858 ive got a lot of family and support here im ready to go out and get some things done
7035859 the experience devin had with us in the past and how successful he was able to blend his talents in with a lot of these players are key reasons we made the signing
7035860 he has the ability to play the off guard we think in addition to chris and mike james the three of them all have the ball handling and the varying skill sets for us to use at the point position as well as some off the ball
7035861 we like the depth it creates for us in a number of areas and the experience he has

7035882 in general it is fair to say that market forces are already achieving significant improvement broadband availability in maine has for example risen substantially just in the past year but it also seems clear that for the many rural areas of maine market forces alone may be insufficient to achieve full availability and coverage in the near term

7035919 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7035920 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7035921 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7035922 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7035923 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7035924 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7035925 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7035926 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be

7035950 be sober minded be watchful your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour
7035951 what is needed is restoration of the dialogue process to bring the state back to normalcy
7035952 performed at or above proficiency in reading as opposed to 67 7 of conventional public school students
7035953 there is no need to set up new threats to schools for not performing
7035954 despite desperate efforts to make the voucher debate about school choice and improving opportunities for low income students vouchers remain an elitist strategy
7035955 if there was any argument for vouchers it was lets see if the experiment works and if it does whatever my preconception you do what is best for the kids
7035956 that throughout his career he has voted against voucher proposals
7035957 public education should be defined as one in which our public support for a childs education follows that child into the school the parent chooses
7035958 school choice for all who want it and expansion of opportunity scholarships will all be a part of a serious agenda of education reform
7035959 one is in very close danger of punishing a child for coming from a good home or going to a good school
7035960 there would be uproar if we tried to take into account this data when selecting our olympic team we dont seem to be able to recognise talent and develop talent as we do in the sporting arena
7035961 the lower the average performance of the school the more weight may be given to the candidate whose past examination performance significantly exceeds their schools average performance
7035962 admissions tutors have discretion to make conditional offers which differ from the typical entry requirement if in their judgement the typical entry requirement would not be appropriate because of the particular circumstances of an applicant
7035963 one of whom is predicted to achieve aab at a level while the other is heading for aaa
7035964 the first attends a school that is dealing with many educational challenges and where aab is exceptional
7035965 the second attends a school where aaa is not unusual he or she has an uninspiring reference and a lacklustre personal statement we think that offering a place to the first candidate rather than the second is both fair and in tune with our desire to recruit the students with the strongest academic qualities
7035966 admission is based on academic merit the college will not lower its admission standards as a means of widening access
7035967 a lot of guessing goes into the decision and there should be more objective information
7035968 giving full information to people would mean that they can actually know whats going on and rather than judging individual schools or school systems on the basis of myths rumour prejudice or perception people would have the facts
7035969 im not sure that is the case at the moment perhaps as worrying as that statement is from the point of view of being the federal education minister i couldnt tell because the amount of information thats available doesnt enable me to make that judgment in a meaningful way
7035970 so i think the more information thats available to parents the better
7035971 people will still make choices for a wide variety of reasons
7035972 there should be very strong national standards and national assessments so we can say what it actually means to graduate from a high school rather than letting each state set its own benchmark
7035973 australian children are going to have to compete with kids all over the world so the opportunity to set really strong standards and make the information about them transparent to parents to educators to everybody seems to me to be a very intelligent central government function
7035974 put it this way if she ms gillard were to make everything transparent showing progress tying it to meaningful national assessments but without putting a letter grade on schools she would have accomplished a great deal
7035975 i think the power of letter grades is that they focus the mind but data and information will also focus the mind and you never want the best to be the enemy of the good
7035976 peer grouping methodologies are very important to enable genuine comparisons of like with like
7035977 we know that kids across the nation go to schools with a set of abilities and challenges and we know that schools that cater for disadvantaged communities tend to be working with more students who need extra assistance
7035978 whats got a negative reaction from many around the place is the sense that was pushed very strongly by the howard government that all of this was going to be about raw scores
7035979 school leaders and schoolteachers i think would respond well to feeling there is going to be an objective measurement and understanding of the nature of the particular task they face
7035980 were looking at a model about supplementing resources to make a difference for disadvantaged schools rather than a rewards based model
7035981 one would be in a better position to work out which schools need extra assistance a better position to then measure the difference that the extra assistance and implemented programs make that evaluation would enable us to identify and spread best practice

7036072 a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government it can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from the public treasure from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most money from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy followed by a dictatorship the average age of the worlds great civilizations has been two hundred years these nations have progressed through the following sequence from bondage to spiritual faith from spiritual faith to great courage from courage to liberty from liberty to abundance from abundance to selfishness from selfishness to complacency from complacency to apathy from apathy to dependency from dependency back to bondage

7036154 v lipi imamo vizijo in jasne cilje postavili smo se v bran vrednotam iz leta 91 ko je bila slovenija dobra blagovna znamka in smo si upali sanjati
7036155 na cilj je do leta 2012 v politiko vrniti na elnost in po tenje tega je bilo v iztekajo em mandatu premalo slovenija rabi nove vrednote a enje denarja ki ga je vpeljala ta vlada se namre mora nehati
7036156 verjamem v uspeh ker slovenija potrebuje novo mo ljudje pa druga no politiko ki bo znala spo tovati potrebe vsakega posameznika aktualna vlada je za ela graditi zidove med ljudmi in dr avo
7036157 slovenija je pred tirimi leti sklenila pakt s hudi em
7036158 to si bodo morali zapomniti tudi slovenski kvazi politi ni analitiki ki namesto da bi predstavljali javno mnenje ga elijo ustvarjati
7036159 in verjamem da nas bo v naslednjem mandatu najmanj osem enako delavnih zato je prav da je obstoje o vlado strah lipe

7036165 u s citizenship is still one of the worlds most precious commodities
7036166 i am confident that the community will support this appeal and will come forward with information because to have information and not provide it means you are as guilty as those who tried to carry out the murders
7036167 we need to catch those who did this and we need active community involvement to achieve this
7036168 the threat comes from a small group of individuals who have little or no support
7036169 these so called dissidents must see clearly that the people of this country have made the choice to support law and order to support safety and security and to support those men and women who put on the police uniform to deliver that safety and security
7036170 we need local people to come forward with information which will help us help us to put these individuals behind bars and make the community safer for everyone
7036171 since world war ii our airborne forces have earned an impressive reputation
7036172 they are known around the world because of their discipline their tenacity and their will to win
7036173 the sky dragons of the xviii airborne corps and all paratroopers have continued to maintain a professional warrior reputation through their actions here in iraq which is extremely important in a counterinsurgency environment
7036174 as i walk through markets in places like mosul and sadr city it is clear to me that iraqi citizens have faith and trust in our troopers and that is absolutely necessary for us to achieve our goals
7036175 it feels great to be able to take part in history and it was a nice surprise
7036176 i was made aware yesterday that i was going to be able to take part in the cake cutting and im really glad i did
7036177 you cant help but feel proud to be airborne during a ceremony like this
7036178 this is a great step to work towards the future in abu tshir
7036179 when kids return to the school and see it is in good condition they will be very happy

7036189 i got released from portland state and schools were able to talk to me and thats when west virginia came in after my high school coach heard that they needed a running back
7036190 we sent a tape out here and they liked it and they offered me
7036191 i got offered from washington state and some other schools
7036192 washington state was one of my top choices because thats where my brother went
7036193 the town was fun it was no different from home as far as people wise and how they treat you
7036194 my brother from washington state he always told it was much faster and he wasnt lying its true the defense is fast
7036195 they are all great players im just trying to learn it they had learned the playbook at the running back position before me
7036196 im just trying to catch up to them and well all be battling for the second position we all have talent they are all good players
7036197 i love this offense the passing and the running coach mullen is a great coach
7036198 as far as time wise ive caught up on my sleep its pretty good im used to it
7036199 school for the last few days has been pretty good im learning my way around campus i like the people its very nice out here the community is nice its a nice place to be and im happy with my decision
7036200 i can come during the week but on saturdays i like to spend time here
7036201 we had to make decisions based on the number of staff we had
7036202 these are the people who need the library the most
7036203 the reduction in revenues and the reduction in property values throughout the community requires cuts and the library is one of them
7036204 i feel like were fortunate weve made progress over the years and its just a shame that instead of the status quo were having to go backwards
7036205 why did you place a cap of 94 million on the bonus funds we met our mark but you didnt meet yours i feel that it was discussed but not in an open forum im very upset about this and i know im not the only educator that feels this way
7036206 the school bonus has grown over the years because more schools are making it
7036207 this year we had a 40 or 50 million increase for school buses gas and it was a tough decision to make each budget goes through committee and there were two readings on the floor and we didnt cut anybody off from saying anything weve heard from a lot of teachers across north carolina and theres been a lot of discussion about what to do about funding it and it depends on how our revenues come in
7036208 this has been bad policy for us weve had five teacher workdays taken away from us that we badly need high schools are not allowed out before break and its detrimental for their exams and for their ayp scores we need your help to get this back
7036209 the state needed stronger rules to deal with your situation we have a much better set of laws now than when your situation came along
7036210 especially with the drought we want to correct waterline leaks
7036211 we appropriated 100 million last year and 50 million this year which is available on a competitive basis there was not serious discussion this session on a large bond referendum for water and sewer because of our exploding university population and our mental health hospitals i dont see a silver bullet for it
7036212 weve been trying to keep the n c rural center funded and it hasnt been easy they like to tie the money to the jobs coming in to the building
7036213 i know the textile and furniture industries leaving has left valuable buildings here and we want to help in any way we can
7036214 williams sonoma does 3 9 billion do they really need the corporate welfare from the state of north carolina
7036215 now that someone has a competitive advantage over someone whos working and investing and supporting the community how can you help the local people
7036216 we would have loved to provide ample warning to network creators about this decision the difficulty is that im not sure there would have been a way for us to do so that didnt violate the privacy of parties involved
7036217 america is today the strongest the most influential and most productive nation in the world understandably proud of this pre eminence we yet realize that americas leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress riches and military strength but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment
7036218 throughout americas adventure in free government such basic purposes have been to keep the peace to foster progress in human achievement and to enhance liberty dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations
7036219 any failure traceable to arrogance or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us a grievous hurt both at home and abroad
7036220 a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment our arms must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction
7036221 do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they

7036238 here are riches from which to choose that will provide golden pleasure in the present and build strong character from the future an educator i know says that adults read to find out what others think while children read to find out what they themselves believe from her experience with students of high school age she has found that the right young people with ideals and principles with standards of right and wrong come from homes where reading together is basic to the family pattern through the process of identifying and suffering with the characters in their books children tend to become like those admired

7036242 well i was in two different homerooms before i found mine
7036243 well i went in the hall when they called my name and there were two groups i went with the one that i thought that i was supposed to go with and then i got lost so i asked two cheerleaders who were in the hall and they took me to the room and then the teacher goes whos name didnt i call and when i told him mine he said i was in the wrong room and pointed me to another room which wasnt my room but the next one down was so i got there right as they were all going to learn to open their lockers
7036244 de heerser over de russische aarde is steeds de rus dit was zo en zal steeds zo zijn
7036245 de heerser over de russische aarde is steeds de rus dit was zo en zal steeds zo zijn
7036246 als je de keus hebt tussen nietsdoen en iets stoms doen is het beter om niets te doen
7036247 saakasjvili had moeten weten dat een militair optreden tegen zuid osseti een zelfmoordactie is hij had moeten weten dat hij met het russische leger te maken zou krijgen het is onduidelijk hoe het militaire offensief tegen georgi tot stand kwam maar als die was gepland dan vraag ik me af hoe men ooit zon aanval kon beginnen
7036248 als hij daarop heeft gerekend moet men echt aan zijn verstand twijfelen vanuit het westen is hem telkens weer duidelijk gemaakt wij ondersteunen de territoriale integriteit van georgi maar we zijn tegen een militaire oplossing van het conflict zelfs de vs hielden hem voor wees voorzichtig
7036249 foutieve gedachte dat hij saakasjvili dt vrienden heeft aan het hof
7036250 daarna zijn de provocaties van de osseten begonnen de plunderingen van georgische dorpen saakasjvili kon niet niet reageren
7036251 hij had geen keus in ieder geval zouden de russen vroeg of laat zijn binnengevallen net zoals dat is gebeurd in augustus 1999 in tsjetsjeni
7036252 het ging erom definitief te voorkomen dat georgi lid wordt van de navo de russische autoriteiten wilden het georgische leger vernietigen en het huidige regime met zijn president voor wie vladimir poetin dezelfde hardnekkige haat voelt als voor de oligarch michail chodorkovski de oud topman van het oliebedrijf yukos die tot acht jaar strafkamp is veroordeeld dt wat de russen leken te beogen is een federale staat met zeer beperkte macht waarvan de veiligheid zou worden gegarandeerd door het russische leger

7036259 the abortion rate is dropping now we must continue to support efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies and we call on all americans to take personal responsibility to meet this important goal
7036260 but it also says the party supports the choice to have a child
7036261 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
7036262 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7036263 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7036264 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7036265 cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
7036266 and look tim if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it some things are worth losing over that would be worth losing over hundreds of lives are being saved and will be saved by us sending these vehicles over which we are funding with this supplemental legislation and i want to ask any of my other colleagues would they in fact vote to cut off the money for those troops to protect them thats the right question this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
7036267 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic

7036274 no dir a que soy un fen meno m s bien un gran atleta
7036275 estas cosas pueden cambiar mi vida pero yo no cambiar intent estar relajado dando vueltas en la pista para no pensar mucho en la carrera no permito que la gente me meta presi n cuando disfruto me sirve para concentrarme todav a me divierto soy joven el atletismo es lindo y hay que disfrutarlo

7036285 a man who was merely a man and said the sort of things jesus said would not be a great moral teacher he would either be a lunatic on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg or he would be the devil of hell you must take your choice either this was and is the son of god or else a madman or something worse you can shut him up for a fool or you can fall at his feet and call him lord and god but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher he has not left that open to us

7036373 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
7036374 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
7036375 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7036376 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7036377 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7036378 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7036379 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7036380 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
7036381 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7036382 if you trust every web site but not a government
7036383 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official is it possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7036384 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7036385 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
7036386 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7036387 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including
7036388 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7036389 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7036390 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
7036391 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
7036392 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
7036393 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
7036394 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
7036395 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
7036396 for the time being there is nothing i can add
7036397 if you trust every web site but not a government there are so many web sites so much hearsay
7036398 these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
7036399 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
7036400 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
7036401 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
7036402 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
7036403 fair play is an important aspect of the olympic movement and the ioc is responsible for ensuring that everybody is playing by the rules this issue needs to be resolved and it needs to be behind us once the ioc feels it has done everything in its power to resolve it everyone is going to have to accept that at some level

7036413 the first of these purports to show that it follows just from the concept of god that god does exist the second makes the stronger claim that god exists necessarily or in other words that god possesses a kind of existence that is possessed by no other thing it was essentially the first argument that was subsequently developed with such clarity by descartes and largely for this reason it is this version that has received the most celebrated and devastating criticism

7036502 fedora is involved because we track the kernel very aggressively
7036503 the kerneloops capability also supports our dedication to a healthy cooperation with upstream software providers like the kernel developer community it leverages the widespread use of fedora for the direct benefit of that community who can see measurable results of their work and shift resources as needed to target frequent or important issues
7036504 in general kernel developers are open to kerneloops since the more reports i have the more data they have
7036505 if you have one report it could just be a fluke but if youve got 500 reports of the same pattern you know its a real bug
7036506 we are fixing the bugs that have a lot of people hitting them
7036507 if you look at the number of unique bugs the numbers can be confusing for the 2 6 25 kernel there were 1 300 bugs only half of which only happened once we do fix a lot of bugs but if you look at what we fix its the ones that actually matter

7036509 what kerneloops is doing is wonderful in helping the upstream kernel developers track what is going wrong and what needs to be fixed
7036510 of course more users testing the nightly kernel releases of the main kernel org tree is very helpful in finding problems that happen during the development cycle but that being said the linux kernel has a very good record of quality and stability over time
7036511 its important to track bugs and get visibility into what is causing them
7036512 but its also just one arrow in our quality improvement quiver

7036516 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7036517 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7036518 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7036519 he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7036520 if the club sells one or two more players its not a problem for me
7036521 i dont know if some clubs want shaun in the last game he played 25 30 minutes and he has played for the second time in the first group of training
7036522 i dont know what the player is thinking about with regards offers from other teams if i have 24 25 players with me and three or four for every two positions then im happy i have three or four players in this wing right and wing left position
7036523 after 30 minutes we scored two goals and i was more relaxed
7036524 i think in my opinion we are not better than arsenal because they won and had three points we are not better than liverpool because they also won
7036525 we need now to win again against wigan and maybe arsenal or liverpool draw or lose then we are in the best position
7036526 some people said it only depended on aung san suu kyi but that is not true

7036581 linux calls it oops but its basically equivalent to a windows blue screen
7036582 its kind of the same thing in terms of what causes it and what it does except we dont make it blue we just print the message
7036583 fedora is involved because we track the kernel very aggressively
7036584 the kerneloops capability also supports our dedication to a healthy cooperation with upstream software providers like the kernel developer community it leverages the widespread use of fedora for the direct benefit of that community who can see measurable results of their work and shift resources as needed to target frequent or important issues
7036585 in general kernel developers are open to kerneloops since the more reports i have the more data they have
7036586 if you have one report it could just be a fluke but if youve got 500 reports of the same pattern you know its a real bug
7036587 we are fixing the bugs that have a lot of people hitting them
7036588 if you look at the number of unique bugs the numbers can be confusing for the 2 6 25 kernel there were 1 300 bugs only half of which only happened once we do fix a lot of bugs but if you look at what we fix its the ones that actually matter
7036589 in a few months from now it might be something different
7036590 what kerneloops is doing is wonderful in helping the upstream kernel developers track what is going wrong and what needs to be fixed
7036591 of course more users testing the nightly kernel releases of the main kernel org tree is very helpful in finding problems that happen during the development cycle but that being said the linux kernel has a very good record of quality and stability over time
7036592 its important to track bugs and get visibility into what is causing them

7036599 il sistema elettronico che garantisce la nostra sicurezza a bordo del free gaza e liberty e stato assaltato e incastrato entrambi le navi battenti bandiera greca sono in acque internazionali siamo vittime di pirateria elettronica siamo attualmente in gms p are a2 e ci affidiamo allequipaggiamento delle comunicazioni satellitari per fare una chiamata angosciosa se necessario siamo civili di 17 nazioni sul questo progetto di rompere lassedio di gaza non siamo esperti navigatori come conseguenza ce la preoccupazione per la salute e la sicurezza delle persone a bordo in caso di emergenza attualmente stiamo sperimentando condizioni di mare tempestoso e richiamiamo il governo greco e la comunit internazionale alle loro responsabilita e protezione dei civili a bordo delle due imbarcazioni in acque internazionali
7036600 the electronic systems which guarantee our safety aboard the ss free gaza and ss liberty have been jammed and scrambled
7036601 tax reform is desperately needed in the united states but before we can reform the tax code we must sharply reduce the tax burden on americans made necessary
7036602 the american people simply cannot afford more of the same which means more government spending more special interest pay offs more fraud and waste and continuing to treat american taxpayers like geese to be plucked rather than citizens of a free society and democratic republic
7036603 the individuals right to keep and bear arms helps ensure all of our freedoms the supreme courts recognition of the constitutional right to gun ownership is a recognition of the right to life liberty and property for all americans
7036604 we must address the issue of climate change but do so realistically recognizing the importance of simultaneously expanding energy supplies and maintaining economic growth our greatest strength in confronting the problems of the future is our free market economy only by reducing government barriers to private research and development are we going to achieve the innovative even transformational changes necessary in the years and decades ahead
7036605 america should not be the worlds policeman the american purpose is to provide a strong national defense not to engage in nation building or to launch foreign crusades no matter how seemingly well intentioned
7036606 neither the republicans nor the democrats can be trusted to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the american people as president i would never forget that it is a free society which we must defend we must never sacrifice the individual freedoms that make america so unique
7036607 our doors are fema doors they are rated for 200 miles per hour winds so we could withstand a category 5 hurricane or any hurricane that comes through
7036608 they actually have backup generators that were not working we deployed there and got them up and running
7036609 with fay for example if the winds were a lot worse and things went down they would be secure here
7036610 there is redundancy here to keep their networks up and running
7036611 it is our aim to provide well being for the natives and a prosperous future for their children with building respected peaceful and innovative community islam is the pillars and democracy is the basic foundation while the edifice depicts all that is required abiding the law and helping the people to obey as the party bows to justice and judiciary the onus is enormous and it is the partys responsibility to protect islam and the constitution of the republic and to serve while defending its rights
7036612 we must not make an enemy among us or single out one as we saw our enemy being the system which was levied creeping thru our minds in double standards bringing hassle and forging hatred among us it is the system that neglected the peoples rights and lead the youth to illicit world of narcotics and removing the shelter from the peoples head it is also the system that brought the nation on their knees the public begging for their health

7036650 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7036651 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7036652 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7036653 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7036709 the aim of the cycle of upsurges is really to gain attention both in the public press and the international media theres no evidence to suggest its going away its almost certain there will be further large scale attacks over the next few months
7036710 there are periods of high activity alternating with periods of low activity because the group cannot sustain the pace of attacks over a long period they need to re group to prepare for the next round

7036757 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7036758 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7036759 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7036760 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7036761 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7036762 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7036763 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7036764 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7036765 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems

7036775 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7036776 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7036777 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7036778 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7036779 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7036780 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7036781 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7036782 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7036783 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7036784 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7036785 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7036786 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7036787 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
7036788 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
7036789 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
7036790 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
7036791 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
7036792 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
7036793 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
7036794 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
7036795 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
7036796 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average
7036797 its not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of man made warming on polar ice melt
7036798 i will make a commitment that al gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem hes somebody i talk to on a regular basis im already consulting with him in terms of these issues but climate change is real
7036799 possible to kill more flies with honey than with vinegar
7036800 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7036801 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7036802 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7036803 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7036804 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7036805 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7036806 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7036807 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7036808 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7036809 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7036810 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7036811 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7036812 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7036813 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7036814 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7036815 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7036816 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7036817 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7036818 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7036819 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7036820 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7036821 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7036822 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7036823 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7036824 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7036825 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7036826 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7036827 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7036828 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7036829 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7036830 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7036831 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7036832 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7036833 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7036834 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7036835 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7036836 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7036837 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7036838 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7036839 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7036840 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7036841 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7036842 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7036843 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7036844 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7036845 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7036846 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7036847 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7036848 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7036849 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7036850 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7036851 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7036852 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7036853 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7036854 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7036855 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7036856 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7036857 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7036858 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7036859 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7036860 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7036861 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7036862 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7036863 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7036864 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7036865 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7036866 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7036867 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7036868 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7036869 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7036870 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7036871 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7036872 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7036873 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7036874 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7036875 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7036876 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7036877 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7036878 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7036879 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7036880 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7036881 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7036882 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7036883 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7036884 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7036885 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7036886 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7036887 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7036888 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7036889 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7036890 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7036891 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7036892 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7036893 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7036894 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7036895 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7036896 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7036897 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7036898 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7036899 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7036900 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7036901 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7036902 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7036903 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7036904 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7036905 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7036906 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7036907 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7036908 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7036909 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7036910 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7036911 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands

7036917 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7036918 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7036919 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7036920 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7036921 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7036922 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7036923 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7036924 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7036925 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7036926 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7036927 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7036928 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7036929 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7036930 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7036931 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7036932 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7036933 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7036934 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7036935 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7036936 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7036937 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7036938 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7036939 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7036940 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7036941 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7036942 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7036943 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7036944 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7036945 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7036946 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7036947 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7036948 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7036949 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7036950 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7036951 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be

7036965 science should inform regulatory and public health decisions about issues such as the accumulation of mercury in our environment
7036966 the superfund basic research program provides support for workshops such as these that interpret findings in terms useful to decision makers that incorporate their perspectives into the research agenda

7037026 we ought not rashly to conclude that any one has brought on himself the judgment of eternal death on the contrary love should dispose us to hope well but if the impiety of some appear to us not otherwise than hopeless as though the lord pointed it out by the finger we ought not to contend with the just judgment of god or seek to be more merciful than he is
7037027 we should pray for others as well as for ourselves beseeching the lord to pardon and recover the fallen as well as to relieve the tempted and afflicted and let us be truly thankful that no sin of which any one truly repents is unto death

7037069 its not often a day to day product can be so simply and easily improved
7037070 the best way that the industry can help is to do a few simple things add a warning entry page with no images and require some form of age verification such as larry walters birthdate verifier and add the rta meta data code to your websites
7037071 this is important for many reasons including the fact that the industry does not want children to view its content and if sites are labeled with rta it gives control to parents to determine what content they want their children to view by using a parental control system such as the parental control bar
7037072 last but not least if the industry does not self label the government will either make it mandatory or start to look at other solutions such as the xxx tld
7037073 the expectation by the government and prosecutors is that adult websites are responsible for making sure minors do not access adult websites unfortunately current technological solutions to achieve that result are limited
7037074 ultimately the issue will be resolved by bio tech solutions like fingerprint or retina scans but for now the best solution seems to be to put the burden back on the user to ensure that some consequence is attached to accessing a site that is restricted in some way
7037075 we developed a way to use two different federal laws as a means to generate an electronic affidavit of age rendering the user liable for perjury if a misstatement of age is presented
7037076 such access would also make the user potentially liable as a hacker or trespasser when appropriate terms and conditions are tied to the birthdateverifier form
7037077 it would be difficult for the government to find an underage witness who could competently testify that he or she gained access to content protected by the birthdateverifier since that witness would have committed perjury and already demonstrated a propensity for false statements under oath
7037078 i can assure you that we are only looking to glorify dingdong dantes and will only mention him and your footage in a positive light the show is scheduled to air in the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2008 we do not have a more specific time frame as of yet

7037087 based on the fact that he is known to me as an armed and dangerous person and associated with the hells angels i took his assertion that he knew where i worked as a veiled threat
7037088 of course he knew where he worked how is that a threat
7037089 telling a police detective that you know where he works at is a bigger crime ok being a member of the hells angels outlaw motorcycle gang is even a bigger crime

7037111 any continued movement of capital out of russia could prove disastrous as we noted above russia really is a hollow economy its growth kept afloat by soaring oil prices and a commodity boom which have both boosted investment in russia and made its overall economy look much better than it is in fact russia is an economic nightmare in slow motion due to poor health care and widespread alcoholism its population is declining by 500 000 a year a trend thats expected to accelerate in coming years inflation is revving up again after declining for several years and now is growing at about a 14 yearly rate and rising that means essentially there has been no growth at all for 20 years of the 15 former soviet republics that got their freedom after the collapse of communism 11 are growing faster than russia based on its demographic implosion and lack of a non oil economy our guess is russia is in for a rough couple of decades not the boom times many have predicted if foreign investors keep looking for the exits russias good times may be over for good until russias move into georgia there seemingly had been only massive capital inflows thanks mainly to the rising price of oil which makes up 20 of russias gross domestic product now it seems investors are fed up with the rampant militaristic nationalism red tape corruption and anti investor sentiment in vladimir putins russia some have decided to head for the door and take their money with them

7037147 i think the olympics in 2012 will be spectacular they will be different from beijing
7037148 i think there is more emphasis on our creativity of the sporting legacy that is left after the olympics and on fun
7037149 i think music and the cultural aspects of the games will be very important as we move forward to 2012
7037150 in all these areas where our creativity is leading the world l think we will want to showcase that to the world when they look in on london in 2012

7037215 public confidence in the mmr vaccine is now high with more than 8 out of 10 children receiving one dose of mmr by their second birthday
7037216 however low vaccine uptake over the past decade means there is now a large group of children who either havent been vaccinated or who have received just one dose these children are susceptible to not only measles but to mumps and rubella as well
7037217 2007 saw the highest number of measles cases recorded in england and wales since the current method of monitoring the disease was introduced in 1995
7037218 measles is a very serious infection as it can lead to pneumonia and encephalitis it is not possible to tell who will be seriously affected by measles this is why its incredibly important to continue to remind parents about the benefits of having their child vaccinated with two doses of mmr for optimum protection it is never too late to get vaccinated
7037219 these cases and outbreaks serve as a reminder that measles can and still does occur in the united states
7037220 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
7037221 the vaccine against measles is highly effective in preventing infections and high immunization levels in the community are effective at preventing or drastically decreasing the size of outbreaks

7037276 i think its going to expand very quickly i think the next country to jump in is china theres been a lot of progress in terms of contractual law development there and certainly a lot of interest in large projects
7037277 as the asia infrastructure demand grows and theres a huge burden on governments different governments are looking at how best to utilise private sector skills and financing to relieve the burden of developing infrastructure
7037278 putting together a ppp framework is more complex than you can imagine because of the sheer size and issues to consider this will take a few years to put in place
7037279 infrastructure asset class is something thats picked up over the last few years and from the experience over in the west you find that construction companies see this as a new way to get into the market
7037280 saat ini kita sudah mampu swasembada beras dan sekarang bersiap siap untuk ekspor apabila target produksi naik lima persen bisa tercapai
7037281 kalau ketiga halangan itu aman maka insyaalah kita bisa full swasembada dan tidak akan impor beras bahkan tahun depan bisa ekspor
7037282 tahun ini praktis bulog tidak impor karena persediaan beras masih mencukupi hingga enam bulan ke depan sementara sepanjang 2007 bulog masih impor beras sebanyak 7 3 juta ton
7037283 saya hanya menjawab pertanyaan yang benar benar kebijakan penting jika masalah yang ditanyakan tadi tidak penting dan bisa dijawab bukan oleh menteri
7037284 kebijakan itu diambil pemerintah karena banyaknya jumlah pemohon dan keterbatasan secara riil atas ketersediaan kanal
7037285 ke 2 167 permohonan ipp radio itu terdiri atas 109 permohonan lpp lembaga penyiaran publik 1 707 lps lembaga penyiaran swasta dan 351 lpk lembaga penyiaran komunitas sedangkan 258 permohonan ipp televisi terdiri atas 12 lpp 179 lps 13 lpk dan 54 permohonan lembaga penyiaran berbayar lpb
7037286 dengan pembedaan itu dimungkinkan dalam penyelenggaraan penyedia jaringan yang jumlahnya tidak banyak namun membutuhkan investasi yang besar akan bisa dilakukan oleh konsorsium
7037287 kami telah menyelesaikan pemetaan kanal frekuensi untuk penyelenggaraan tv siaran digital terestrial baik untuk penerimaan tv free to air maupun tv siaran digital bergerak mobile tv
7037288 di tiap wilayah layanan dijatah enam kanal yakni satu kanal dapat diisi 6 9 program siaran kami harapkan pada 2008 atau paling lambat pada 2009 era penyiaran digital di indonesia dapat dimulai
7037289 pemerintah jerman berharap bahwa rusia menarik tentara secara menyeluruh tanpa ada yang ditinggalkan sejalan dengan rencana enam butir yang ditandatangani oleh presiden rusia dmitry medvedev dan menarik kembali pasukan mereka ke garis sebelumnya sebelum permusuhan mereka pecah
7037290 belanda dan jerman itu merupakan tempat koleksi terbesar aksara batak kemudian di austria saya pernah melihat beberapa naskah baca di prancis juga ada
7037291 itu mereka beli dari penduduk karena mereka tahu yang namanya naskah itu adalah sesuatu yang berharga seperti di eropa ada tradisi naskah yang berusia ratusan tahun itu sangat berharga
7037292 naskah batak itu masih menyimpan ilmu yang tersembunyi dan belum dipelajari seperti bagaimana orang batak meresap unsur agama seperti budha dan islam tapi sayangnya kita harus ke luar negeri untuk mempelajari naskah itu
7037293 perompak menembak dari kapal kapalnya pada saat mereka berusaha mendekati kapal barang tersebut
7037294 dengan penurunan tarif interkoneksi seluler pada 2008 otomatis keuntungan yang diperoleh pun turun karena itu tidak ada jalan lain manajemen telkom mesti kerja keras melakukan inovasi meningkatkan penggunaan cdma karena untuk fixed line telepon rumah tidak banyak yang bisa diharapkan
7037295 saya tidak setuju atas kebijaka pemrintah yang menurunkan tarif telepon seluler saat ini karena operator masih harus mengeluarkan biaya yang besar untuk membangun jaringan dalam memberikan pelayanan yang optimal kepada pelanggan
7037296 apalagi sejumlah operator swasta kini terus melakukan pembangunan jaringan yang menjadikan kompetisi menjadi ketat
7037297 sebagai bumn strategis padat modal dan teknologi mesti ditempuh langkah yang tepat terutama terkait kapasitas keputusan manajemen mengendalikan telkom
7037298 penurunan laba dipicu antara lain merosotnya pendapatan dari layanan seluler anak perusahaan pt telkomsel
7037299 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7037300 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7037301 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone
7037302 we need your help to keep building this movement for change

7037305 you do not have to approve of drugs to be offended
7037306 infelizmente ele o prefeito n o se interessou o que ali s um pr tica reiterada deste governo
7037307 e il mare a trieste bello quando soffia il borino una sorpresa un colore azzurro verdeggiante il mare crudo pens il signor refossi e rimase stupito della propria idea perch crudo esiste un colore di cosa cruda la vita cruda il colore della cosa cruda molto vivo un po stridente il fuoco lo muta e lattenua quel giorno il mare stonava
7037308 anche senza totti dallinizio i giallorossi meritano rispetto ma mancini gioca con noi
7037309 e un giocatore fantastico ma se non dovesse esserci dal primo minuto le cose cambieranno poco la roma lavora da tanti anni con la stessa squadra non un dramma perdere totti anche lo scorso anno si sono adattati bene e sono rimasti in corsa per lo scudetto fino allultima giornata ha giocato molto bene lanno scorso ma nel calcio si vive di titoli se non fosse cos staremmo nel giardino a giocare con i bambini il titolo lha vinto linter anche se in coppa stata pi forte la roma oggi comunque ho detto ai miei che non la stessa squadra senza mancini
7037310 non mi preoccupa il fatto che nessuno sia andato via le carte sono tutte in tavola come nel poker tutti sanno gli spazi che avranno a disposizione certo mi piacerebbe che alcuni potessero scegliere una strada diversa specie per chi sa che rester fuori dalla lista champions o avr poco spazio in questi casi restare qui una loro scelta nessuno si potr lamentare del fatto di giocare poco se tutti decidono di restare per me non un problema sono professionisti che lavorano molto bene sono opzioni in pi magari ultime opzioni ma io rispetto i contratti tra i giocatori e il mio club
7037311 la porta aperta in entrambe le direzioni per unaltra settimana noi abbiamo lavorato in precampionato per giocare con due ali come figo e mancini ma se abbiamo bisogno di cambiare modulo possiamo farlo come contro lajax ho tante opzioni non vivo con la pressione di sapere qualcosa dal mercato sono soddisfatto della squadra attuale
7037312 e la vita non puoi sapere cosa ti accadr domani magari tra quattro anni far fatica a trovare una squadra
7037313 penso che il chelsea debba mettere in vendita il dvd della partita proprio come aveva fatto dopo chelsea barcellona 4 2 che era andato a ruba
7037314 la cosa positiva che adesso posso andare a londra tranquillamente potr camminare senza essere travolto dallaffetto dei tifosi
7037315 costs look pretty good compared to natural gas power public policy climate concern and new technology are driving it too
7037316 its inhuman the players cant breathe and its difficult to run the heat is unbearable
7037317 it actually affected both countries and most players did not play to their best abilities because of the heat
7037318 although we dont make the rules and we were told to play i dont think it was a good idea to play at noon
7037319 it was very hard to play we were tired and it was very hot but the energy we had came from knowing that we were playing in the final
7037320 with the temperature being very high it was agreed with the teams and their medical staff that there would be two breaks during the game to allow the players to drink at 30 and 70 minutes
7037321 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
7037322 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done we have our team but we also have our work cut out for us
7037323 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7037324 estou vendo a candidatura dele perder voto nas pesquisas porque eu acho a candidatura dele incoerente uma candidatura de algu m que est no nosso governo seu partido do nosso governo
7037325 n o agora em um governo seu e que vai bem
7037326 the temptation to drink is with me forever when youve done something a certain way for so long doing it a different way is difficult you start to doubt yourself ill never be cured its one of those things that ill have to deal with all my life
7037327 they like him they want to give him a chance but its a big big job they need some reassurances that hes up to it
7037328 hes not one whos going to shoot from the hip
7037329 i think the personal character is more important than the experience
7037330 its a very complicated job with a lot of pieces that are constantly moving on you
7037331 if the campaign is disorganized and the candidate is disorganized that might be an indication they cant put a white house together
7037332 his experience is certainly not something you would look at and say this is who i want to be leader of the free world
7037333 entendemos que unos d as antes se ten a que haber hecho la renovaci n

7037335 f r das dritte und alle folgenden kinder ist das kindergeld seit 1995 nicht mehr erh ht worden hier gibt es erheblichen nachholbedarf
7037336 das wird auf hohe zustimmung bei den jungen v tern treffen und die wirtschaft wird das elterngeld genauso gut akzeptieren wie bisher
7037337 then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
7037338 one is in very close danger of punishing a child for coming from a good home or going to a good school
7037339 there would be uproar if we tried to take into account this data when selecting our olympic team we dont seem to be able to recognise talent and develop talent as we do in the sporting arena
7037340 the lower the average performance of the school the more weight may be given to the candidate whose past examination performance significantly exceeds their schools average performance
7037341 admissions tutors have discretion to make conditional offers which differ from the typical entry requirement if in their judgement the typical entry requirement would not be appropriate because of the particular circumstances of an applicant
7037342 one of whom is predicted to achieve aab at a level while the other is heading for aaa
7037343 the first attends a school that is dealing with many educational challenges and where aab is exceptional
7037344 the second attends a school where aaa is not unusual he or she has an uninspiring reference and a lacklustre personal statement we think that offering a place to the first candidate rather than the second is both fair and in tune with our desire to recruit the students with the strongest academic qualities
7037345 admission is based on academic merit the college will not lower its admission standards as a means of widening access
7037346 the provision of infertility treatment has not been seen as a traditional nhs service and therefore is often viewed as a relatively low priority compared to more visible conditions whose impact is well established
7037347 the groups final report will seek to consider the often unseen consequences of infertility including the impact on mental health and general wellbeing which may draw on other nhs services for treatment as well as the positive benefits of ivf
7037348 lack of knowledge and understanding of infertility and its treatment
7037349 it is appropriate for ivf to be considered carefully for inclusion on the national tariff
7037350 clinicians and practitioners involved in infertility services are all aware that we are not just dealing with a physical pathology
7037351 infertility is a disease but it also has fallout beyond that for a significant proportion of couples causing mental health problems depression stress related illnesses and so on
7037352 it is a tremendous step forward that a region has seen the value of doing this and i would hope that others will do the same but there is certainly a view in the sector that central funding would solve an awful lot of problems
7037353 the mhra is aware of the issue any regulatory action that may be necessary to minimise harm to patients will be taken once the new information has been carefully reviewed
7037354 based on the information presented by the study investigator and the analyses conducted independently by the university of oxford clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit msp believes the cancer finding is likely to be an anomaly that taken in the light of all the available data does not support an association with vytorin also known as inegy
7037355 we are committed to working with regulatory agencies to further evaluate the available data and interpretations of those data we do not believe that changes in the clinical use of vytorin are warranted of course patients taking vytorin should talk to their doctor if they have questions
7037356 no englishman can open his mouth without causing another englishman to despise him
7037357 this house will in no circumstances fight for king and country
7037358 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
7037359 em meu zelo para reacender o idealismo eu cometi alguns erros
7037360 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7037361 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints is developing a new version of the familysearch org web site this new web site will help individuals identify ancestors and link them to families and it will help church members perform temple ordinances for their ancestors
7037362 can you volunteer an hour of time to help evaluate this new web site

7037364 thank you for your interest and enthusiasm we greatly value your time and opinion
7037365 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7037366 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7037367 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7037368 this is probably one of my worst races this year and just compound that with the fact that these are the olympics and these are all the best riders in the world all trying to do their best for today and its a tough course and it was hot
7037369 so a lot of little things kind of led to my withdrawal
7037370 i knew right away i wasnt good and i was hoping that i would kind of ride through it and the legs would start to come around later on but it just didnt happen
7037371 sometimes you have good legs and youre good that day and other days you dont have it and when you dont have it its hard to really do anything differently when youre going as hard as you can and youre in the lead its a lot easier mentally than when youre struggling back in the 20s or 30s
7037372 the climbs may be short only one or two minutes but then you only descend for 10 or 15 seconds and then youre climbing again so it kind of feels like one big climb out there
7037373 some courses kind of flow where you get into a good rhythm like in any sport and this course you come to pretty much a stop and then you start up a hill again

7037379 the biggest idol today is the concept of nation state which in fact is the coffin of religion
7037380 faint not nor grieve for ye will overcome them if ye are indeed believers
7037381 fain would they put out the light of allah with their mouths but allah will perfect his light however much the disbelievers are averse it is he who hath sent his messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that he may make it conqueror of all religion however much idolaters may be averse
7037382 for ordinary pakistanis the political squabbling is growing unbearable as the sinking economy makes it harder to feed their families or fill up their gas tanks
7037383 the first problem they should take care of is inflation
7037384 then well see about the judges what are the judges going to do for us will they bring down the prices will they come deliver flour at our homes
7037385 all the political leaders are playing games with each other
7037386 our pakistan is going down just because of our leaders they are selfish

7037396 mi opini n es que las zonas de seguridad van contra el esp ritu del acuerdo de alto el fuego

7037416 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
7037417 trying to breach the wall of silence surrounding gaza is the best way to show that when a problem is hidden it doesnt exist
7037418 i created this basically to reach out for those individuals who still dont know that there is such an amazing beauty product as effective and as affordable as this that exists

7037420 our policy is to encourage the chinese government to respect free expression and freedom of religion which are protected by law
7037421 when it comes to media freedom during the olympics china is not even on the awards podium
7037422 china is trying to show the world this face that they are a modern progressive country but that really isnt the truth
7037423 the real face is one that denies freedom of expression and that denies it brutally and violently when it can

7037469 sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7037470 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion
7037471 senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters

7037502 sort of psst shes married to a rockefeller its like saying you went to harvard it opens doors

7037519 i could be wrong but i think management is far more focused on fixing the business rather than selling the company
7037520 we are making changes to deliver consistent and expanding profitability
7037521 although the last two quarters were tough for sun we continue to see great progress

7037524 there is no doubt that the companys technology talent customer base and brand still command respect in the industry

7037676 i was a 42 year old guy who never really when i started off intended to really run quite frankly i thought more about how to win than how to govern i wasnt nearly as sure as what i wanted to do if i were able to govern today it is almost the opposite unfortunately
7037677 this time rightly or wrongly i am given a fair amount of credit by serious press guys for being ready to be president but theres grave doubt whether i can get the nomination to run for president so its kind of a flip do you know what i mean
7037678 its sort of been liberating i dont feel constrained in this campaign i dont parse my words i dont look at the polls im going to win or lose on my own terms one of the things that last time taught me was the worst way to lose was on somebody elses terms

7037687 is how do i survive this i think you are blinded by your despair its kind of like youre getting sucked inside yourself into a black hole except what you really need sometimes you just need to know someone else made it
7037688 i didnt know them i had never met them in my life
7037689 but you know when you have sort of a gift the gift is you survived you know if you give that to somebody it makes you feel worthwhile because people did it for me

7037692 one time in portugal when i lost a match against spain people waved the white handkerchiefs afterwards they said they wanted me out
7037693 they booed me many times as portugal manager and players sometimes what i try to do is give confidence to the player because people sometimes do not understand what is happening with the whole team
7037694 its not one player that makes a team it is 11 i think england have very good players and lampard is one of these players

7037707 it will consider the results of the olympics and paralympics as well as other achievements in the wider sporting world over the past year
7037708 i think the olympics in 2012 will be spectacular they will be different from beijing
7037709 i think there is more emphasis on our creativity of the sporting legacy that is left after the olympics and on fun
7037710 i think music and the cultural aspects of the games will be very important as we move forward to 2012
7037711 in all these areas where our creativity is leading the world l think we will want to showcase that to the world when they look in on london in 2012

7037791 they talk about paying them 10 an hour thats true how can you live a middle class life on that
7037792 every political scorecard has its problems and this one is no exception the selection of bills is subjective chosen after conversations with capitol staff and experts and our own observations of big debates over the last two years under the dome the bills we chose were not necessarily the most publicized or even the most hotly contested in all cases but we sought to pick a variety of bills dealing with diverse topics that lawmakers have been asked to tackle over the last legislative session part of the problem with this particular scorecard is the fact that both legislative houses and all legislative committees are controlled by democrats as such the controversial bills that do find their way to the floor are disproportionately democrat sponsored bills
7037793 also our scorecard reflects what most capitol observers know to be true that democrats from the central valley tend to be more moderate than their caucus colleagues while republicans in contested districts like abel maldonado and greg aghazarian earn more centrist marks than those lawmakers in more solid partisan districts
7037794 state sen mike machado d linden had the second lowest score of any democrat and he is termed out of the 5th senate district seat another target of both parties this fall the two candidates for that seat aghazarian and termed out assemblywoman lois wolk d davis are both ranked as relative moderates
7037795 assemblyman greg aghazarian continues to turn in strong fundraising numbers including raising over 565 000 in the latest period ending june 30th aghazarians fundraising topped that of his opponent lois wolk by a nearly seven to one margin wolk raised just over 76 000 for the period current cash on hand for aghazarian is 1 040 000 over fives time more than wolks 185 000
7037796 greg aghazarian has built a strong reputation in the valley as a balanced can do legislator who is willing to do what is right even if it means going against the party line voters want to see him continue representing them in the state senate and thats one reason why the outpouring of support has been so strong gregs broad base of support is a sharp contrast to that of lois wolk who continues to struggle in her fundraising
7037797 parents often place the burden on teachers for shouldering every bit of responsibility for the education of their children in reality educational success of our nations youth requires a serious team effort beyond the bi annual parent teacher conference teachers cannot succeed without consistent parental involvement in the education process if the parent isnt connected to their own childs education they are not preparing a child to be successful period

7037799 i think the doctors pretty much know how to estimate the damage there off the bat when its as bad as it apparently is

7037802 not many people get to go out on their own terms in this sport and that would be very sad for him if he missed a big farewell

7037815 im proud of myself today because of the stress and the pressure ive been dealing with the past 24 hours
7037816 and theres been a lot of doubt in my mind just the kind of thing ive never dealt with before
7037817 its crappy to have your worst day on the biggest day
7037818 i wrote down things that i wanted to be today in the morning
7037819 i dont write very much but after i got out of bed i wrote things i wanted to be
7037820 and i said i wanted to be strong and confident triumphant and the last one was adam try to be myself because i wasnt yesterday and you know i got a little bit of it back
7037821 i felt good the first half but the last half was just a huge struggle i didnt have that usual pop that i do
7037822 at the 200 metre mark i went for it marnie mcbean the great canadian rower told me to fight like a tiger i tried to it was really tough
7037823 and thats when kenny ken wallace of australia who won gold passed me
7037824 i picked it up being toast and i was as strong as i could be today
7037825 but in hindsight i wouldnt have changed it because thats how i think i can beat tim on a good day
7037826 but i didnt have it when i needed it and thats just life thats just sports a lot of people yesterday said that thats just sports adam and its true i supposedly love sports im supposed to love that
7037827 thats my explanation for yesterday the 1 000 and i cant go any deeper than that
7037828 the amount of pressure ive been dealing with the last six months just the mounting pressure of being a potential double gold medalist
7037829 knowing that ive won a lot of races up until now
7037830 but they dont really matter once you get here because its this one that counts
7037831 youll wait 4 months then have to start over and find something else

7037847 masih banyak perempuan yang takut dianggap tidak suci karena sudah tidak perawan padahal robeknya selaput dara tidak selalu karena hubungan seks bisa saja karena perkosaan atau trauma akibat jatuh atau kecelakaan
7037848 selaput dara itu bukan seperti beduk yang akan pecah bila ditusuk bentuknya bisa halus seperti renda atau seperti cincin dan baru benar benar robek bila seseorang sudah melahirkan bayi secara normal
7037849 menurut saya itu adalah penipuan buat apa hymen dibuat utuh padahal sebenarnya ia sudah melakukan hubungan

7037876 you realize were at the age where were considered creepy by women right
7037877 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
7037878 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
7037879 i had a baby about 12 weeks ago that gave me a bit of a break from work and a lot of hard training it was a bit of a change in lifestyle

7037893 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7037894 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7037895 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7037896 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7037897 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7037898 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7037899 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7037900 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7037901 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7037902 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7037903 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7037904 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7037905 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write

7037912 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
7037913 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
7037914 we still have to go out there and prove ourselves we didnt do anything last year
7037915 we know what they can do theyre very high level players and should complement the guys that are already here
7037916 yeah it could have been kind of predictable last year
7037917 but hopefully ill get some change ups and weve got some new guys inside that we could definitely do more things with theres more possibilities
7037918 we dont want to get ahead of ourselves we dont want to be a team thats talking playoffs and all this and we come out and get our butts kicked its the one game at a time one week at a time approach
7037919 of course we have goals we want to win our division we want to go to the playoffs everybody knows that but were not going to be talking about all that stuff our goal is to beat dallas on sept 7 right now thats it
7037920 i think you could see coming in on the bus before the galway quarter final we saw croke park in the distance and it got the blood going
7037921 i dont know if its worth a couple of points but it get the blood going fellas really look forward to it its every footballers dream to play there
7037922 i think concentration focusing properly fellas might have taken their eye off the ball a small bit
7037923 i wouldnt say we were looking to the future or the quarter finals but fellas maybe werent thinking of the significance of cork it wasnt just one or two people it was one to 30 and possibly some of the management
7037924 we all have to hold our hands up and take the blame having the back door shouldnt be an excuse for the simple fact that youre playing cork in a munster final

7037937 time warner has already had more than 18 months to decide to offer the big ten network to its customers and in a statement wednesday said we are ready to carry the network
7037938 fine then they should carry the network and at terms comparable to the networks other agreements or they should tell their customers they have decided not to either way buckeye fans deserve to know the truth
7037939 oh he he wasnt hurt as badly as we were led to believe

7037945 he aziz was brought dead we couldnt conduct any post mortem because the body was soon taken by an angry mob for funeral
7037946 pierced through azizs body and even forensic experts cannot say what kind of bullet hit him
7037947 the bullet had entered the left side of his back and left from the right side
7037948 we have just lodged firs first information reports and detailed investigations would be launched soon
7037949 pakistan backed separatists have been using the tool of political killing to stoke anti india passions in the valley but i am not sure if azizs death falls in that category
7037950 nobody is going to believe this narayanans theory he was killed in police and paramilitary firing and i am an eyewitness to that

7037968 see slide 40 i heartily agree in this sense i think for programmers who have good discipline test first might well be a good tool but test later is just as good a tool and perhaps a better one
7037969 discovery of issue to fix that works running in production
7037970 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7037971 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7037972 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7037973 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7037974 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7037975 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7037976 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7037977 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7037978 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7037979 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7037980 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7037981 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7037982 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7037983 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7037984 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7037985 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7037986 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7037987 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7037988 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7037989 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7037990 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7037991 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7037992 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7037993 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7037994 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7037995 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7037996 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7037997 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7037998 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7037999 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7038000 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7038001 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7038002 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7038003 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7038004 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7038005 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7038006 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7038007 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7038008 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7038009 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7038010 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7038011 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7038012 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7038013 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7038014 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7038015 who are open to doing something on the production side
7038016 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7038017 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7038018 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7038019 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7038020 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7038021 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7038022 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7038023 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7038024 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7038025 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7038026 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7038027 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7038028 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7038029 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7038030 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7038031 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7038032 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7038033 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7038034 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7038035 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7038036 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7038037 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7038038 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7038039 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7038040 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7038041 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7038042 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7038043 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7038044 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7038045 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7038046 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7038047 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7038048 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7038049 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7038050 new york hows this sound 30 to 40 real world miles per gallon modest price fun to drive distinctive looking that sums up the redesigned 2009 honda fit on sale next week think honda will have trouble selling the 85 000 a year it plans to get from japan the fits not a hybrid which is the first question people asked at rest stops but its window sticker prices of 15 000 to 19 000 make it thousands of dollars cheaper than hybrids unless dealers start marking up fits prices just because they can in this climate of fuel price hysteria
7038051 ann arbor mi last week we had the opportunity to check out hondas all new 2009 us market fit with more power a substantially stiffer body structure and a real vtec engine the new fit is even more fun to drive though the fit has only been offered in the usa since the 2007 model year the same essential vehicle has been on sale in other markets since 2001 so its no surprise that this new model represents a giant leap forward in almost every way considering the fact that the old fit was already considered the benchmark amongst much newer competitors this all new fit should have executives at toyota and nissan sweating bullets

7038067 i was returning home on a sunday night june 29 after visiting some friends and was buzzing my gate when a car pulled up behind me armed suspects approached my bentley and put a gun to my head i was pulled out of the car and forced to lie on the ground where i was searched
7038068 they didnt want the car all they were interested in was my watch and personal belongings like my wallet
7038069 a few of my mates who live in houghton illovo and inanda have been targeted by this slick gang they just want the watches and remarkably not the cars

7038078 esperamos que se juzgue una l gica la l gica croma n donde se privilegia el negocio por sobre la vida y se cuida m s la propiedad que a las personas
7038079 este es un juicio incompleto nunca va a estar lo suficientemente completo porque el primero que deber a estar an bal ibarra fue sobrese do por razones pol ticas y porque la corporaci n judicial o al menos una parte sigui protegi ndolo
7038080 lo fundamental para nosotros son los funcionarios acusados que son los que permitieron a todos los dem s hacer lo que hicieron un escaloncito debajo est n los polic as y luego el grupo chab n y villarreal
7038081 para nosotros lo central es que se entienda que hay una consigna en las marchas que es literalmente cierta a los pibes no los mat ni la bengala ni el rock los mat la corrupci n el lucro desmedido es corrupci n el sistema que participa de esas ganancias es corrupci n y la coima directa es corrupci n directa
7038082 estuvimos con el fiscal y de pronto nos dice parece que para ustedes fuera m s importante ibarra que chab n ni lo hab amos hablado entre nosotros pero le dijimos que por supuesto porque chab n es un empresario uno puede querer que hubiera otra clase de empresarios pero ibarra era el estado entonces o cuid s a la gente o no me vendas que lo vas a hacer no es que no queremos condena para chab n sino que no somos tontos no queremos que le den 50 a os a chab n y que los funcionarios queden exonerados eso ser a una mentira
7038083 ella por su manejo con los negocios de la noche y hay gente que est procesada y espera el 2 juicio oral como juan carlos l pez ex secretario de seguridad o rafael levy
7038084 nosotros tomamos esto como el primer cap tulo de una novela larga pero existe una corporaci n judicial que pretende que sea el ltimo cap tulo
7038085 croma n es un mal ejemplo que se puede expandir hay una corporaci n judicial e incluyo en lo que digo a la corte suprema que tiene una concepci n aristocr tica del poder judicial ellos son los cortesanos y el pueblo son los s bditos pero resulta que los s bditos andan medio subversivos y hay que cuidarse de ellos que somos todos nosotros

7038097 how is so much stuff gathered every two weeks for an auction
7038098 we even have had people come to just buy lunch
7038099 i had a guy from a national newspaper track me down and say have you got any comment to make all of your new album has come up on the internet and i was going its impossible its ludicrous because only four or five people had copies so i said read out the song titles that are up on the internet and he read out the track listing from the last album so i was like thats on the internet is it its also in hmv in the o section you idiot
7038100 if its out there and you can get it you know go ahead im certainly not going to get into mode about this
7038101 its well documented i dont even have a computer and i dont get involved in that type of gear
7038102 if people are willing to have faceless cds like that in their collection good for them it would be absolutely ludicrous for a rock star to demand that people pay money for albums because the kids havent got that much money to pay for an album so if they can find it for free go ahead but dont do it on oasis records though because thats against the law
7038103 pinch as many pigeon detectives but dont nick any oasis
7038104 i think what comcast and time warner cable are doing is a great first step
7038105 it gets isps out of the business of deciding which applications are important and which arent but there are enhancements to the peer to peer protocol in particular that can make it easier on all isps
7038106 this is a step in the right direction because isps are indeed making their networks more
7038107 but make no mistake bandwidth caps and metered plans are bad for the internet and could stunt the adoption and growth of all broadband services
7038108 if it does then something has gone wrong with competition customers clearly dont want metered plans and bandwidth caps there might be some isps that experiment with these but i dont see it happening
7038109 the text in the article was from the official comment that i received from davenports pr company bell here it is
7038110 the decree can be defined as original or creative at best
7038111 even the judge who issued the decree states that no infringing material is hosted on the pirate bay which provides just a tracker search engine
7038112 the judge tries to create a sort of contributory infringement accusation against the pirate bay
7038113 we will bring all our arguments before the tribunal and we are confident of the tribunals decision
7038114 it is clear that this decree has been strongly backed up by fimi the italian ifpi

7038117 we are also gravely concerned about the upcoming closing ceremony on august 24 as it is entirely predictable that illegal copies of that event will be immediately made available through the pirate bay
7038118 i think its good that ioc understands that they will get nowhere with sending a legal threat to us it shows theyre smart and without manners
7038119 we were going to ignore the olympics but now were loading our cannons our weapons of mass distribution are pointed towards china
7038120 i also hope that the swedish government will report back to them and tell them to give us the gold that the ioc stole from the swedish wrestler and to tell them to not host the olympics in a country with poor respect for human rights
7038121 couldnt you just spend 30 seconds googling the name of the application
7038122 its given us a chance to re write a fantastic p2p app and make it even better
7038123 which is a perfect example of the file sharing hydra in action
7038124 it works very well for today but i dont know if it will work well tomorrow or the next day or the year after i want to hear from students i think students should be engaged in this discussion and faculty too
7038125 my inspiration was youtorrent com before it sailed to clean waters
7038126 it is simple to use responsive and has loads of good results for almost any search query at that time i didnt know about other similar meta search engines so i decided id try to make one myself mostly for fun
7038127 i have not yet made a complete wish list but btmon com bitenova nl and torrentbox com will definitely be added in september
7038128 worst case scenario is that ill have to move it to a server in a less strict country
7038129 we are confident that we will have something quite good to announce in the next couple of months
7038130 i hope that people start noticing that ifpi gets more and more into bed with the police its really disturbing that one side of an ongoing fight gets more authority without a legal basis
7038131 this decision sends out a clear message that the pirate bays activities are illegal under italian law the pirate bay facilitates the mass infringement of copyright across music film television and games its very name shows the contempt its operators hold for the creators of legitimate content
7038132 we gained 10 places on alexa in italy and our own stats show a 5 increase in traffic from italy which has been quite stable before
7038133 its quite interesting and my guess with background about what happened in denmark is that the site will gain even more attention over the coming weeks in the media and also get a lot of new visitors
7038134 that means that the music industry in germany has no chance to find out the real address behind an ip address at the moment
7038135 the guidelines say that no investigation should be done if the damage is lower than 3000 euros approx 4 500
7038136 the guideline says that the damage of trading one song is 1 euro 1 50 that means that you could have 2999 files on your computer and the prosecutors will not investigate
7038137 this decision is very new we do not know what consequences it will have or if all prosecutors in germany will follow the new guidelines
7038138 we started the torrentprivacy project at the end of 2007 the idea was to give torrent users an anonymous bittorrent service from a party they can trust torrentreactor has been online for approximately 4 years and we believe that when people see that torrentprivacy uses ns1 ns2 torrentreactor net as dns servers they wont have any questions about a possible government setup of torrentprivacy com
7038139 we dont like the situation where two organizations from the usa believe they can rule the world the pirate bay showed them that other countries have other laws and american laws dont work outside of usa we want to be the pain in their asses and allow users to download what they want without fear of a sudden door knock
7038140 the vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the processing of torrent files this can be exploited to cause a stack based buffer overflow by tricking the user into opening a torrent file containing an overly long created by field

7038172 cultural and religious tolerance is part of tunisias patrimony the display of religious harmony that one witnesses on the ghriba celebrations is possible because of tunisias social history and because the changes and reforms introduced in tunisia especially during the last two decades have anchored the values of tolerance and acceptance of religious and cultural differences
7038173 europe cannot fight anti semitism if it appeases terrorists or blackens israels name we need to insist that a linkage exists between blind palestinophilia being soft on terror and jihad defaming israel and the current wave of anti semitic violence

7038189 its kind of a window into who my dad was
7038190 it shows me the determination and the heart that he had
7038191 that was where he spent the majority of his days
7038192 i am just totally blown away that these people are still committed to having this event
7038193 to me it speaks volumes about who he was and the lives he was able to touch

7038197 legalizing same sex marriage or civil unions endangers not only marriage as an institution but will endanger the civil rights
7038198 its about the right to express opposition and those who do so already suffer harassment and hostility
7038199 hate filled homophobic narrow minded and bigoted those are the labels youll get those of you who live in california put on your armor
7038200 those attacks are purely an effort to silence harass and drive out of the public square those who oppose them
7038201 thats the greatest concern i have the effort to intimidate and silence those who have different views ive had professors i greatly respect come up to me in dark hallways and tell me they agree with me but they wont stand up in a meeting and say so theyre afraid of the criticism theyll endure
7038202 those who want to promote conjugal marriage will be targeted
7038203 its not like a bone sticking out of a limb or blood spurting out of a wound it will be at least a full generation before all the consequences are known like smoking it will take years and decades to see the result
7038204 was resoundingly rejected everybody said its tough initially but it will be ok and there will be no lasting effects
7038205 yet within a decade social scientists began documenting very distinct harm to children he said
7038206 there is now a large body of irrefutable evidence of the serious harmful effects for children of divorce that have been documented
7038207 temporary for two thirds it is lifelong for about one third
7038208 will harm you and your family the same way polygamous marriage to 14 year olds will harm you it will transform the meaning expectations and practices of marriage as a social institution and affects everyone who has a stake in marriage
7038209 from taxes to torts from wills to medical treatment the laws will change and well reconceptualize our understanding that the union of two men or two women is equally important
7038210 thats 70 billion in federal costs 42 billion in state costs and it amounts to over 1 trillion per decade if you think fighting the war in iraq is expensive weve been paying those costs in this country for the past 30 years
7038211 if your tax burden is high now wait until those same sex marriages fall apart and the state has to care for
7038212 contributes much more to society than any other form of adult intimate relationship
7038213 the major transmission method for the aids virus is through sex between men in every area of the world other than sub saharan africa
7038214 based on assumptions that same sex marriage contributes as much to society as traditional marriage
7038215 not without consequences they simply assumed the absence of harm and closed their eyes to contrary evidence in fact they refused to even examine it
7038216 bold and bad political act that lacked judicial care and caution but rather opted to exercise political influence
7038217 please re adjust your thinking these issues are generational and well have to work at it for a generation or two if we do our grandchildren will reap the benefits of what were trying to do

7038225 financial firms speculating for their clients or for themselves account for about 81 percent of the oil contracts on the nymex a far bigger share than had previously been reported by the agency
7038226 financial speculation did play a significant part in the rapid increase in oil prices
7038227 these two actions in combination would provide a powerful signal to speculators and world oil markets that will help alleviate the current upward pressure on prices and help american families
7038228 if h r 6346 or any similar price control bill were presented to the president his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill
7038229 the administration is strongly opposed to h r 6604 which offers poorly targeted short term measures that do nothing to address the fundamentals of supply and demand that bear the primary responsibility for current high energy prices

7038240 the board wanted to open the door for dialogue and come to a reasonable resolution so far we havent heard back
7038241 caliente has an aggressive marketing plan that targets outside the traditional nudist clientele
7038242 this has created dissatisfaction with a minority of homeowners in the caliente community caliente intends to move forward in expanding our brand to nontraditional nudists and people who want to enjoy occasional skinny dipping in luxury both here and at our resort in the dominican republic
7038243 the resort has recently taken actions to alleviate the members concerns including withdrawing the resorts direct participation in swingfest and continuing to communicate with the property owners board about its concerns
7038244 the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to act on behalf of the homeowners association members and the board will not hesitate to do so in this regard to whatever extent is necessary including legal action for violation
7038245 its in everyones best interests for the two entities to work together

7038249 a trusted source for nudist information on such topics as what to expect at a nudist club a nudist resort or even from a skinny dipping experience
7038250 we recognize the plight of people who desire to live clothes free who when health fails are forced back into the textile world our facility will be truly nude residents staff nurses even some cooperative physicians
7038251 if its legal within the law of the state of florida and desoto county it doesnt bother me
7038252 there used to be one out in brownsville years ago
7038253 everyone knew about it we used to drive by as kids in high school but we never saw anything im not going to belong to it and im not in favor of where its going to be located but i dont care one way or the other
7038254 i knew the general direction it was in but i dont have any firsthand knowledge i drove around and passed by the place but never saw anything and i didnt see anyone that was naked either they werent there or i was in the wrong place
7038255 its not going to happen because its desoto county and too many people dont want it
7038256 in the whole realm of things between what is needed and what people want its not a need
7038257 the place would be gated but its never going to happen the commissionll never vote for it
7038258 i did find out a realtor in the last year had been making inquiries but its not a county issue at this point
7038259 family oriented resort ideally situated on 320 acres in desoto county
7038260 its a long way from this could happen to this is happening

7038263 those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
7038264 when youre naked you cant express your feelings of social superiority over others through your clothing
7038265 if youre reading this youre probably not listening to me
7038266 because it wasnt like id taken up golf and could ask them hey why dont you play a few rounds with me
7038267 you probably wont be able to get them to shut up about it
7038268 no it wasnt that we were embarrassed by our naturism we were just bored of you guys
7038269 im sure mr hamilton smith will release his costings explaining where hes taking it from
7038270 no one would make such an announcement without having done detailed costings
7038271 it would be great if it means all those sports facilities that we dont have are built
7038272 an enormous amount of facilities are lacking at that level we need facilities right through sport that would set us up for years to come santos stadium is not up to standard the track is crumbling and it does not have a warm up track which is a requirement
7038273 hockey is not up to standard because we dont have more than one pitch at the one place and even the proposed new pool at marion would have to meet fina standards
7038274 i would absolutely love a city super stadium imagine an upgrade of adelaide oval and a major indoor stadium next door
7038275 this will require a complete audit of sporting infrastructure for this state
7038276 i can see the games not being isolated to adelaide but involving regional sa with opportunities for the south east port lincoln and upper spencer gulf towns
7038277 the federal and state governments have record surpluses this can be done
7038278 adelaide oval will clearly be part of the action and a new world class sporting stadium will also be part of the action
7038279 we have options of a new city stadium close to transport or a world class revamp of west lakes but the case for a stadium in the city is compelling
7038280 as far as i am aware its the first time a prisoner and those working with him outside have been charged with drug trafficking
7038281 its also the first time a prisoners bank accounts have been frozen and their contents seized
7038282 those tempted to act as agents in this type of activity should be warned they also face such charges if they are transferring money for and on behalf of prisoners in drug transactions
7038283 the pcs is a dedicated unit that can work on one job properly
7038284 what we are doing is already having an impact on reducing drugs in prisons when they realise what we are doing they will change their tactics and we will then change our methods accordingly
7038285 weve had great success with enterprise repeats on monday night and theres an appetite for space opera as battlestar goes away
7038286 theres an opportunity to keep the space opera as part of our programming strategy
7038287 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
7038288 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
7038289 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
7038290 sg 1 ran for 10 seasons launching on showtime in 1997 and moving to sci fi after its fifth season
7038291 when michael rang me last tuesday i was on my way to new zealand
7038292 he said dad youve got to come and see me
7038293 i said to my wife maybe the doctors have told him hes only got a few weeks to live
7038294 so we cancelled everything and jumped on the plane and went to see him in melbourne and thats when he told us the story
7038295 we were just in absolute shock and we still are we havent had time to get our head around it he said i dont have cancer ive had two lives that ive lived
7038296 his wife amanda who has been with him for seven years found out the day before we did and shes had no idea
7038297 michael has had a severe addiction to pornography the addiction to pornography started when he was 12
7038298 its horrendous because we dont have that sort of stuff around he was raised in a christian home weve never brought that stuff into our home
7038299 he lived the two lives and he would get sick as a result of the guilt
7038300 he was feeling like he was letting god down letting his family down his church his friends
7038301 hes been living this for so long feeling like hes had these two lives and now hes the one thats come out in the open he confessed it he didnt get caught
7038302 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7038303 he hasnt done this for any reasons that have been portrayed that hes a fraud
7038304 it was either keep pretending or come out with the truth and tell everything hes come out with everything but now weve got the consequences of it all
7038305 we have to accept it were hoping to share with our congregation how it all started and how it got where it is
7038306 an addiction like this is not going to be fixed overnight you cant have a 16 year problem and fix it in a week
7038307 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7038308 the doctor believes that at times michael was totally convinced that he had this sickness
7038309 when he was about 12 he did vomit all the time hed get really really sick
7038310 he was in the adelaide childrens hospital for seven weeks at one stage he didnt eat and we thought we were going to lose him
7038311 they took out his appendix thinking that it might be that but they realised that it wasnt
7038312 they gave us the option of putting him in a psychiatric ward to see if there was something psychological but we felt uncomfortable with that at the time
7038313 we signed him out from hospital and then he would go a few months and then he would get sick again
7038314 wed always take him to hospital wed always do the proper thing but they couldnt get to the bottom of it until now
7038315 we have watched our son go through what we thought was cancer
7038316 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nosebleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7038317 every time we saw him we saw symptoms he stayed with us for a while where we had to put a special air conditioner in one of the rooms because he would heat up so much in the middle of winter
7038318 he had this cold air conditioner blowing on him to try to keep the heat down as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7038319 ive travelled the world asking people to pray for him can you imagine what a horrible thing it would be if i was playing a game
7038320 to be honest i ask myself as a father what did i miss what did i not do
7038321 we were definitely booked solid three months ahead we had another big party in the middle of the month and that was booked up almost to capacity
7038322 part of whats driving the business is the hellacious winter up north so many of them are from massachusetts michigan canada and they say its been horrendous
7038323 i was told new years eve was the busiest in pasco its ever been
7038324 keep in mind we added the dicks sporting goods tournament of champions the lacrosse national club championship which tallied close to 700 room nights for the county including 136 for saddlebrook resorts
7038325 we worked for many months to craft a ceremony that was very expressive of our thoughts and our beliefs
7038326 couples who get married in the nude are closer to god the universe divine energy
7038327 their emphasis is on the ceremony and the words as opposed to the flowers the place cards what kind of wine theyre serving what kind entrees desserts
7038328 my husband said it was the best 40 ever spent
7038329 nudism is a great equalizer you are the same as everyone youre not wearing anything that would separate you from anyone else
7038330 we got married this way because of our belief in having a healthy honest transparent lifestyle
7038331 god keeps sending us naked people but we keep sending him people that are all dressed
7038332 to remind my teenage sons that this is what women really look like its no good them growing up thinking we all look like those airbrushed pictures in magazines
7038333 spend any time naked in our house and youd freeze to death
7038334 i think i cover up more now that the children are teenagers
7038335 but thats more for their sake than mine i dont tend to bother about being naked in the bedroom because thats my domain
7038336 my 13 year old hates seeing me naked so i just shout no clothes on and i can hear him scuttling back down the stairs
7038337 i think nudity depends on whether your house has a lot of mirrors
7038338 i didnt mind drifting about naked in my 20s but nowadays i come across a full length mirror and think bloody hell
7038339 he keeps asking rather desperately is that appropriate because were all wandering about naked
7038340 you couldnt lock yourself away modestly in the bathroom because the rest of the family would hammer on the door shouting what are you doing in there
7038341 young children are very free and easy but most go through a modest phase after attending nursery school teenagers can find it very embarrassing if their parents are prancing about in the nude because of the whole idea of the opposite sex
7038342 whats most important is to pass on the idea that my body is ok and whatever i am is fine because the opposite message is so very harmful
7038343 those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves
7038344 i freed thousands of slaves i could have freed thousands more if they had known they were slaves
7038345 is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
7038346 a christian man is the most free lord of all and subject to none a christian man is the most dutiful servant of all and subject to every one
7038347 i wont tell a soul no one ever needs to know
7038348 the prevailing message of our time is that you can be whoever you want to be
7038349 the problem in relationships is that some partners change in ways their mates wouldnt have chosen for them they begin to form new likes and dislikes new tastes and ultimately new identities
7038350 it was so refreshing to find out how wrong i had been with my preconceived ideas on nudity and being nude with others
7038351 any guest who has a deposit holding on a reservation will be contacted soon
7038352 we want to market pasco county as a nudist destination we need to let them know what we have
7038353 weve never done anything like this at all i dont see an event here i see this as a promotional thing thats not event tied
7038354 if you have a specific event fine but just as an ongoing special event thats where we have a roadblock
7038355 they dont have an event but they do have a service which is the web site
7038356 being naked strips you of all your defences and leaves you with nothing left to hide behind
7038357 what it does is it totally disseminates you from your normal life and all the baggage that it carries
7038358 it might seem strange for us to say that we are christian but i dont see anything immoral with being in an environment like this its about feeling free and natural there is nothing sexual about it
7038359 the appeal of naturism is that it relieves you of your identity and creates instant equality
7038360 clothes are a way of defining yourself to others before they even begin speaking to you being naked like this conversing with strangers brings us all down to the same level because theres a vulnerability to it its deeply humanising
7038361 i think the world would be a much gentler place if we were all naked
7038362 its far easier to connect with another person when youre both naked because although the physical boundaries are increased the personal and emotional ones become diluted
7038363 sanfed is trying to grow naturism through events such as this one
7038364 the aim is to present naturism as something of an everyday occurrence so that people who are considering becoming a naturist can come to days like this and not feel fearful about trying it out
7038365 naturism presents them with the ultimate escape because its totally detached from ordinary life
7038366 esto es un premio para todos los que se han quedado en el camino
7038367 you do get what you pay for because you are flying there with hotel transfers sleeping in a clean room drinking yourself into a stupor should you wish to and eating until you almost explode you can do this in a high season period for less than 1 200 at a four star level with that in mind i have no complaints about the food room bar beach or service try getting all that at an auberge in qu bec for a week
7038368 when we were there earlier this year we saw three people trying to have a game of pool volleyball on the clothed side of the resort no one else was interested on the nude side we were playing with so many people that we were practically shoulder to shoulder

7038376 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
7038377 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
7038378 the auto maker believes growing demand for nicer well equipped small cars coupled with a dramatic redesign for the cruze will be enough to command sticker prices well beyond the 15 000 base price of a compact chevrolet cobalt
7038379 weve had a few people getting a bit panicky over their future reservations and were doing everything we can at this time to confirm these reservations over our personal phones

7038390 i was uncertain about the reality of eliminating my debt this way i didnt really think it could be possible so i spoke to a consultant and after they explained the process i felt very assured and was very excited to get started this is the best decision ive ever made and now im on track for a debt free christmas

7038396 the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels and constitutes one of the principal vital signs the pressure of the circulating blood decreases as blood moves through arteries arterioles capillaries and veins the term blood pressure generally refers to arterial pressure i e the pressure in the larger arteries arteries being the blood vessels which take blood away from the heart
7038397 stress can cause hypertension through repeated blood pressure elevations as well as by stimulation of the nervous system to produce large amounts of vasoconstricting hormones that increase blood pressure
7038398 women have a lot to offer and if they do well at their job theyll succeed
7038399 it wasnt that long ago when women didnt even have the right to vote and now we have women who are general officers in the army i remember when i thought seeing a female lieutenant colonel was a big deal
7038400 i think the suffrage movement effectively changed the way americans look at the role of women in society and has continued to be a pathway for us to have more opportunities
7038401 are we alone to ask and take the utmost that our women can give service and sacrifice of every kind and still say we do not see what title that gives them to stand by our sides in the guidance of the affairs of their nations and ours
7038402 we have made partners of the women in this war shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right
7038403 the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on the account of sex
7038404 the army teaches values and if you practice those values you develop strength
7038405 the woman suffrage movement has made it possible for us to utilize that strength and continue to do better in our careers as well as our lives
7038406 the german government expects that russia complete the withdrawal without delay in line with the six point plan signed by russian president dmitry medvedev and pulls back its troops to the lines before the outbreak of hostilities

7038413 i call upon all parties to the conflict in somalia to respect international human rights and humanitarian law and to stand by their commitments under the djibouti agreement
7038414 i had let my boyfriend know he was doing very very badly at the hospital and jokingly i said that he had passed away and he took upon himself to put the obituary in
7038415 upon arrival they were told the suspect just went out the backdoor in fact he was getting into a vehicle carrying a bag of money with him
7038416 as he was running the bag had a hole in it so there was money going everywhere in the neighborhood as he was running
7038417 the hamster had been posted in a sealed addressed envelope which contained no food and no source of fluid
7038418 the postman who emptied the box made the discovery because it was trying to chew its way out of the envelope a veterinary surgeon who examined the hamster said had it ended up in the sorting office and its mechanical sorting drum the creature could have been killed
7038419 to personally review and sign all checks pertaining to town of amherst business
7038420 i am sure you understand the critical importance of the chief fiscal officer taking an active role in managing town finances
7038421 i dont have a problem if he wants to sign all those checks if he thinks thats an effective utilization of his time thats up to him
7038422 but theres a detailed report issued to every department that details every employees pay line by line
7038423 if dr mohan wanted to find and check he could have checked and audited it that way with no disruption to employees
7038424 it took him over 12 hours because he had to hop through boulders and sand
7038425 the dispatcher got on the intercom and said you know what
7038426 she didnt seem like she was really under the influence of drugs or alcohol she understood what was going on and articulated herself well
7038427 and has arrested people for trying to buy drugs at a house as it was being searched by police
7038428 he had literally punched holes in the sheetrock walls of his house and stuffed the bottles in there but he had also punched holes in the bottom portion of the walls and stuffed them with newspaper
7038429 we didnt ask god to be born and i think we should have some right to decide when we want to leave
7038430 it is not a difficult matter to keep a home free of non domesticated and non house trained animals
7038431 it does not require even an ordinary level of intelligence to know that the waste products of a variety of animals many of which were in poor and diseased condition are dangerous to the well being of children and adults
7038432 the display of pornography on the walls of a home in which young children one of them a pre teen girl reside shows a callousness to their welfare that fails to meet any rational standard of behavior
7038433 the thief answered the phone but then just put it away without turning it off

7038436 theres a line smart politicians dont cross somewhere between im qualified to be president and im born to be president
7038437 wherever it lies barack obama better watch his step hes bordering on arrogance
7038438 a word to the black man do not point your nose too high do not swell your chest too much do not boast too loudly let not your ambition be inordinate or take a wrong direction
7038439 and i think there are some whites who are probably not ready to vote for an african american candidate
7038440 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position
7038441 welcome to the murky world of modern racism where most of the open animus has been replaced by a shadowy bias that is difficult to measure
7038442 going into the fight for the sole purpose of proving that a white man is better than a negro
7038443 at ringside a band played a popular song all coons look alike to me while promoters led the mostly white crowd in chants of kill the nigger
7038444 the taliban will probably develop like the saudis there will be aramco the oil consortium pipelines an emir no parliament and lots of sharia law we can live with that
7038445 either you accept our offer of a carpet of gold or we bury you under a carpet of bombs
7038446 to construct an army able to suppress its own population but incapable of defending the nation from outside powers a civil administration with no control over planning or social infrastructure which is in the hands of western ngos and a government whose foreign policy marches in step with washingtons
7038447 our movement has been too silent on afghanistan and ufpj must take leadership to expose the horrors and costs of this engagement
7038448 should the peace movement support u s military forces in a policing role rather than counter insurgency role
7038449 was a military invasion of afghanistan an appropriate reaction to the september 11 attacks
7038450 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historical facts and personages occur as it were twice he has forgotten to add the first time as tragedy the second as farce

7038452 it gives us immense pleasure to present volvo s80 to abhinav as he has done the country proud by winning a gold medal at beijing olympics we are hopeful that he will get the same pleasure from driving volvo as he gets from shooting

7038454 in addition to our dealers in delhi mumbai and chandigarh we will soon have our dealers in hyderabad bangalore cochin and pune our target is to sell 400 500 cars by the end of this fiscal
7038455 i introduced this measure with the aim of preventing another catastrophic fish kill like the one that took place on prospect island last year to protect our states declining fisheries and the commercial and sport fishing industries those fisheries support said wolk d davis todays vote takes us a step closer to that goal discussion on this issue and the broader effort to save the delta and its fisheries continues to move forward i hope that the fishing community will continue to actively participate in the conversation and thank them for their support in this effort
7038456 we need to do everything we can in the future to pass a bill that will hold the water contractors and agencies accountable for the damages theyve caused to our fisheries
7038457 the state and federal agencies are responsible for restoring delta fisheries and the ecosystem for too long fishermen and others have been disenfranchised by the agencies that are supposed to uphold the public trust
7038458 as long as theres haint too much arm wavin dancin around and carryin on
7038459 our students need the bible more than most and we aint no longer playin second fiddle to no one our football team has got god on our side and arkansas will never beat us again

7038465 our tax spoungin government teachers may not know how to preach the bible but they can learn
7038466 but as good texans we remain open to all faiths as long as theyre christian
7038467 the book you are about to read deals with what i believe to be the most serious crime ever committed in american history the president of the nation george w bush knowingly and deliberately taking this country to war in iraq under false presences a war that condemned over 100 000 human beings including 4 000 american soldiers to horrific violent deaths
7038468 see whats in front of me completely uninfluenced by the clothing reputation hoopla conventional wisdom etc put on it by others
7038469 threaten ed the world with horrible poisons and diseases and gasses and atomic weapons
7038470 exploring ways of using these to target the united states
7038471 iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the u s homeland if baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable or possibly for revenge such attacks more likely with biological than chemical agents probably would be carried out by special forces or intelligence operatives
7038472 not your war or my war or americas war but george bushs war
7038473 i have condemned russian aggression and today i reiterate my demand that russia abide by the cease fire
7038474 as careful in getting out of georgia as we were careless in getting in
7038475 underscore his support for democracy historic reform and peaceful conflict resolution
7038476 in the south caucasus u s and european state interests are bound up with the commercial interests of major oil companies that form the principal caspian energy consortia
7038477 to secure their investments in the caspian sea basin these companies have found allies among u s geostrategists who support a strong u s presence among russias neighbors high level former officials such as zbigniew brzezinski brent scowcroft john sununu james baker and richard cheney when he was head of halliburton have all visited baku azerbaijan and the caspian region and lobbied in favor of the oil companies
7038478 for an organization that has come to rely heavily on words and symbolism nato issued a disconcertingly evasive communiqu at its emergency meeting on georgia
7038479 the first mention of russia appears only in the second paragraph and it is a positive mention nato welcomes the armistice agreement reached and signed by georgia and russia no reference to the russian military duress under which this flawed armistice was reached the communiqu urges prompt good faith implementation of the armistice politely ignoring its loopholes
7038480 possess the skills resources and focused time that enables them to impose their will on a society the vast majority of whose members are overburdened and distracted by the demands of day to day survival
7038481 single sustainable model of for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise
7038482 the freedoms dangled before the unfree are in reality disguised power
7038483 when the nss document presents the free market as one of the three components of the ideal political system
7038484 the market is a surrogate a stand in for globalization empire
7038485 is taboo in u s political debate no major politician or party has so much as publicly remarked on the existence of an american empire
7038486 relies more on private media than on public agencies to disseminate propaganda reinforcing the official version of events
7038487 the democrats politics might be described as inauthentic opposition in the era of superpower having fended off its reformist elements and disclaimed the label of liberal the democratic party is trapped by new rules of the game which dictate that a party exists to win elections rather than to promote a vision of the good society accordingly the party competes for an apolitical segment of the electorate the undecided and puzzles how best to woo religious zealots should democrats somehow be elected corporate sponsors make it politically impossible for the new officeholders to alter significantly the direction of society at best democrats might repair some of the damage done to environmental safeguards or to medicare without substantially reversing the drift rightwards by offering palliatives a democratic administration contributes to plausible denial about the true nature of the system by fostering an illusion among the powerless classes that the party can make their interests a priority it pacifies and thereby defines the style of an opposition part in an inverted totalitarian system in the process it demonstrates the superior cost effectiveness of inverted totalitarianism over the crude classic versions
7038488 politics are the shadow cast on society by big business
7038489 the range of vision embraced by the primary contestants in the major u s parties has always been bounded by the horizons of property and enterprise they have accepted the economic virtues of capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man that culture has been intensely nationalistic
7038490 if political preferences are simply plugged into the system by leaders business or other in order to extract what they want from the system then the model of plebiscitary democracy is substantially equivalent to the model of totalitarian rule
7038491 america the greatest democracy that money can and did buy
7038492 guided one at its worst it is a corrupt farce amounting to manipulation with the larger population projects of propaganda in a controlled and trivialized electoral process it is an illusion
7038493 that real change can ever come from electing a different ruling class sponsored candidate
7038494 the truth is that in obama a worried establishment has found the vessel through which they hope to restore international and domestic stability
7038495 obama like carter can be useful to the u s power elite in calming things down and re establishing confidence in the legitimacy of the current political order in short he can reinforce the argument that the system still works
7038496 dmis first annual survey on the middle class and public policy

7038556 we have exchanged constructive views with each other and will meet again
7038557 we are going ahead with our indefinite agitation and we are strengthening it further
7038558 we are making 21 camps around the factory site for this indefinite agitation
7038559 amar singh from samajwadi party social activists medha patkar and kuldip nayar are also joining us
7038560 we want a peaceful agitation but if something goes out of gear its the state governments responsibility
7038561 if they at all indulge in any violence we have the right to protect ourselves too
7038562 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7038563 we met a lot of individual delegates of nsg member countries and had an opportunity to brief them on thursday
7038564 is a necessary step for cooperation between india and the nsg

7038571 if we do what bravo is doing what makes us different from bravo
7038572 what higher moral ground can we claim if we do the same thing that he doing
7038573 the repercussions on the relations between people in the area may be irreversible it may slide into a conflict we could never recover from because people will start hating each other not because they are part of the milf or part of the government but because of what they believe in
7038574 they milf can do several things to stop the offensives number one they can surrender their commanders number two they can promise to rein in their people to make sure that they cannot do criminal activities or atrocities
7038575 if they continue to harbor criminals the operations will continue we will place them under the rule of law if they refuse to surrender these commanders this means that they are tolerating them
7038576 definitely with our troops on the ground we expect more skirmishes
7038577 considering that they milf are still there as intelligence shows we anticipate some armed confrontations in the next few days
7038578 we do not want to give a deadline but as much as possible we do not want to prolong the fight because it is not good for the general public the shorter we can make these operations last the better
7038579 everyone is entitled to their own opinion no one is entitled to their own facts
7038580 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something im running to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things im running for president to protect our country from harm and defeat its enemies im running for president to make the government do its job not your job im not running to leave our biggest problems to an unluckier generation of leaders but to fix them now and fix them well

7038582 we avoided some bad areas like financials real estate and consumer goods in the last half of 2007 and first half of this year
7038583 but its a case of the baby being thrown out with the bath water as kirby operates well south of the problem areas
7038584 conocophillips was an important part of our three year performance as was apple
7038585 the u s economy is going through a marinating process and is not yet ready to start cooking
7038586 value stocks with stable cash flows and a potential catalyst
7038587 in light of the pullback in these stocks one of the major things we are thinking about is the likelihood that we will see a bounce out of energy and materials
7038588 we underperformed because we were overweight one of the worst performing sectors of the s amp p consumer cyclicals and underweight the best performing sector energy

7038590 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7038591 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7038592 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7038593 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7038594 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7038595 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7038596 probably the last quarter is a reflection of the year the inconsistency i suppose and losing another one when youre in front
7038597 tonight we were a fair way in front at three quarter time so its heartbreaking and the double blow that youre out of september
7038598 after tonight after 21 weeks we tend to know that our season will end next week so thats always a very hollow feeling when you get to that point
7038599 and when you are five goals in front at three quarter time and that happens i guess the feeling is a little bit more hollow
7038600 i think weve had a lot of games where weve come from behind
7038601 if we could get some score on the board we were maybe a chance to hit back quickly and we did that and with that we grew confidence and belief and we got a sniff
7038602 a large number of civilians were killed in what appeared to be indiscriminate attacks
7038603 i call upon all parties to the conflict in somalia to respect international human rights and humanitarian law and to stand by their commitments under the djibouti agreement
7038604 kismayo is relatively calm today saturday but residents in janayabdale village reported new clashes in the area
7038605 the remnants of the clan militias and some of their commanders tried to cross janayabdale where they encountered an attack from the islamists several people were injured in the clashes
7038606 there was some sporadic gunfire overnight from friday to saturday but no fighting
7038607 the major battle is over but the militiamen that were dislodged by islamists may try their luck to regain the town
7038608 we call on the united nations and the international community especially those with naval assets to take action
7038609 it appears the attacks are continuing and the pirates are looking for more ships to hijack
7038610 if they cant resolve the pollution problems they should stop or limit their production
7038611 although the olympic games will end soon the environmental challenges we face are by no means over
7038612 at this moment i can say that our talks with the governor appointed panel have been absolutely fruitful and productive

7038622 absolutely no doubt about it but the key is to stay within yourself not get too up or too down just try to take one day at a time the important thing to remember is that the olympics is not a sprint but a marathon
7038623 any medal would be exciting especially gold mongolia has never won gold
7038624 and theres only so many to win if theyre winning more someones winning less and here in beijing we didnt step it up like they did

7038661 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
7038662 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
7038663 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
7038664 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world

7038670 the strike is part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir
7038671 it is also to demand our right to self determination through a referendum

7038673 a curfew was clamped in the frontier poonch district after fresh incidents of violence and stone hurling saturday
7038674 well follow multi party competition periodic elections human rights and press freedom
7038675 the new government will follow the public private partnership model for economic development and promote industrial peace create jobs and ensure smooth supply of consumer goods
7038676 my view is that the buffer zones are against the spirit of the ceasefire agreement
7038677 why do they want to take control of poti they do not have such a right
7038678 maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here if they were our friends they would not do this
7038679 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7038680 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7038681 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7038682 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist
7038683 theyve gone all out to try and present a country thats ancient yet super modern
7038684 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7038685 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7038686 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7038687 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7038688 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7038689 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7038690 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7038691 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7038692 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7038693 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile

7038715 probably they are concerned about the reaction of those who will disagree with a memorial like this
7038716 there are 205 nocs national olympic committees participating in the olympics and there are more than a few dozen that will strongly disagree with this kind of event
7038717 this murder is the blackest event in the history of the olympics it is good to see that despite this israel continues to move forward and grow as a nation in general and in regards to its sports in particular
7038718 this is not an israeli issue this concerns the whole olympic family our sons fathers and husbands were no accidental tourists or visitors to the games they were part of it they believed in the spirit and the dreams of the olympics but they all came home in a coffin

7038749 this discovery gives immensely powerful support to the proposition that dinosaur fossils are not millions of years old at all but were mostly fossilized under catastrophic conditions a few thousand years ago at most
7038750 there were never any monks involved in the process of preserving the true texts of the bible
7038751 oh please dont tell jackieboy how to do it were up to our ears in sophomoric useless mumbo jumbo already
7038752 yes those are his drawings we all know what they look like its the fact that they are being used in the context that they are by rearanging the order that animals develop from conception and showing similarity between the species nowadays they use up close high resolution pictures but say the same thing
7038753 why would you start cutting and pasting now isnt that against your rules
7038754 how do you figure you cant prove that anything is 65 million years old none of the dating methods work you cant use the geological column because to make that work you have to use circular reasoning again a failure
7038755 we can only 100 date something and thats through history and we can only go back 4000 or so years with that
7038756 so to pull up 65 million year old dino bones and still have soft tissue in them is ludicrous
7038757 i love when evos find prehistorc fish still alive and go look theyve survived for millions of years how cold that happen
7038758 no it is not a translation of a translation it is a true and accurate translation of true and accurate

7038766 lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed
7038767 and the scribes and pharisees began to think saying who is this who speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
7038768 i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
7038769 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
7038770 the lords words to the apostle peter in matthew 16 19 as to binding and to all the disciples in 18 18 signify in the former case that the apostle by his ministry of the word of life would keep unbelievers outside the kingdom of god and admit those who believed
7038771 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
7038772 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3 000 souls

7038796 although we are hoping that people will have an afternoon of fun on the grass and have a chance to meet each other and make friends the day is not one to celebrate at all
7038797 80 years of the ban on cannabis since the dangerous drugs act through
7038798 not only has it failed to reduce the harm from cannabis misuse or illegal drug use generally it has increased it
7038799 the laws punish the very people who they are meant to protect those who use cannabis to their own benefit and do no harm to others it punishes harshly those who choose to grow their own for themselves and drives them to often unscrupulous and criminal drug dealers where contaminated cannabis is often sold alongside other drugs at high prices with all the profits going to the dealers
7038800 millions of decent uk citizens use cannabis medicinally or recreationally with no adverse effect to themselves or to society at large
7038801 their rights have been ignored by successive governments for far too long and the current incumbents are about to make matters worse by reclassifying to class b we the people need to start making a stand and making our voices heard
7038802 national green day is a fun way of showing support for cannabis legalisation the list of parks is growing quickly and can be found on our forum and web pages

7038810 they knew that their effort to arrest detain deport families and tear families apart was causing them a media nightmare a p r nightmare i am worried that they would utilize this failed attempt of having people turn themselves in to say now they have the duty to go after every one of these folks
7038811 the most effective way to restore integrity to the immigration system is to do it through the way we traditionally operate in fugitive operations at residences and in places of business
7038812 this wasnt something we had very high hopes for in terms of it being the answer to fugitive operations
7038813 ices self deport program failed because most of these workers are desperately clinging to the hope that they can stay in the united states and continue to support their loved ones
7038814 continue to do the job congress has mandated us to do
7038815 the agency has aggressively targeted fraud and improper payments in the dme program we have a history of working closely with the inspector general and will continue to do so
7038816 an unsupported extrapolation at this time because levinsons report only cited percentages
7038817 we assume that perhaps 10 percent of the dme claims could be fraudulent but thats sheer guesstimate
7038818 im willing to give cms some leeway but this is more than just leeway
7038819 its a more than 300 percent change in the error rate when you find such a big discrepancy you cant help but be mad and feel youve been misled
7038820 i want to know what happened whos responsible who will be held accountable and what the health and human services secretary will do about it if people cooked the books manipulated the methodology or told the contractor to ignore the rules those individuals need to take the heat
7038821 inadequate review of available documentation and to cmss lack of written policies and procedures
7038822 all hes done now is piss off the morning papers by making them miss their deadline and given the networks a scramble for saturday morning how very throwback to think you could avoid the internet attention

7038830 political leaders seem intent on suppressing and ignoring the strong evidence that biofuels are a major factor in recent food price rises
7038831 it is imperative that we have the full picture while politicians concentrate on keeping industry lobbies happy people in poor countries cannot afford enough to eat
7038832 rapid income growth in developing countries has not led to large increases in global grain consumption and was not a major factor responsible for the large price increases
7038833 hey how are ya listen ive been following your for a while now and really really like how you think and carry yourself can you do me a big favor and run for president seriously we need you please

7038842 this man told me i will never publish you and hung up the phone
7038843 i had the most miserable birthday feeling id never make it in literature id given it everything
7038844 met a critical need for books to address sensitive issues in egyptian society political corruption and social oppression head on there was a sigh of relief in the arab world at last a book that calls a spade a spade
7038845 success can be dangerous you get isolated but if you block your contact with the street youre in trouble more than 60 of egyptians are below the poverty line i must keep loyal to them or ill lose everything
7038846 i felt i had so much power they were obliged to hear my ideas but they couldnt tolerate my presence
7038847 does not change the situation for democracy you must engage in direct political action but it changes the reader teaches us to be less judgmental
7038848 when salah was supposed to make a stand i was hoping hed make it
7038849 but he lost his courage this is happening every day giving a picture of people who are not very courageous is a way to push you to do something yourself
7038850 i love america but hate american foreign policy coming from a part of the world damaged for years by it
7038851 the cooperation between the fbi cia and arab dictators is documented even in congress american detainees are exported to be tortured in arab dictatorships and they come back with confessions why do dirty work in my house if i can do it elsewhere
7038852 his hair dyed jet black was rumoured to be one of the best hairpieces available in the world
7038853 its a pretext they wanted him in prison by any means
7038854 i had a liberal education i was a child when egypt was tolerant at the lyc e there were jews copts catholics wed celebrate three or four religious feasts this is the secret of egyptian civilisation weve been absorbing cultures for 60 centuries
7038855 great leader who guaranteed free education for social mobility but made one big mistake he left the machinery of dictatorship he was the no 1 enemy in the western media in the 50s and 60s and was afraid of establishing political parties that could be used against him but without democratic rule even if youre not corrupt you lose your vision
7038856 opportunity to keep contact with a world id never see elsewhere
7038857 didnt understand me though shes still my friend i could have stayed in america or worked in the gulf and made a fortune but i refused i was learning how to write
7038858 for 20 years arab novelists have thought that the way westerners write is best so if you tell stories youre old fashioned i was strongly against this i keep my own voice the novel is like a love affair if you plan everything you spoil the most beautiful part
7038859 language thats literary but not complicated easy to read but very difficult to write
7038860 i got good reviews but i called myself a successful writer without readers
7038861 every time you have trouble with the corrupt system in egypt
7038862 a young egyptian hears government propaganda that we egyptians taught the world how to write and says where are the pharoahs i dont see any i was accused of insulting my country which is very dangerous
7038863 im making money only because im a bestseller in the west
7038864 the government doesnt want writers to survive from their writing because in any country without democracy an independent writer or journalist is a threat
7038865 they want to keep any intellectual under pressure you dont have the time or concentration to rebel
7038866 i said its the egyptian peoples money not yours if i compromise ill betray my father
7038867 two related struggles in egypt the one for democracy and justice and the one between a tolerant culture and wahhabism
7038868 the fanatics are not real opponents of the regime but a complication of it if youre young and dont have hope youre pushed to be a criminal or a fanatic
7038869 last year the government threatened the owner of a caf but we continue to meet im proud that weve had young fanatics there some have become my friends i feel a commitment towards these young people who dont really have an education to be fanatic is to categorise people not to see the human being literature is the opposite its a very individual vision of life
7038870 was a very good student but was passed over as a policeman because he was from the wrong class
7038871 he said i hate this country this government is full of thieves and he had a point i felt that faced with a certain injustice anyone could become dangerous a terrorist because he had lost the dream of his life
7038872 any ruler in history with strategic plans from alexander the great to george bush has had to control egypt weve had terrible rulers and been occupied many times were professors of compromise but the moment egyptians believe compromise is no longer working they revolt i believe were at such a moment
7038873 you cant be an unelected regime and be liberal at the same time
7038874 what we have is not freedom of expression as a tool of democracy but freedom of talk as a decoration of the regime for more than 10 years you can say what you want but the regime does what it wants if you attack a minister they might even be promoted
7038875 theres a big difference between the culture and the regime
7038876 arab culture was very tolerant theres a category of arabic poetry about homosexual feelings
7038877 you cant defend the human rights of a group in society while everybody else is deprived of them there are 60 000 egyptians detained without charge many are in prison for more than 10 years and torture is a daily practice whats happening to homosexuals is happening to all egyptians
7038878 the stink of sour grapes is all over the arab world about alaas success
7038879 new era which cant be ignored either by those who loved the novel or by those who hated it as it disproved claims that arabs arent great readers
7038880 reward from readers they mean egypt is still more tolerant than it appears
7038881 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i its for charity its serious boxing you have to go get a trainer i have to register with the mature boxing association

7038886 youre going to have bad races and good races fortunately we had a good one
7038887 its hard not racing full time and running part time and trying to win and trying to run up front

7038889 this year we have struggled a little bit but were still getting top fives and top 10s and wins and we just need to be a little bit better im excited with what ive done here at rcr and its a great group of guys ive enjoyed working with them
7038890 so i have to get out there and start talking to people i know there are some rides that are still open for next year
7038891 its hard to get things lined up with sponsors and teams and teammates and all that stuff
7038892 scotts done a really good job not only in the nationwide car but in a lot of testing
7038893 hes been a guy thats been willing to do whatever the company has asked him to do hes put in a lot of hard days at race tracks when nobody knew he was there add comment

7038917 we are in a much better position today than we were before
7038918 i had petitions signed i did it in three months i turned everything in time and it ended up being 3 500 signatures
7038919 it shows people are ready for someone new and different
7038920 there is no need to spend millions to jumpstart the construction business we have thousands of foreclosures they would be better off spending a few thousands dollars to have foreclosure seminars and offer those houses at a lesser price we could have saved a few people facing foreclosure
7038921 we are raising our taxes just to turn around and spend it
7038922 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

7039000 russia is clearly irritated at what it perceives as u s meddling in its neighborhood
7039001 it seems to be sending a message that if you play on our periphery well play in yours
7039002 consistent work to restore traditional relations in all areas of cooperation
7039003 we need to re establish positions on cuba and in other countries
7039004 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
7039005 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
7039006 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
7039007 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted
7039008 russia seeks to reassert itself as a world power which includes a renewed presence in while cuba wants to diversify its economic partners to reduce its dependence on venezuela
7039009 we are at a critical point in our time where we can either educate or incarcerate
7039010 we can teach them now or run the risk of possible incarceration later on in life i dont want to see the latter
7039011 students and parents must understand that attending school is not optional
7039012 when they fail to attend school they are breaking the law
7039013 were all for keeping kids in school and we applaud any efforts to make that happen
7039014 but the privacy issue what happens with the bracelet or anklet after school is out is that appropriate for the school or courts to know where and what this person is doing outside of school
7039015 sometimes as i said students are runaways parents dont know where they are
7039016 so its for the safety of the child as well as the safety of the community
7039017 i walked into a house that had the worst colors i have ever seen
7039018 the walls were olive green and red a bedroom was painted chocolate brown
7039019 i buy piece by piece because i do not want the house to look like a showroom
7039020 i love to cook and my next big project will be to update the kitchen with granite countertops
7039021 i love that this house is an ongoing work in progress

7039032 he is under contract but he wants to join manchester united the problem is we dont want to sell
7039033 i cant see how it could be possible for him to leave he has signed a contract with his parents
7039034 no player will be kept here against their will this does not mean that madrid will not defend the interests of the club
7039035 im sure that robinho has already weighed up the consequences of his decision and im sure that in the next few days he will give a letter to the club to announce that he wants to go if he does not want to be here he should leave as soon as possible
7039036 he would end his contract but the courts will decide what he has to pay
7039037 if the club sells one or two more players its not a problem for me i dont know if some clubs want shaun in the last game he played 25 30 minutes and he has played for the second time in the first group of training
7039038 i dont know what the player is thinking about with regards offers from other teams if i have 24 25 players with me and three or four for every two positions then im happy i have three or four players in this wing right and wing left position

7039086 the vast majority of chinese people accepted that this was a very important chance to improve national solidarity and to show chinas progress to the world these goals have been reinforced and the chinese government has been quite successful at it
7039087 i have conducted operas in the west and it was so troublesome
7039088 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights we do not have that we can work very hard we can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month other than north korea no other country in the world can achieve this
7039089 this kind of uniformity brings beauty we chinese can do it too
7039090 our program had the highest level of political review since the founding of the peoples republic of china basically all reviews were from the central committee
7039091 we dont see any sign by the chinese leadership that it wants to establish genuine political reform its obvious that the party has no intention of accepting any diminution of its monopoly on power

7039093 esse foi um dos momentos mais emocionantes da minha vida
7039094 the mother may not want the child and she should have a choice
7039095 what if the birth would endanger the life of the mother
7039096 we sure could make a lot of progress on the birth control education front if we tried
7039097 i just dont think a decision like that should be decided by anybody other than the woman that is going to have to bear the child
7039098 well im personally opposed to slavery and i think its wrong but i would never tell anyone else they cannot own slaves because its not my place
7039099 please dont tell me teenagers are ignorant about birth control that is absolutely false what teenagers are ignorant about is making moral choices
7039100 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
7039101 if you see abortion as an absolute wrong then you force women to be lesser human beings
7039102 love sexual or otherwise is a conscious decision to think that we as humans cannot decide for ourselves when and whom we love is an attempt to reduce our inherent value
7039103 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit it is impossible to calculate the moral mischief if i may so express it that mental lying has produced in society when a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime he takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain and in order to qualify himself for that trade he begins with a perjury can we conceive anything more destructive to morality than this
7039104 if you see abortion as an absolute wrong then you force women to be lesser human beings incapable of moral decision making and incapable of controlling their own reproduction how is this acceptable how can it not be the case
7039105 every public school in america teaches sex education with their savior being the condom
7039106 as far as gods will respondning to eddie no god of mine would intentionally test a womans strength or put her through an intentional trial via rape
7039107 are you saying that teenagers dont know about birth control
7039108 women must hold on to the sacred right of control of their own bodies
7039109 the use of the word innocent in reference to the life of an embryo or even a fetus puzzles me it is utterly meaningless to ascribe innocence or the equivalent absence of guilt to a being that is in no way a moral agent a person capable of making decisions
7039110 before i formed you in the womb i knew you and before you were born i consecrated you
7039111 for it was you who formed my inward parts you knit me together in my mothers womb
7039112 it was you who took me from the womb you kept me safe at my mothers breast
7039113 women must demand to have control of their own bodies
7039114 the use of the word innocent in reference to the life of an embryo or even a fetus puzzles me it is utterly meaningless to ascribe innocence or the equivalent absence of guilt to a being that is in no way a moral agent a person capable of making decisions
7039115 not too many people are tortured so we shouldnt worry about it
7039116 not too many people are killed by armed assailants so we shouldnt worry about it
7039117 not too many people die from aids so we shouldnt worry about it
7039118 not to many people are denied civil rights these days so we shouldnt worry about it
7039119 not too many women are raped and abused so we shouldnt worry about it
7039120 this christian woman believes in a womans right to make her own decisions
7039121 si vous avez besoin que je d missionne dans lint r t de la premier league je suis daccord du moment que cela ne change rien
7039122 the greatest discovery of my generation is that man can alter his life simply by altering his attitude of mind
7039123 as far has history goes and all of these quotes about people trying to guess what the history of the bush administration is going to be you know i take great comfort in knowing that they dont know what they are talking about because history takes a long time for us to reach
7039124 it is a bit too early to judge whether bushs presidency is the worst ever though it certainly has a shot to take the title without a doubt it is among the worst
7039125 glib contemptuous ignorant incurious a dupe of anyone who humors his deluded belief in his heroic self he has bankrupted the country with his disastrous war and his tax breaks for the rich trampled on the bill of rights appointed foxes in every henhouse compounded the terrorist threat turned a blind eye to torture and corruption and a looming ecological disaster and squandered the rest of the worlds good will in short no other presidents faults have had so deleterious an effect on not only the country but the world at large
7039126 with his unprovoked and disastrous war of aggression in iraq and his montrous deficits bush has set this country on a course that will take decades to correct
7039127 when future historians look back to identify the moment at which the unites states began to lose it position of world leadership they will point rightly to the bush presidency thanks to his policies it is now easy to see america losing out to it competitors in any number of areas china is rapidly becoming the manufacturing powerhouse of the next century india the high tech and services leader and europe the region with the best quality of life
7039128 an idealogue who got the nation into a totally unnecessary war and has broken the constitution more often than even nixon
7039129 it would be difficult to identify a president who facing major international and domestic crises has failed in both as clearly as president bush
7039130 have had the cumulative effect of shoring up a semi permanent aristocracy of capital that dwarfs the aristocracy of land against which the founding fathers rebelled of encouraging a mindless retreat from science and rationalism and of crippling the nations economic base
7039131 george bush has combined mediocrity with malevolent policies and has thus seriously damaged the welfare and standing of the unites states
7039132 he knows how to make the very rich very much richer and he has an amazing talent for f ing up everything else he even approaches his administration has been the most reckless dangerous irresponsible mendacious arrogant self righteous incompetent and deeply corrupt on in all of american history
7039133 i came into the league in 1985 and i knew him from a distance then
7039134 by the time the strike came in 1987 you could see how driven he was to advance our cause i just grew to have the utmost respect for what hes been able to do ever since
7039135 i think his legacy will be that of one of the very few people who had a very significant impact on the national football league
7039136 he had an impact as a player and as a union leader and as good as he was as a player his impact as a union leader far outweighs that he benefited thousands of people past present and future players
7039137 but no one could ultimately question from a big picture standpoint the job he has done the job he was doing and the job he would have done
7039138 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away

7039144 i always thought that old age was something that happens at the end of your life a phase

7039146 got us off on wrong foot and tore at fabric of the community in a process of misunderstanding
7039147 we get wedded to something i am disappointed in the process it has caused a great deal of division in the community

7039177 antes de despenalizar deber amos educar y trabajar en prevenci n
7039178 despenalizar el consumo de drogas en un pa s que no ha invertido en educaci n y prevenci n es tirar a nuestros hijos a las garras de los narcos sin darles ning n arma de defensa
7039179 la discusi n cuasi filos fica sobre el origen del paco que plantea fern ndez es una forma de bajarle el precio a un problema dram tico que resume en s mismo el fen meno de la droga y la inseguridad
7039180 si fern ndez cree que no hay control sobre algunas drogas l deber a denunciar a los responsables de ese descontrol adem s deber a hablarnos acerca del control de fronteras que hoy son una puerta abierta a los narcos y que estuvieron bajo su rbita en el ministerio del interior
7039181 los argumentos que da el ministro buscan plantear una realidad falsa que busca justificar la despenalizaci n a cualquier costo porque he hablado con much simos jueces de distintas corrientes ideol gicas y todos aseguraron que nunca se ha detenido con c rcel a un consumidor de drogas
7039182 la actitud de an bal fern ndez es absolutamente irresponsable porque l es un bonaerense y en esa provincia como en todas sufrimos a diario el delito y la violencia que tienen como uno de los principales responsables al avance del narcotr fico

7039195 the reason i go into such detail here is that the need to reinvent ones business is a natural recurring event that must occur if you are going to stay ahead of your competition and keep amazing customers reinvention is not an optional activity especially in todays economy

7039403 she participated in the shoot and we didnt know anything about her
7039404 but when we started reviewing the photos the girl that kept popping out of the background was isis
7039405 its wonderful if the world would catch up to speed
7039406 while the actual number of transgender representations on tv remains relatively small what were seeing on tv is a move away from the stereotypical marginalized roles weve seen in the past sex workers behind bars being murdered
7039407 these more diverse and accurate representations play a vital role in helping audiences understand transgender lives
7039408 maybe its time for a tranny to end up on the cover of april dowling the sixth houseguest evicted from big brother 10 survivor ethan zohn dribbling from boston to washington for charity alison sweeney producer dish about the biggest loser families former the bachelor star jesse palmer credits show for espn gig top model producer transgender model to help

7039411 even something like playing a computer game is valuable the subconscious goes to sleep and when it wakes up it panics the point of procrastination is to get the subconscious thinking
7039412 hopefully i will get all that stuff into the blood stream and use it later
7039413 writing is rewriting the first draft is not important it is something to work on
7039414 the two ronnies had more words for breasts than eskimos have for snow
7039415 when you are cutting good stuff it means you are on the right track
7039416 television is competing with the web and aping some of its worst qualities
7039417 it is about treating disabled people terribly but in such a way that no one can be offended
7039418 the way of writing sitcoms is to think of these set pieces first
7039419 writing with a partner is paid socialising writing on your own is work
7039420 you are reviewing a show that doesnt exist yet how do you know you can write a sitcom until you write one
7039421 one of the things ive learned in america from running a business is accountability if i dont hit my business plan ill get fired why shouldnt the same apply for executives who fail to hit their ethnic minority targets
7039422 lack of movement amongst the mainly white commissioning executives at the bbc and channel 4
7039423 these are talented people but its easy to see why people tell me they feel theres a magic circle when it comes to the top jobs on our industry if the opportunities are so limited for white executives what chance do minorities have
7039424 the days of shouting upstairs to alert the whole family that theres a black or asian person on tv
7039425 we have an asian woman angela jain running e4 seetha kumar guided the bbc hd service from launch though the public value tests and jay kandola is head of acquisitions at itv
7039426 no public target for senior management and no breakdown between production where i think senior management is all white and commissioning
7039427 diversity has been one of the victims of the demise of itvs regional structure and the status quo there simply isnt good enough more transparency is needed
7039428 more chance of there being a black man in charge of the white house than being in charge of white city
7039429 little point in replacing one oxbridge educated white male with an oxbridge educated black male
7039430 theres a definite influence in nearly all the fashion lines being unveiled for this fall
7039431 but its a different level of taste than what we saw 25 years ago its not as over the top as what we had during 80s and its clear to see designers have taken a softer approach
7039432 this years glamorama event is extremely special as it marks our 10th anniversary supporting the art institute of chicago
7039433 were proud to partner with the art institute in making the arts more accessible to our local communities each and every day
7039434 glamorama 2008 is taking all the fashions that were considered so totally awesome and giving them a modern twist
7039435 weve already seen some of this starting in the previous season with names like mary kate and ashley olsen wearing headbands now youre going to see them everywhere
7039436 id love to take you to enter place of choice this summer
7039437 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7039438 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7039439 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7039440 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7039441 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7039442 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7039443 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7039444 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7039445 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7039446 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7039447 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7039448 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7039449 giving special attention to ninth grade is the first order of business
7039450 but then apply the same general principles to grades 10 through 12 so students arent faced with the same problems but just a year later
7039451 my view is that the buffer zones are against the spirit of the ceasefire agreement
7039452 why do they want to take control of poti they do not have such a right
7039453 maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here if they were our friends they would not do this
7039454 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they georgian forces will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them

7039550 but weve seen executions in the lit side as well as in the dark pool and weve had executions between the visible and the dark so that begins to validate our market model
7039551 we had something like 10 percent market share in one of the illiquid names where there was a large dark execution

7039643 at last my hair will be in the perfect context
7039644 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7039645 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7039646 which politician is most likely to make a jaw dropping news cycle stopping gaffe
7039647 i think it is an outright terrible decision on obamas part to pick biden yes he helps balance obamas inexperience on foreign policy but he also reminds people of it yes biden could conceivably be effective as an attack dog but biden is such a gasbag he makes the hindenburg look like a sack of rocks
7039648 biden is almost a neocon in his foreign policy views he voted for the iraq war in 2002 does his elevation by obama signal that that the obama campaign is backing away from its timetable to withdraw from iraq does bidens position differ significantly from mccains isnt he in fact closer to mccains view on iraq than obama is

7039657 theyre obviously the defending champion and ill get to play with a good friend of mine in drapes i hope i can add a lot to their team especially on the defensive end
7039658 we knew we needed another forward or two going into free agency but to get a guy of this quality is great for the team
7039659 im confident we can score goals as a forward group but you can never have enough glue guys those guys that can go out and kill off a penalty late in the third when youve got a one goal lead kirk is one of those guys
7039660 there was laughter involved and no small amount of disgust

7039663 le nuove tecnologie certamente offrono maggiori possibilit espressive e comunicative favorendo il coinvolgimento personale degli studenti ma a noi docenti si richiede anche tanta creativit e maggiore impegno nelle modalit dinsegnamento per i nuovi processi di apprendimento
7039664 luso delle nuove tecnologie da parte di un docente richiede un sacco di tempo e non porta risparmi di tempo nel medio lungo periodo a differenza di quanto avviene nelle aziende e nel lavoro autonomo come tanti penso anchio che leffetto principale di questo lavoro addizionale sia un miglioramento della didattica e dellinterazione con gli studenti a fronte di ci pi lavoro e maggiore efficacia didattica i benefit sono zero a parte la gratificazione personale

7039667 how do you get activity going if the moon is owned by everyone at the same time
7039668 im happy to deed over half of my acre to a common acre pool i see this as a way of reconciling a right of individual ownership and the idea that the moon belongs to the whole earth
7039669 its much easier to solve this problem by thinking it through and thinking through what would most benefit the best interest of humanity rather than doing it once its a mess

7039757 races are almost three hours long and some people might think that the drivers take it easy during the qualifying session but as weve seen all year the gt and the prototype cars leave no margin of error whatsoever while chasing pole position
