4200025 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4200026 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4200027 its exciting because we believe that we can do it

4200042 you order the cupcake but you really want the frosting
4200043 it brings you back to when you used to lick the container or whatever your mom made it in
4200044 this is like a classic food trend a lot of people are thinking of the same thing at the same time which is really how most food things start
4200045 were not talking molecular gastronomy its kind of reducing down to the basic element of what a cupcake is
4200046 it really became a big thing i tried to stop offering them
4200047 but i would see people on the street and theyd be like where are the frosting shots they would get on my case about that

4200237 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4200238 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4200239 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4200240 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4200241 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4200242 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4200243 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4200244 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4200245 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4200246 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4200247 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4200248 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4200249 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4200250 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4200251 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4200252 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4200253 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4200254 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4200255 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4200256 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4200257 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4200258 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4200259 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4200260 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
4200261 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4200262 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4200263 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4200264 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4200265 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4200266 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4200267 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4200268 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4200269 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4200270 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4200271 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4200272 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4200273 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4200274 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4200278 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4200279 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4200280 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4200281 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4200282 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4200283 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4200284 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4200285 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4200286 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo

4200292 the system we deploy in the home becomes the trojan horse for a much higher level of functionality for things we have today and will develop in the future
4200293 you install the hardware and then collect 35 to 40 a month even if you do nothing more
4200294 we note that the responses of certain companies such as google suggest that your inquiry is narrow and focused on a single technology deep packet inspection
4200295 we do not read the questions so narrowly indeed to do so suggests that the significant policy questions posed here depend on the technology at issue
4200296 if you want to avoid an act of sexual aggression dont wear provocative clothes be careful with your glances and your gestures dont find yourself alone with a man even if you know him dont get too familiar with your friends or relatives dont allow risqu conversations or jokes look for help when you suspect someone has bad intentions
4200297 there are 13 year old adolescents minors who are totally in agreement with doing it and wanting it if you arent careful they provoke you

4200305 i thought theres something to this it was one of those life changing experiences i just left behind everything else i was doing
4200306 i enjoy working alongside scientists in creating images that utilize different types of equipment some of my best work has come from listening to those who use the equipment daily and have a thorough understanding of its use
4200307 the team built a very strong and balanced foundation last fall and this past spring because of the developments and improvements of our team on and off the field in the last 12 months we as a program can be very excited about our opportunities to dream believe and achieve success this season
4200308 the coaching staff believes that this will be the first season that the returning group of players will be the base for on field success allowing new members time to adjust and contribute to our programs success
4200309 throughout the summer i have repeatedly said let the games begin i am looking forward to getting started with our 2008 campaign and as i shared with the team see for what medals we will compete this season
4200310 although we graduated two high scoring forwards in manning and elenz martin i am confident that the 2008 team will have renewed and improved attacking powers and the ability to score field goals and goals off set plays it is nice to know that we return all americans deacon and rijpma the 2007 big ten freshman of the year steinmetz and welcome three time high school all american to the spartan attack unit also our other forwards and midfield players have become more of a scoring threat looking back at our numbers this past spring
4200311 last year we pretty much had a brand new midfield throughout the 2007 2008 campaign they continued their individual and midfield line development
4200312 the program invested a lot of time this past spring to put together and develop a fairly new defensive unit due to the graduation of both fullbacks schneider and van der laag we had to reconstruct our backfield the spring proved to be very beneficial for players like ackerman lucik magee raynor and van ierland to develop into their new roles the addition of freshmen to the defensive unit will strengthen our backfield even more
4200313 our goalkeepers have made huge steps forward in their individual development as goalkeepers and architects of our backfield defense the last 12 months as a coach i couldnt be happier than when a player or goalkeeper makes a full commitment to their position and takes true ownership in their own development goalies unger and miller have done so and have learned a lot about themselves and their role i am also positive that with the new hire of assistant goalkeeping coach my goalkeepers will further develop and allow the spartan field hockey program to compete for championships in the big ten conference and qualification for the ncaa tournament
4200314 im very excited to welcome molly to my coaching staff and the spartan program
4200315 what is more rewarding for a program to be able to welcome a former player back as a student coach amy will be a great liaison for the coaches and players this fall and she will be able to help our young back field to further develop and understand their individual and line roles i am very happy to have amy as part of our team and my coaching staff for another year
4200316 weve talked about how to conduct ourselves socially and we continue to work hard towards that
4200317 certainly our players have an understanding that the incidents that happened this summer we are not proud of and it is not going to continue
4200318 im excited about our running backs theres going to be some young speed guys who work hard
4200319 to build our team with the young skill guys that we have
4200320 i would much rather come into a new situation where we have experience on the offensive front and experience on the defensive front and have inexperience at the skill positions because we know the offensive line and the defensive line really control the game
4200321 they give the quarterback an opportunity to have some time and space to throw the ball
4200322 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4200323 nobody calls me lebowski you got the wrong guy im the dude man

4200333 we are deciding right now between the intel atom and amds competitor
4200334 its always better to have content that is directly relevant to what people are searching for so if your own product descriptions and attributes are better youll get better results
4200335 i think you need to start with writing the best copy you can for your target audience then step back and look at it from an seo perspective not just a marketing perspective
4200336 any place where you can modify the language and add wording for keyword phrase is an opportunity because sometimes in the context of the copy you might not add it because it would already be understood
4200337 if you change a platform or where a product is located and people cant find it thats obviously bad for business
4200338 you need to set redirects from the old url to the new unfortunately this is one of those tasks that can take an inordinate amount of time if you do it one by one manually so if you have an seo platform be sure to set rules based on the data to have this done automatically and youll save a lot of time
4200339 you cant manage all the external links to your site perfectly so the best thing is to be prepared for when some other site generates a broken link to your site the back up plan is to capitalize on the opportunity by customizing and merchandising the error page dont just show the dreaded generic error page
4200340 at a minimum you should show some products there and humor always helps anything to draw the customer back in once theyve found you through a search link
4200341 this is another thing can have a huge impact on your search ranking but something that takes a lot of time to do right so if you have an seo platform you want one that can automatically generate a google sitemap
4200342 its like submitting a roadmap to the google crawler of what the key pages are in your site what the structure is so it can crawl your site effectively you can also tell google how often your pages change so the robots know how often to come back essentially it ensures google always has updated information on your site set up
4200343 follow similar practices as you do for standard pages but be sure to keep landing pages up to date for instance if you sell seasonal products think of specific topics for landing pages that will cause them to show up high in search results you can even make them dynamic meaning that the content that shows up depends on the search words used tailored to that more specific search
4200344 these objects have keywords like any other page so if you put in tags theyll be more likely to be found

4200369 therefore our number one charge must be to preserve the freedom of the internet and all other means of communication
4200370 we now have a capability of someone to radicalize themselves over the internet
4200371 they can train themselves over the internet they never have to necessarily go to the training camp or speak with anybody else and that diffusion of a combination of hatred and technical skills in things like bomb making is a dangerous combination
4200372 those are the kind of terrorists that we may not be able to detect with spies and satellites

4200641 although the idea that brightly colored insects could facilitate the search for medicinally active plants has been discussed for decades the concept had never been rigorously tested our new work suggests that a quick screen for insects with warning coloration on tropical plants may increase the efficiency of the search for compounds active against cancer and tropical parasitic disease by four fold another example of how ecology can contribute to the discovery of novel medicines its very gratifying to see that it works in the field
4200642 i am hopeful that other investigators will follow our lead and test our theory that insects can lead us to plants with disease fighting properties our work also demonstrates that the protection of tropical forests not just the insects and plants but at every level has the potential to provide immeasurable benefits to human health
4200643 all these young people are having an incredible impact on their communities and it was my hope that by telling their stories i would inspire others to action as well
4200644 we believe it will catalyse a cultural sea of change trans forming a generation of young people into capable leaders
4200645 young people the world over are uniting to battle against systemic social problems in a way no generation has done before
4200646 we have the education ability and determination to change our world community by community so if things are going to change it has to start with us

4200653 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores
4200654 this is a miracle i am very thankful to god
4200655 passage of the law that prohibits smoking in bars restaurants airports offices and all other public spaces was a milestone in public health we must protect this pro health law and focus attention on the necessity to retain and strengthen it during the 2008 legislative session in addition we must continue our funding to support adults and children who suffer from asthma and other chronic pulmonary diseases this fabulous concert will help us do that
4200656 i sing for a living and cant tolerate smoking where i earn my livelihood
4200657 the new no smoking law is a hit among all the entertainers because it will extend our careers as well as our lives the evidence continues to support the fact that secondhand smoke kills
4200658 i am asthmatic and suffered for years singing in public while surrounded by smokers
4200659 it was especially difficult when cigar smoking was the rage and we would literally have groups of 10 20 people coming in surrounding us and lighting up cigars the air was so thick you could hardly see through it i absolutely could not breathe and my doctors said i was in serious risk of losing my voice altogether because of the secondhand smoke i totally support the cause the concert and the fight for clean air
4200660 as an island state we know all too well the importance of clean air both indoors and outdoors
4200661 please join us as we work to prevent lung disease and promote lung health through research and education and celebrate with us as many of hawai is top entertainers come together to support our efforts
4200662 these results suggest that far too many family members seem unaware that their smoking habit is harming their children
4200663 we must continue our work to spread the word to smokers that the health of their entire family can be improved now and for decades to come if they accept our help and quit

4200672 i just wanted to try to get in front of him and keep him from swimming out there and drowning
4200673 started to swim started to make the four mile swim across the harbor and so i looked at a colleague and i said ive got to go out there and stop him so i took off my shirt and shoes jumped in the water and swam in the direction to head him off and keep him from going into deeper water once i did that i got in front of him tried to create some splashing and some commotion and tried to get him to go back into shore but he wasnt having any of that the scariest part was probably when he decided he started looking at me as if he wanted to climb up on me to keep from drowning and at one point he reared up on his hind legs so im looking at a six and a half foot tall bear instead of lunging forward he fell straight back and was submerged for a couple of seconds and thats kinda when i moved in
4200674 warwick kept one arm underneath the bear and the other gripping the scruff of its neck to keep the bears head above water
4200675 it may be that seeing your own babys face is like a natural high said lane strathearn an assistant professor of pediatrics at baylor and and texas childrens hospital who studied the brain reactions of 28 first time moms
4200676 whether that feels the same as a shot of cocaine im not sure
4200677 we want to understand what happens in this relationship with mothers and babies
4200678 we dont know whether this response is learned or innate
4200679 people tend to think that were innately good parents but it so happens that parenting in humans and in non human primates has to be learned
4200680 its got to be like crack i just have to see them everywhere
4200681 all we have is coffee and coffee isnt enough the harvest only last a few months anyway so even at the best of prices we have 7 or 8 months without income anyway we need alternatives
4200682 do you spend 20 000 on a single transplant or buy vaccines for many children in africa
4200683 how can we do the most good for the greatest number with the resources we have
4200684 one out of every 10 foundation dollars spent is going to have the gates name on it and that gives gates and his foundation an influence that is impossible to calculate
4200685 bill gates is now the face of philanthropy for the country if not the world
4200686 the gateses will have an obligation to lead and deliver for decades to come
4200687 i mean is it going to erode your ability you know to make money
4200688 its awkward for me to be out in the field
4200689 i meet many high net worth individuals that are watching gates and what he does and how he does it and thats really exciting in a behavioral way
4200690 it opens up peoples minds to whats possible with philanthropy today
4200691 bill has an incredible opportunity to help shape the thinking of other multibillionaires by getting them to think about the process the structure the best practices
4200692 one of the key questions now becomes do they decentralize
4200693 gates as an entrepreneur and innovator has dealt with scale before the thing to watch now is how he manages that rapid growth and tension that comes with it one option is to focus on many areas of giving versus the three existing ones another is to build collaboration ties with established public and private foundations ngos social enterprises and corporations
4200694 what matters most at the end of the day is outcome
4200695 for those who have been criticizing the gates foundation on its need to grow faster and operate more effectively one could say they made the best possible choice
4200696 raikes is someone who isnt intimidated by gates immense wealth and who has in his own right been extremely successful
4200697 is that its a lot like microsoft in the sense that we do expect results
4200698 that is much too small and narrow a board to run a foundation whose combined assets will one day exceed the budgets of all but 30 percent of the countries in the world
4200699 this offers little protection to americas taxpayers or the national interest
4200700 boards are wiser when they have a large number of people because they provide people coming from different backgrounds and experiences
4200701 there are going to be other billionaires in the future who are going to establish 40 billion 50 billion 75 billion foundations
4200702 the danger to our democracy is that were going to have an increasing number of these mega foundations run by two or three family members who will dictate how these assets are spent their decisions are going to be made without any political process public discussion and that is not good for democracy
4200703 distorting research priorities and quashing independent thinking by sweeping up the best scientists and keeping them locked up in a cartel
4200704 is squashing the peer review process because researchers are now bunched into groups competing for gates funding and each member of such a group has a vested interest to safeguard the work of the other the magazine reported quoting from the memo
4200705 but a lot of money leads to a monopoly and discourages smaller rivals and intellectual competition
4200706 that countered the foundations charitable goals or socially concerned philosophy
4200707 have failed tests of social responsibility because of environmental lapses employment discrimination disregard for workers rights or unethical behavior
4200708 the gates foundation hasnt tried to influence other foundations to divest from companies that dont share their socially responsible ideals
4200709 the foundations poor example here should be a siren call for reforms and stepped up oversight
4200710 changes in our investment practice would have little or no impact on the suffering identified in the los angeles times article we dont own big enough stakes in companies to influence their behavior through shareholder activism
4200711 with the resources that the gates foundation has at its command it could provide an extraordinarily important leadership role for the field if it were willing to shift its investments to more socially responsible companies
4200712 when the no 1 foundation is rethinking something others are going to look at it more carefully
4200713 from those to whom much is given much is expected
4200714 bill and i like to work on the problems that nobody else seems to want to face because theyre so hard
4200715 im uniquely able to reach out to the big companies to ask them not just to write checks but to offer more of their innovative power
4200716 theres a big category of my time for talking to drug companies cell phone companies banks and technology companies as well as talking with other people who are lucky enough to have super big fortunes about how they want to give those back to society
4200717 this opens an opportunity to use mobile technology for reworking banking for the poor
4200718 technological revolutions or advances as the price of cell phones really get down how can we change things for people who live on less than 2 a day
4200719 but then again youve got to take risks and thats one of the things a philanthropist can do that governments arent as well suited to do we in philanthropy should be doing the things that the normal approaches cant do whether its approaches to the aids vaccine or malaria or delivery systems weve got to be out there and accept some kind of failure rate
4200720 humanitys greatest advances are not in is discoveries but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity reducing human inequity is the highest human achievement

4200753 it wasnt very long ago in terms of human history that it took a month for news of the presidents death in the united states to go from washington d c to st louis
4200754 in 20 decades we have gone from that to any individual being able to create a message and instantaneously circulate it to millions of people we find this to be tremendously seductive it gives us a sense of power and a sense of control that we havent had over our environment in the past
4200755 this event is definitely horrific i dont know if theres anything worse in canadian history quite frankly
4200756 exacerbates situations because thats when people start turning to rumours

4200775 i saw her at j crew about a month ago were both new moms with little girls so we started talking
4200776 the baby was really cute of course she seemed like a nice lady not someone out for fame and fortune she never mentioned edwards
4200777 you could tell she was a good mom she had the baby close to her in a baby bjorn she was carrying the weight
4200778 we started talking and she said she was from new york i told her i was from new york too and i asked her what part at that point i guess i was asking too many questions because she just decided to go
4200779 but i told her what a cute baby she had the baby was in a sling facing me and she was really cute
4200780 i was thinking it was strange because mostly when you say what a beautiful baby parents get excited but she didnt react she only wanted to leave
4200781 she told me her name was joya or something like that

4200796 we are concerned about having a scientology group in our area
4200797 about a month ago i found materials from anonymous the group that protests scientology in a local coffee place after reading theat scientology was moving in here then i saw anonymous actually protesting in front of their building and i was all right on we dont want malibu to get like hollywood with uniformed scientology goons everywhere trying to influence politicians and locals with awards and donations and their bogus front groups

4200861 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4200874 its a nonsense im not saying i never did it i did do it but what i am saying is i did it two years ago now why did they let the transfer go through in the first place i believe there is a witch hunt against me and it has never ended
4200875 ask the fa there is a witch hunt everybody knows so i will leave it at that
4200876 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january 2008 was approved at the time by the premier league and fas compliance unit

4200878 reina is the best goalie of any of the big four keepers
4200879 unlike the other shooters i dont have peripheral vision and i dont have depth perception because of my eye
4200880 ive overcome this with lots of determination and fighting spirit
4200881 i have a different strategy i stand back a little to get a better perspective
4200882 shooting in the middle position is the most difficult for me especially getting the targets flying from the left
4200883 for a player its not the greatest feeling sitting in the stands watching the team play in a must win game
4200884 i hope this never happens to me ever again i want to be on the field helping the guys out i felt bad
4200885 freddy had a good tournament he has a good mentality and a very good future in the team
4200886 he needs to establish himself he needs to play because with every single game he got better
4200887 i think hes grown a lot hes been through a lot of those trying times and i think he has a good grasp on what he should and shouldnt do
4200888 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000

4200891 she pulled up and waited for the other filly last saturday and when it got to her she fought back again but it was too late
4200892 so this week i am going to put the pull down blinds on her we have used them in the past in similar circumstances and found they worked well
4200893 it has been a long season and maybe she is coming to the end so this might be the best way to wake her up
4200894 i think the australian drivers might take her a bit lightly after last saturday and if she can sneak a slow half 800m somewhere i think she can still win
4200895 it is a tough field obviously with safari there but i am happy with how he is working so i am hoping he can get a run through and get one late shot at them
4200896 qwest is well prepared to handle all of the data content that will be streaming through the democratic national convention
4200897 never before has speed played such an important role in a national convention and qwest is excited for the world to see the capabilities of our network infrastructure
4200898 as you all know the newspaper industry like many other businesses and industries is in the midst of a difficult economic time
4200899 is to show how unfit barack obama is to be commander in chief the more people start paying attention to the election and learning about obama the less likely they are to support him
4200900 we had to import food on a huge scale after crop losses due to last years twin floods and cyclone sidr
4200901 and the price hike of food in international markets made things all the worse
4200902 prices of petroleum and fertiliser also reached unusual highs pushing import bills abnormally high in the last fiscal compared with any period
4200903 last years high import expenditure was mainly caused by sudden increase of food prices
4200904 however we have had a good boro rice harvest we are also expecting good production of aman
4200905 and at the same time food and petroleum prices are on the decline in the international market
4200906 the target on export earnings could not be achieved in the last fiscal despite a 15 percent growth
4200907 the prices of our major export product readymade garments declined drastically in the international market
4200908 before we could earn 10 by exporting a single t shirt now we cant get more than 8
4200909 the prices of apparel are declining as consumers in us and europe are squeezing their budgets due to recession
4200910 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
4200911 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
4200912 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
4200913 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
4200914 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
4200915 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
4200916 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
4200917 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
4200918 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
4200919 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
4200920 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
4200921 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
4200922 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
4200923 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
4200924 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
4200925 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
4200926 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
4200927 was to see him tell us that weve failed urban school kids sure we have but it wasnt without his help he was a defender of the status quo in the city of chicago for eight years and as a national rock star he could be turning his guns back at the educational system in chicago he doesnt
4200928 barack obama is inspiring us like a desert lover a washington valentino c ouples all over america are making love again and shouting yes we can as they climax
4200929 most abetted his career in politics while talking or writing about a deeply contraversial subject he considers all points of view before cautiously giving his own often risk averse assessment an opinion that often appears so universal that people of various viewpoints would consider it their own

4200960 were not sure if google will enter our market but hopefully well have developed our product enough that it will be a real sustainable business by that time
4200961 we think google might enter our market at some point and if they do they and their competitors will certainly consider buying us creating a bidding war for our entrenched position
4200962 google is a very big company right now with a very big cash machine that they have to focus on and protect they will never do our business with our level of focus we will out execute them on all fronts

4200982 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4200983 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4200984 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4200985 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4200988 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4200989 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4200990 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4200993 3 the resolution avoids skeptical shady strategies that people have lately been employing on topics that have been annoying a lot of people for instance the principle of taint of injustice is irrelevant to this topic as are skeptical arguments and arguments like anarchy good
4200994 resolved in the united states jury nullification is a legitimate check on the government
4200995 why does everyone dislike this topic resolved it is morally permissible to kill one innocent person to save the lives of more innocent people
4200996 there can be no primary metaphorization of our sexual difference so that we can represent ourselves reshape the meaning of feminine and transmit our significance to humanity between the generations
4200997 terrible all else i will not debate for that month if the one innocent reso comes through
4200998 that was one hell of a european festival season three trips back and forth and what a great time with a bunch of really good shows we cannot thank you all enough for all the support and it is because of you that we are invited to all these festivals thank you we finished up with a show in denmark with our good friends in agnostic front that was an awesome show and anytime we get together with those guys it is a party waiting to happen it had been a while since we were in denmark and it turned out to be a great show at a great venue we finished up our run in germany at the party san festival and what a party it was we had the bus parked there til 5 am and i dont remember the party ending this actually turned out to be one of the best shows we did this summer what a way to finish things up a sea of people going crazy and it was nice to headine that show

4201004 the american bar association meeting in new york is considering whether to recommend that judges use their discretion to make juries aware of the problems that can plague cross racial identifications
4201005 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury

4201008 out of their mouths today to me all of them said theyre looking for a missing child thats what im doing im looking for a missing child and that is what im asking the public to do
4201009 i went online this morning and read up on a lot of cadaver dogs
4201010 i was out yesterday doing my own foot pounding up in another county based on some tips and some leads so yeah were all out there kind of doing our own thing
4201011 i believe my daughter i know that someone has my granddaughter
4201012 obviously we dont want anybody whos not trained in law enforcement and proper procedures to do anything out of the norm that they think they should be doing
4201013 we get tips every day on zenaida gonzalez they have over a thousand zenaida gonzalezes that are linked to the places that casey told them to look so it does take time to search through private individuals are doing it authorities are doing it private investigators are doing it family members are doing it
4201014 one of those tips is going to say hey i know exactly where caylee is at and its probably going to be a very covert operation

4201019 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4201020 we will achieve independence in accordance with all of the rules of international law
4201021 the aim of independence has been set and we will move toward it together
4201022 lets ask the american side so that you are convinced of whether the cargo is humanitarian or not
4201023 the guy who threw the grenade was always at the top of the list
4201024 really affects some of the high profile cases that gen hartmann has had his hands in
4201025 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4201026 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4201027 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4201028 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4201029 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4201030 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4201031 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4201032 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4201033 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4201034 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4201035 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4201036 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4201037 finally british consumers can find information about the quality of products and best prices at one site
4201038 we have spent more than three years to develop a technology which enables us to cut through all the nonsense spam that consumers normally will find on the internet when using regular search engines to research products and look for expert reviews at testseek co uk we only publish the really useful content like good bad bottomline textual snippets from the reviews but also all product marks all editorial awards all product images and other users opinions
4201039 our goal is to create the ultimate shopping comparison engine we want to inform consumers about everything that could be of value to them

4201065 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4201066 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4201067 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4201068 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4201069 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4201070 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4201071 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4201072 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4201073 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4201074 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4201075 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4201076 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4201077 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4201078 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4201079 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4201080 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4201081 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4201082 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4201083 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4201084 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4201085 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4201086 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4201087 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4201088 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4201089 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4201090 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4201091 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4201092 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4201093 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4201094 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4201095 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4201096 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4201097 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4201098 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4201099 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4201100 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4201101 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4201102 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4201103 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4201104 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4201105 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4201106 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4201107 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4201108 help parents understand the talents and special skill set their children have brought to the planet
4201109 the map is not the territory is a major dictum in semantics
4201110 parents could remember that a childs chart wheel or any interpretation is a map not the territory like lewis and clark mapping the new world a parent can use the general outlines of their childs psychological terrain to help their child navigate their amazing journey through life some kids have lots of mountains others deep rivers others beautiful self sustaining deserts islands or urban landscapes others may have a mixture of many terrains an ocean view from a bustling boulevard other kids might seem more drawn to outer space
4201111 mlle kiddie doesnt believe in astrology just as she doesnt believe in french or mandarin chinese
4201112 she feels its a symbolic language that can help describe certain aspects of a childs personal map of the heavens an engaging way to activate the right brain
4201113 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4201114 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4201115 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4201116 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4201117 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4201118 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4201119 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4201120 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4201121 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4201122 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4201123 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4201124 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4201125 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4201126 reprocessing of spent fuel will not be cost effective in the foreseeable future
4201127 quite apart from the department of energys gnep activities areva is evaluating establishment of a commercial used fuel recycling center in the u s current projections suggest that construction could begin as early as 2013 with receipt of used fuel in 2017
4201128 project specific proposals for the siting construction and operation of a nuclear fuel recycling center an advanced recycling reactor and an advanced fuel cycle research facility
4201129 the success of gnep will be judged on the quality of research it produces not on the number of national laboratories it supports
4201130 reprocessing of u s spent fuel would cost 25 percent more than plans for direct disposal
4201131 olen eritt in tyytyv inen koko yleisvaikutelmaan max oli todella energinen ja otti minut mukaansa se tuntui hyvin pirte lle ja oli jopa v h n liiankin kuuma
4201132 rata oli muuten rikkeet n mutta meille tuli yksi virhe laukanvaihdoissa joka toisessa askeleessa viimeisess vaihdossa oma keskittymiseni hieman herpaantui

4201135 the spread between overnight rates and libor rates has continued to widen this is a sign that the financial system is still stressed and it needs additional measures
4201136 because of that i wonder if it will be the start of a series of changes it will be interesting to see if they up the amounts available next month
4201137 demand stays strong for fed based liquidity but the positive is that having these facilities in place means that funding volatility should dampen
4201138 its an overflow of problems that have occurred in the subprime space into prime
4201139 refinancing that avenue is almost shut down if distressed borrowers cant sell the only thing they can do is default
4201140 in an environment of falling home prices and limited refinancing opportunities loans with these characteristics have shown a high propensity to default
4201141 prime jumbo borrowers traditionally had more equity in their homes but in many areas with high concentrations of jumbo borrowers home prices have fallen so far that much of that equity has been eroded both reducing borrowers incentives to make payments and their refinancing options
4201142 the combination of tighter lending standards and reduced equity means that many borrowers couldnt qualify for a new mortgage of the same type as their current one
4201143 the absolute level of defaults is still very low and the lack of refinancing options means that bondholders could benefit from slower than expected mortgage prepayments

4201166 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4201167 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4201168 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4201169 while some of them live paycheck to paycheck our customers represent broad income segments and they are all challenged today when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation and health care and core food items there is a great deal of pressure on the customer
4201170 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4201171 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4201172 my wife forget it shes on the floor in tears
4201173 the recommendation right now is for the children to stay where they are because where they are is safe
4201174 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4201175 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4201176 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4201177 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region
4201178 ik ben tot de conclusie gekomen dat ik het gevecht tegen dat beeld beter aankan als ik mijn kamerlidmaatschap neerleg ik heb graag mijn handen vrij
4201179 ik moet constateren dat dit nieuwe zeer ernstige gegeven mij in de beeldvorming verder terug de jaren tachtig heeft ingezogen

4201209 rising costs continue to hit customers hard and they are looking to tesco to help despite clear inflation in some food products we have worked hard to cut our prices week after week and negotiated some fantastic deals with our suppliers to bring shopping bills down

4201228 remember that lady that was talking to you before she was your reaper and she popped your soul out before the brutal impact of your horrible death consider it as a courtesy before you die
4201229 this isnt fair i havent done shit why do i have to die im only 18 years old im im too goddamn young to die i have to go back to work and pay my share of the goddamn fucking rent

4201253 the catalyst fund meets an important need in the community development field
4201254 it will look beyond real estate and housing development to finance organizations expanding their innovative activities in sectors such as workforce development education and access to healthy foods among others financing for these activities often is difficult for organizations to obtain
4201255 the living cities catalyst fund will play a key sector building role
4201256 many foundations are exploring the use of pris to advance their agendas the fund is an excellent vehicle for new pri makers enabling them to invest alongside the institutions that pioneered these investments and create a pri portfolio without having to build specialized staff to underwrite and monitor individual investments
4201257 living cities is about making markets work for underserved urban communities and their residents the fund will bring new capital to cities by providing a convenient vehicle for philanthropic investors who care about cities and in turn enabling organizations to expand their impact on the ground and leverage additional investment

4201299 generally the forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4201300 really there has been no air activity and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4201301 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4201302 the air corridors are open for us to take the humanitarian supplies in
4201303 they appear to be withdrawing their forces back towards abkhazia and back and to the zone of conflict toward south ossetia
4201304 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4201305 well first of all i think we need to take this in sequences getting the russians back inside the zone of conflict and then back inside abkhazia and south ossetia it seems to me is the first objective
4201306 whether they russian forces stay there how long they stay there and so on is as best i can tell a subject that will be negotiated

4201308 the target audience is anyone with an interest in water quality as it relates to animal health including veterinarians livestock producers wildlife managers conservationists regulatory officials extension educators and others
4201309 the last concerted effort in the united states to summarize the literature regarding water quality for animals was conducted in the early 1970s by the national academy of sciences nas
4201310 that was a good study well done but there has been much research conducted around the country since then
4201311 it was our absolutely best effort in compiling all of the relevant information available at this time on toxicants in water
4201312 its the same information others would find if they had a month per toxicant to dig through the literature
4201313 there is a lot of misinformation on the web relating to water quality and animals which has made it difficult to separate truth from fiction
4201314 a lot of misinformation has been cited and then recited and recited

4201318 there wont be anything even close to normality with gazas border crossings
4201319 there is a growing frustration among the population because they cannot feel the dividend of the truce on their daily life
4201320 we expected the crossings would be open the siege would be lifted and we would have a life and none of that happened
4201321 we chose closings as a nonviolent response to the violations of the quiet
4201322 so thats what im going to be focusing on over the next three days
4201323 when i looked at the board i thought wow i just did it
4201324 i was going to improve my time a bit more but i guess that to win this race is more important than to set a good time
4201325 i cant swim faster than kosuke but it could have been possible to get a better result
4201326 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others
4201327 we swam together and i felt like we were training
4201328 i have always focused on a period of four years and to go any faster it would be impossible
4201329 ive won it twice the most prestigious event im happy ive done that
4201330 its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team
4201331 maybe if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4201332 he didnt play his best today but i felt like i served well when i needed to especially in that tiebreaker
4201333 after the athens games i wanted to retire from the national team because i thought i was in very good shape back then
4201334 if i couldnt win a gold then i thought i could never get a gold my coach huang yubin kept on encouraging me he took me on a vacation and told me that the 2008 games would be the greatest chance in 100 years and i should have a try at it he kept pushing me and then he kicked me to the highest position on the podium
4201335 its very special and even in my dreams i never said i would have a bronze medal
4201336 after so many years of competition especially in all around theres no more outside pressure that can influence me
4201337 today the reason i couldnt get on the podium was because of my landings
4201338 unlike the team events my landings werent coming off today
4201339 today i stepped up my defense greece likes to run the pick and roll and we prepared for that
4201340 we ran the break the right way we got stops when we were supposed to get stops
4201341 we just put it all together we are starting to realize when we can make our move
4201342 they knew what to do to take us out of our game
4201343 i have a collection now i have a gold a silver and a bronze
4201344 mishin was the world champion so beating him is an impressive feat
4201345 the gold medal is what we came to get to go back with a bronze is good but its not what i came to get
4201346 i prepared for a hard war psychologically i got enough preparation to fight against park
4201347 the rain affected me a little bit but we train a lot in the rain we even train in the cold rain but its disrupting a little bit
4201348 you figure if the first arrow doesnt go in the gold youre unsure if you should touch the sights or not i actually shot really well with the way i feel it just wasnt meant to be i guess

4201395 these creams we tested have tumorigenic tumor causing capability activities
4201396 i need to emphasize that what we have done is only in mice we dont know what the implications are for humans but it does raise a red flag that this is something that should be considered
4201397 we took out a couple of ingredients and made a cream that turned out to be non tumorigenic
4201398 we really dont know what ingredients in these creams are doing that
4201399 there is a need to have the various companies test their creams to see whether or not there is a problem
4201400 i am sure there are creams on the market that do not have tumorigenic activities and some of them may have anti tumorigenic activity
4201401 certainly the issue here is to protect yourself from that degree of continuous uvb induced priming for skin cancer by practicing good sun protection and sunscreen use in the first place
4201402 these moisturizing creams might act as an irritant or a promoter of skin cancer in mice skin but extensive study is needed before we advise people that their commonly used moisturizers can cause skin cancer

4201434 taking on a new role as a married woman and a new identity as a sexual human being
4201435 educating a couple to take their time experience sexuality and intimacy rather than view it as a performance or a test or as a task you either pass or fail often takes the pressure off

4201502 en la pr ctica ello implica que el ministerio de la defensa podr adelantar labores de inteligencia y contrainteligencia sin ning n tipo de control tal como figura en el art culo 4 de la nueva ley se trata de una norma abierta desaparece la coletilla de conformidad con la ley eso es muy peligroso porque hasta el gobierno hab a convenido en la necesidad de evitar excesos cuando se invoca la seguridad del estado para justificar la intromisi n oficial en la vida privada de los ciudadanos
4201503 en ese momento el objetivo era obstaculizar las manifestaciones p blicas contra el gobierno mediante la restricci n del derecho al libre tr nsito pero la ley con la cual se regul la materia incluye sanciones que alcanzan la prisi n hasta por diez a os por ejemplo ah est el caso del general carlos alfonso mart nez
4201504 un funcionario p blico no se podr a negar a este tipo de labores so pena de perder el trabajo de esta forma el servicio militar no ser a tan voluntario

4201518 vielleicht kommen wir zu dem ergebnis das ist zu eng mit einer stimme mehrheit oder wir stellen fest dass die linke nicht zuverl ssig ist
4201519 primeiramente temos que nos concentrar no atl tico mg o primeiro desafio que teremos pela frente mas claro que temos que fazer proje es mesmo garantindo que o fluminense n o ser rebaixado com 44 pontos um time escapa do risco de rebaixamento e por isso vamos precisar de mais 28 pontos ou seja m dia de um e meio por jogo logo o empate ser quase sempre ruim para n s s vai servir em um jogo muito complicado fora de casa ou num cl ssico muito disputado
4201520 ainda tenho mais uns dias antes da partida e ainda cedo para fazer qualquer tipo de progn stico vou continuar trabalhando com empenho
4201521 wir w rden gerne lustig weitermachen und zum schluss zeigen wir ihnen ja immer noch mal die spektakul rsten bilder des tages

4201527 from august 1 10 i will transfer 3 000 to a neutral account in sl this account will be nothing more then an avatar that then will pay out the money to the people
4201528 the only thing i feel towards steffen cris and certainly banker jenkins another manager is utter scorn they made a promise to refund us beginning in august one month in advance and havent kept their promise that shows that their word cannot be trusted at all
4201529 there was a 6 year old child who was subjected to the sort of obscenities you wouldnt want a 6 year old to hear
4201530 theres a salacious smutty side to this case but its not about sex its about allowing your neighbors to have a normal decent life without being disturbed
4201531 as part of the reinstatement review he was given an opportunity to submit any relevant information he would like to provide he was asked to do that by this friday if he chose to do so
4201532 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4201533 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4201534 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4201535 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4201536 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4201537 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4201538 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military
4201539 al manar and its partners and affiliates form a recognized arm of hezbollah

4201552 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4201553 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4201554 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4201555 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4201556 a clean and green filled neighborhood full of quirky cool independent shops and cafes and whatnot with none of the smog or crime or traffic or industrial ugliness that used to chase all the cultured educated middle class people away from the inner city to begin with
4201557 the big project that opened the city dwellers eyes as to what kind of squalid nightmare the suburbs have become since its never talked about on the news and theres never any reason for city dwellers to actually go there

4201565 desde luego es algo que nosotros bajo ning n concepto vamos a tolerar porque es el presidente del gobierno de espa a

4201573 it is a red light telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water
4201574 algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in water quality

4201578 we see them generally complying and moving back to a position where they can make their exit
4201579 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
4201580 it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4201581 we will support any decision made by the people of south ossetia and abkhazia

4201589 i had a sense of what this meant to him
4201590 he has worked hard to establish an identity as an oriole but he did tell me it felt good
4201591 each time out he is making a statement establishing himself as a legitimate top of the order starter in either league i think hes still got some upside
4201592 im feeling confident and have a deal of gratitude for progress

4201596 twenty years on from piper alpha we must learn key lessons to ensure that failures of basic systems do not lead to major incidents

4201598 in striving to further reduce its hydrocarbon releases the industry will be seeking close engagement with technical staff at hse to further analyse the releases that have occurred and identify where action should be targeted
4201599 the most disturbing aspect of the report is the failure to reduce the number of releases of hydrocarbons which have the potential to turn into a major disaster and the industry needs to redouble its efforts to tackle them
4201600 this is a very damaging report underlining the importance for the industry of addressing the very real problems
4201601 the concerns raised by the hse are clearly serious and we must now see a substantial and speedy response from the industry there can be no room for complacency or compromise on issues which essentially come down to life and death
4201602 we continue to be concerned at the failure to reduce the number of hydrocarbon releases together with an increase in the number of major injuries
4201603 with the demand for oil and gas so high and with assets being worked beyond their original intended lifespan it is more important than ever that the offshore industry continues to invest to protect its workers and put safety first
4201604 the industry cannot afford to be complacent and faces a difficult task if it intends to achieve its current aim of being the safest offshore sector in the world by 2010 and will need to make significant improvements in hazardous incident performance

4201634 we all want what is best for our children and part of growing up smart is encouraging children to be active
4201635 there are plenty of things for children to do besides playing basketball in the street
4201636 we are trying to remove the poles not the children
4201637 the mailbox does not encourage children to play in the street
4201638 you have to specify what it is that is a violation and what the penalty for the violation by ordinance and it still hasnt been done so at least in my view no matter what anybody did between when this charter was enacted and the present day they get a pass
4201639 and then they are checked and corrected by a court which then decides if there is anything wrong with the underline process under the old process impeachment simply required a two thirds vote and you kicked someone out of office without any review and that probably allows politics to come into play too much
4201640 he wanted as many people at his funeral as his father had because then he would know he had lived a good life

4201642 right after he first became ill he said ive lived a good life
4201643 he didnt necessarily want to be remembered as a mayor or doctor but as somebody who was a friend to everyone the kind of man who was kind and generous and respectful
4201644 he was a hit with dad a hit with patients and a hit with us
4201645 he spends a lot of time with patients isnt into a lot of fancy frills and having assistants do everything for him and he handles dads patients with the utmost grace

4201691 the marketplace is looking forward to the fact that energy and commodity prices have come down substantially
4201692 that should bring the year over year number down a bit

4201710 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4201711 we feel at the moment a greater concern for our safety
4201712 thats why every installation of the western world on the polish territory has its meaning because it anchors poland more deeply to the west
4201713 it seems that the americans have changed their view due to the situation in the caucasus
4201714 in the eyes of washington this conflict has proven that russia isnt a stable partner and continues to consider its international surroundings as its exclusive sphere of influence
4201715 with russian tanks rolling into georgia theres a feeling among former eastern bloc states that the tanks could roll over their borders too
4201716 our arguments about the need for a permanent presence of us troops and missiles on polish soil have been taken seriously by the american side

4201723 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
4201724 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u

4201751 sederhana saja kalau kakao berhasil kita kembangkan maka akan mempercepat proses pengentasan kemiskinan di sulbar
4201752 sistem yang dikembangkan di perbankan kita kan berdasarkan model jaminan bukan melihat pada prospek
4201753 jika sebelumnya petani kakao hanya mendapatkan 0 6 ton per ha maka dengan teknologi baru dan bibit baru berupa sistem sambung samping hanya dalam 1 tahun 4 bulan bisa panen relatif cepat dan hasil panennya bisa meningkat 3 4 kali lipat dengan mutu yang lebih baik
4201754 untuk saat ini rata rata baru 110 115 ribu ton per tahun
4201755 saya juga telah meminta kepada pemerintah pusat dan kebetulan sudah mendapat persetujuan untuk memindahkan balai penelitian kakao yang saat ini ada di jember untuk dipindahkan ke sulbar untuk mendukung program itu saya sudah siapkan lahan 15 ha dan anggaran dari apbd untuk melengkapi fasilitasnya
4201756 indonesia sendiri menempati nomor tiga di dunia dalam produksi kakao
4201757 ini peluang besar bagi indonesia dan juga sulbar permintaan demikian besar sementara negara penghasil kakao sangat terbatas nah mengapa kondisi ini tidak bisa kita manfaatkan dengan baik
4201758 saat ini malaysia bisa mengekspor 270 ribu ton padahal mereka tidak memiliki kebun kakao mereka beli itu dari indonesia diolah di malaysia kemudian mereka ekspor
4201759 saya sudah bertemu dengan teman teman pengusaha dari malaysia mereka bilang kalau pelabuhan sulbar telah diperpanjang maka mereka akan langsung beli kakao ke kita dengan harga yang lebih kompetitif sehingga lebih menguntungkan petani kita

4201770 interestingly the effect of infection is different between men and women dr boulter writes in the latest issue of
4201771 infected men have lower iqs achieve a lower level of education and have shorter attention spans they are also more likely to break rules and take risks be more independent more anti social suspicious jealous and morose and are deemed less attractive to women
4201772 on the other hand infected women tend to be more outgoing friendly more promiscuous and are considered more attractive to men compared with non infected controls
4201773 in short it can make men behave like alley cats and women behave like sex kittens

4201786 when the ranking member and i first called for this hearing the purpose was to ensure that all of the facts associated with the capabilities and procurement costs of the ddg 1000 and the capabilities and procurement costs of the ddg 51 were discussed in open session by a variety of expert witnesses we envisioned a hearing that would clear the air of rumor and lay out all the facts without championing any side in the debate much has changed in one months time last week the secretary of the navy and the chief of naval operations announced they would stop the ddg 1000 destroyer class at two ships and re start the procurement of ddg 51 class destroyers predictably this announcement from the navy has generated a firestorm here on capitol hill there are members who are opposed to the decision and members who support the decision there also appears to be significant efforts by certain defense contractors to shore up support for the ddg 1000 and have congress overturn the navy decision
4201787 last week the secretary of the navy and the chief of naval operations announced they would stop the ddg 1000 destroyer class at two ships and re start the procurement of ddg 51 class destroyers
4201788 the ddg 51 is the finest destroyer in the world today a ship that is capable of multiple missions from anti submarine warfare to cruise missile strike warfare to area air defense with its aegis weapons system is the premier workhorse of the fleet and perhaps most important the ship is capable of serving in a ballistic missile defense role which the ddg 1000 cannot do fifty three of these ships are currently in the fleet nine more are in various stages of construction

4201819 its shocking that so many parents wont even be able to borrow money for their kids to go to school in the next few years so many good students wont be able to go and many students will have to drop out unless they know the inside information that the colleges dont want given out
4201820 its not even a matter of getting the best interest rate its getting any money at all these days ive put this workshop together to show parents that college can still be attainable if they learn the inside secrets to getting as much free money as possible and then where to borrow the rest at an affordable rate so they dont go broke
4201821 if the trends continue increasing numbers of potential college students may be discouraged from attending

4201828 the collection of data to control liquid waste sewage in five provinces that is kompong chhnang pursat battambang siem reap and kompong thom was started to be implemented by the ministry of environment for the first time in order to prevent the flow of sewage into the tonle sap lake
4201829 an official of the department of environmental pollution control of the ministry of environment recently said that the collection of data on liquid waste in the five provinces around the tonle sap lake is a task that needs to be clearly implemented
4201830 mr heng nareth the director of the department of environmental pollution control of the ministry of environment said that pollution by liquid waste originates from the citizens houses and from factories and workshops
4201831 he added that it is estimated that waste from factories and from workshops is less than expected that is between 5 and 10 only while the pollution from peoples houses is between 90 and 95
4201832 he explained that the pollution by liquid waste from citizens houses causes damage to the environment of the tonle sap lakes water when the number of persons in populated areas increases from year to year
4201833 the departments officials said that the liquid waste from factories is less in volume and much easier to control than liquid waste from households
4201834 according to estimations from expert environmental officials 70 of the citizens domestic water use goes into sewage and 30 might infiltrate into the ground as for the liquid waste of the five provinces after collection of data on the quantity of domestic water use is completed following soon there will be measures established for cleaning of the sewage water before it is released in order to avoid polluting the natural water of the tonle sap lake

4201843 in the ltte controlled wanni area the tigers have hindered thousands of families from moving to safer places by imposing a strict pass system and in some instances forcing some family members to stay behind to ensure the return of the rest of the family
4201844 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law
4201845 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4201846 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance

4201850 and i said a hundred times you cannot bomb knowledge so there is not really much to bomb and if you do then you turn the iranian drive or you put it in high gear for developing a nuclear weapon we know that if you jolt a countrys pride all the factions right left and centre will get together and try to accelerate a program to develop a nuclear weapon to defend themselves thats classic strategic thinking in any country whether its a democracy a theocracy whatever there is a fundamental choice people need to make which is either you understand that there is a limit to military power that these issues mask a sense of insecurity or even competition for dominance or influence but force is not the appropriate means to address these issues or you go for the military option and then either youll have a repeat of north korea or you have a repeat of iraq and these are not our greatest achievements as civilized human beings
4201851 if you create an environment in which iran feels isolated in which iran is subject to further sanctions then some of these worst case scenarios could take place because then you would put the hard liners in the drivers seat you would make the country feel more and more insecure and then some of these scenarios could happen if there is another narrative based on engagement based on dialogue based on reconciling differences based on stabilizing iraq stabilizing lebanon opening up a trade agreement with the iranians based on providing them with nuclear technology western technology as the six party offer tabled last year by eu foreign policy chief javier solana on behalf of the uk france germany the us china and russia promises then this progression could be quite different because first of all iran would not necessarily fear that they would be attacked
4201852 iran sees enrichment sooner or later as a strategic goal because they feel that this will bring them power prestige and influence they feel that this will bring them into the company of some of the large and influential states the 12 13 countries with enrichment processing even if they dont have a weapon and to change that perception you need to then to look into the whole regional and global security position because unfortunately a lot of that is true a nuclear capability is a nuclear deterrent in many ways when you see here in the uk the program for modernizing trident which basically gets the uk far into the 21st century with a nuclear deterrent it is difficult then for us to turn around and tell everybody else that nuclear deterrents are really no good for you it does not increase your security because all the weapon states without exception are either modernizing or thinking about developing new weapons not only for deterrence purpose but actually usable ones statements have been made during the last couple of years about possible actual use such as mini nukes bunker buster so the environment is do as i say not do as i do and that is not sustainable
4201853 perhaps no other concert space so clearly illustrates the swift effects of gentrification just as bohemian culture in greenpoint and williamsburg is having its most visible celebratory moment it is being bulldozed out of the neighborhood rows of gleaming luxury condominiums have sprung up alongside the park and the tattoo and skinny jeans set is getting priced out that mccarren pool will be filled with water again has pleased many longtime residents and activists but at several recent concerts the prevailing opinion was bummer

4202307 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4202308 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4202309 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head back and saw big flames

4202327 the government has never offered to settle the cobell vs kempthorne lawsuit at any price
4202328 every proposal made by plaintiffs and by mediators to settle the case has been rejected by the government
4202329 oh yes and it also included provisions to deny indians any right to bring any future lawsuits for future mismanagement no matter how egregious
4202330 this proposal was universally condemned by everyone not associated with the government including a wide range of native leaders
4202331 never went beyond conceptual testimony to the senate indian affairs committee and it contained no specific amount to settle the cobell litigation
4202332 this is not an offer instead it is a slap in the face for every individual with trust fund litigation
4202333 lawyers for the justice department and the interior department have made clear throughout the cobell litigation that the governments firm position is that the individual indian money iim trust is not a real trust and that indians are owed nothing no matter how much money and other assets are missing or have been looted from the trust
4202334 the position of the cobell plaintiffs has long been that we will consider reasonable offers from the united states to resolve this case

4202336 i am on cloud nine since ive gotten the gold
4202337 i was so nervous it was my first olympics and i wanted to really perform well because i had three other guys that were depending on me to swim fast but all the preparation all the training that ive done prepared me for it
4202338 i had cpr done and i came back and i was like whats next it didnt even faze me
4202339 i was devastated to see that blacks and hispanics are almost three times more likely to drown than their counterparts

4202343 even if no else was there hed be in there practicing smith said
4202344 watching how passionate he was about it got me into swimming he was a great role model always trying to help someone out
4202345 he was already talking about making the olympics when he got here st

4202355 rising commodity prices and financial speculation on food are not new phenomena the 1970s saw a similar rise in commodity prices in the united states and in the 1920s u s investors formed commodity pools to bet on commodity price movements but the quantity and liquidity of money flowing through todays global markets is unprecedented in human history the current commodities boom could be a sign of looming agricultural scarcity or it may prove to be a short lived speculative bubble that will deflate over the next few months or years but regardless of where agricultural commodity prices are headed the boom has already begun to transform how food is financed grown and sold and may dramatically change how people around the world eat or dont
4202356 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4202357 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4202358 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4202359 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4202360 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4202361 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4202362 the operating theory behind the war on terror which involves massive us intervention in central asia to control vital resources fragment russia and surround manufacturing giant china
4202363 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4202364 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4202365 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4202366 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4202367 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4202368 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4202370 i think youll find that this is the real deal barrows said of the alleged discovery
4202371 just nine months before the beijing olympics the chinese governments news agency xinhua reported that gymnast he kexin was 13 which would have made her ineligible to be on the team that won a gold medal this week
4202372 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4202373 i dont think that the roll call would necessarily be that productive
4202374 as long as it is a symbolic act designed to recognize her accomplishments then i think it is a good thing
4202375 we will pool our talents and leverage already established friends of the family organizations to launch a grass roots and grass tops effort to register women voters organize a national get out the vote effort around womens issues
4202376 our long term goal is to cultivate and groom women to run for public office at all levels of government including the presidency
4202377 the first order of business for our group is to persuade candidates for the presidency senate and house to incorporate a number of womens rights goals and policies into their platforms
4202378 one womens rights issue conspicuously missing from our list abortion
4202379 its not that the new agenda doesnt view choice as a central womens issue its that roe v wade has been used a single defining issue to hold women voters hostage in the past there are many other issues that are important and relevant to a broad spectrum of women
4202380 although several names were put on a to do list chris matthews was our unanimous choice as the worst offender on womens issues therefore the first person on whom we will focus
4202381 there was enough brain power in that room to do just about anything we are looking to help the women of our country who often have no voice we are hoping to make life better for women in all walks of life
4202382 increased end user awareness and ongoing advances in technology are helping shape better products and services
4202383 with its ability to proactively manage change with an understanding of the impact on delivery of business services nova brings new improvements in how data center automation is being performed
4202384 we are proud that network products guide has distinguished nova as best data center automation tool for 2008
4202385 todays data centers have too many different point tools managing individual silos of it operations nova was developed to work in conjunction with existing management platforms and automatically normalize change and configuration data across all it silos enhancing network security enforcing continuous compliance of mandates and improving the delivery of it services
4202386 with the recent first shipments to the u s of our exciting new coco convertible we have turned a new page in kandis development in relatively short order we expect that the manufacturing and sales of super mini autos will become our largest business bringing a new growth dimension to the company
4202387 we continue to believe that barring any delays in production or shipping strong consumer interest in our off highway super minis will translate to sales of the new coco convertible in a range of 5 000 to 10 000 vehicles before year end and at a sales price to kandi of approximately 4 000 per vehicle upon delivery this should translate to a contribution of at least 20 million in new revenues to second half and full year results
4202388 given anticipated margins on these sales of up to 30 we expect that overall gross margins in 2008 will exceed the margins achieved last year of 21 5
4202389 we expect continuing growth in our atrv sales in a range of 10 to 20 with a continued concentration on building fewer overall units of more high end vehicles which offer higher margins in this regard we expect to see a boost in sales from our two new utv models for agricultural use
4202390 we have not yet factored into our guidance an anticipated contribution from our newest product line the tt three wheeled motorcycle which offers higher levels of safety and superb mileage with its expected launch in the current quarter it has already generated considerable excitement from our distributors who have seen a dramatic climb in motorcycle imports over the past year
4202391 we fully expect dramatic increases in the sales of our super minis to u s consumers hungry for more exciting fuel efficient cars especially as we add electric powered and gas powered hard tops to the line in the not too distant future
4202392 supporting the renovation of memorials such as the ville de saint georges cenotaph is one way that our government remembers our service men and women
4202393 this contribution will ensure that this cenotaph remains a place of remembrance and reflection for future generations
4202394 we have a responsibility to honour the brave men and women who fought so selflessly on behalf of our country
4202395 in saint georges these renovations will make the cenotaph more accessible for people paying tribute to those who have served

4202401 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4202402 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4202403 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4202404 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4202405 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4202406 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4202407 our results for the quarter demonstrate our ability to manage to the bottom line in a challenging and uncertain economic environment yet we have continued to make progress in strategic areas such as the roll out of our higher margin finance and accounting service offerings with the launch in march of our new york area consulting operations and the signing of two new cpa firms to our partner on premise program in april and may
4202408 the significant strengthening of our balance sheet provides us with a much more secure position as we await improvements in the overall economic environment we have also demonstrated our ability to act proactively by aggressively seeking reductions in operating costs throughout the organization as demonstrated in the reduction of our selling general and administrative expenses in the current quarter we are excited to have been able to produce these results in our first full quarter as an otc bulletin board traded company
4202409 bloggers and wine bloggers in particular have become among the most powerful voices in america when it comes to discovering new places new ideas and to defining the trends and conversations

4202451 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4202452 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4202453 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4202454 rather you are the miserable one son of the broken one shaqii ibn qusayr
4202455 i will cause you to change in this world with a blazing fire
4202456 had i known that that was in your hands i would have taken you as a god
4202457 and what do you say about muhammad sallaallahu alayhi wasallam
4202458 he is the prophet of mercy the imam of guidance may the peace and blessings of allah be upon him and the messenger of the lord of all that exists sent to all of mankind with a good exhortation
4202459 and what do you say about ali bin abu talib
4202460 had i entered it i would have seen its dwellers
4202461 each person is held ransom for only that which his own hands have reaped
4202462 i am required to be accountable only for the affairs of my own soul
4202463 the one whom the creater allah azawajal is most pleased with
4202464 the knowledge thereof is with the one who knows their secrets and their private discources
4202465 and what kind of a man will i be on the day of resurrection
4202466 i am too insignificant for allah to reveal to me the unseen world
4202467 to the contrary i said what i said because i did not want to lie to you
4202468 and how can a created being laugh when he was created from clay which is consumed by fire
4202469 then what is the matter with us that we laugh
4202470 have you ever seen any form of entertainment i e musical instruments
4202471 by allah after what i have seen here i will never eat to satiety quench my thirst or wear nice clothing and i will continue to remain in a state of sadness
4202472 o hajjaj by allah that is the sadness i am referring to as for this blowing instrument it reminded me of a tremendous day the day on which the trumpet will be blown as for the lute a tree was wrongfully cut for it to be made and as for the strings they are from the bowels of sheep which were wrongfully slaughtered since they werent slaughtered for food or any beneficial use but rather for forbidden entertainment they will be resurrected with you on the day of resurrection
4202473 no one goes to his lord until he knows how he ranks with him
4202474 and how is it possible that i will not go to my lord as i am today i e dignified as he deemed himself to be
4202475 i am with the imam of the jamaah the main body of muslims while you are with the imam of division and al fitnah trial or tribulation the source of discord
4202476 nor am i pleased with the trials or tribulations but the decree of allah azawajal is executed nothing can prevent it from being executed
4202477 what do you think about that which we are gathering for the leader of the believers
4202478 i have not seen what it is that you are gathering for him
4202479 if you use what you gathered to purchase safety from the greater terror on the day of resurrection then that is fine otherwise
4202480 nothing that is gathered for the world is good other than that which is good and purified
4202481 then you consider our action of gathering this wealth good and pure
4202482 and you know better whether it is good and pure i e whether you have procured it through lawful means
4202483 would you like to have something from it i e from this treasure
4202484 the destruction that you have invoked upon me is reserved for those who are sent away from
4202485 choose o said the method in which i will kill you
4202486 for by allah whatever method you use to kill me allah will kill you in the same manner in the hereafter
4202487 as for you you have no exoneration and no excuse for what you do
4202488 i became amazed at your temerity and brazenness in your dealings with allah which is contrasted by his forbearance and leniency towards you
4202489 turn him so that he does not face the qiblah
4202490 i make you bear witness o hajjaj that none has the right to be worshipped but allah alone and he has no partner and that muhammad is his slave and messenger
4202491 i keep these words with you in safekeeping o hajjaj until you meet me on the day of resurrection
4202492 o allah do not give him the power to kill anyone after me
4202493 what is it between me and said bin jubair whenever i want to sleep he takes me by the leg to prevent me from sleeping

4202665 i found that the day after my first matches i had lost four and a half kilos since i arrived here
4202666 i was struggling not so much with the heat but because i didnt prepare for the matches as well as i should have done after all the flying and stuff which was unprofessional on my part again its something i have to learn from and make sure it doesnt happen again
4202667 ideally i would have liked to get here earlier normally i weigh myself before the start of each tournament which i should have done here instead of the day after my match because i need to make sure that im maintaining my weight and not getting too dehydrated and that im eating well enough
4202668 if you do that you might still be tired or not at your best on the court but at least you have given yourself the best chance to do well

4202675 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4202676 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4202677 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4202678 now many of their estuaries and coastal seas are suffering the same malady

4202691 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4202692 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4202693 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4202694 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4202695 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4202696 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4202697 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military

4202703 while the city and county of denver does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests during the convention it is obligated to plan and prepare for that possibility given the volume of people anticipated to attend and the intention of some organizations to deliberately get arrested
4202704 we dont want to get arrested thats not part of our plans
4202705 we dont want to give people intent on being disruptive the opportunity to be disruptive
4202706 they tried to keep it quiet until they got caught
4202707 it was always known there would be a need for increased capacity and after those decisions were made there would be a community outreach component
4202708 we dont anticipate widespread arrests but the city has an obligation to plan for that possibility
4202709 in that planning weve taken into account the concerns of the aclu and the groups they represent

4202722 we now have a capability of someone to radicalize themselves over the internet
4202723 they can train themselves over the internet they never have to necessarily go to the training camp or speak with anybody else and that diffusion of a combination of hatred and technical skills in things like bomb making is a dangerous combination
4202724 those are the kind of terrorists that we may not be able to detect with spies and satellites
4202725 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
4202726 all americans should be ashamed of themselves we all let this happen
4202727 why is it that we consider free travel and association such basic rights but draw the boundary literally at the national level
4202728 never mind kip an exercise for one and all look at the image look this is the man really driv
4202729 look at all my trials and tribulations sinking in a gentle pool of wine dont disturb me now i can s
4202730 hey they do once you get enough of them working on each other is this an unpredictable robot
4202731 and it was the republicans who wielded the knife you know even if ms
4202732 weird i put one up and it didnt post here it is again just to be extra tricky one of the words

4202737 we have worked to develop a route and facilities that minimize the impacts on landowners farming operations and the environment on both sides of the border
4202738 we had hoped that the eub would have listened to our concerns
4202739 the wind rushes out of the valleys and as it hits the ridge the higher the ridge the more speed it gains as it goes up
4202740 by reducing the ridge altitude by hundreds of feet you change the wind patterns and therefore impact the wind speed
4202741 taking the wind map in gis software i placed the turbines along every part of the ridge at class 4 or higher wind speeds
4202742 using a spacing of three rotor diameters between turbines i found that 220 turbines could fit along the ridges
4202743 a lot of developers are wary of west virginia because most of the places where they propose wind arent in the coal fields theyre in the non coal producing counties where theres a lot of people with summer or winter homes or ski resorts and theres a lot of opposition
4202744 they know what the alternative is here and they know the community members would prefer a wind farm
4202745 and at the same time they know that they have a lot of support on the ground if challenges do come about
4202746 with the idea of a new sec owned channel now
4202747 there are twin advantages of this proposal first we can save about half of our food grain stocks by catching and eating rats and secondly we can improve the economic condition of the musahar community
4202748 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
4202749 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
4202750 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
4202751 when you add extra nutrients to the sea you get fertilizer effects that are identical to fertilizer effects on land
4202752 you make the land greener you also make the sea greener
4202753 now fish and crabs are getting uncomfortable so they leave worms and clams come up out of the sediment and extend their body parts up to reach oxygen that might be further from the bottom some animals will just shut down lower their metabolism
4202754 this lost biomass could feed 75 percent of the brown shrimp caught in a season thats not a trivial amount we might have more shrimp and they might be bigger
4202755 what we want to do though is refurbish the hubble so that it can operate as long as possible
4202756 were going to add some new instruments and then were going to go in and kind of do internal surgery on some instruments that are already in the telescope
4202757 the whole concept of going somewhere where you dont have a place to shelter like the space station was a little different
4202758 its a very low probability of an event but im glad that theres a relatively robust plan to deal with it if it did happen
4202759 it has answered just so many of those fundamental questions that people have been asking about the cosmos since people were able to ask questions
4202760 i think it will be a pretty special moment for all of us

4202762 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4202763 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4202764 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4202765 the structure 15 metres long and three metres high 49 feet by 10 feet was raised in the middle of the rhone glacier in switzerlands southwestern valais region by 27 students from the german university
4202766 the purpose of the screen which sits at an altitude of 2 300 metres is to keep cold winds over the glacier
4202767 already successfully tested in a laboratory the experiment will be studied on site until august 21 according to the university located in the swiss city of mainz
4202768 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4202769 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4202770 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4202771 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4202772 well equipped persons of arms carrying fighting ability and age being needed to ensure a state of liberty the freedom to possess and walk about with the arms of their choice cannot be legislated curtailed outlawed tampered with or impeded in any way

4202774 the conventions of a number of the states having at the time of their adopting the constitution expressed a desire in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added and as extending the ground of public confidence in the government will best insure the beneficent ends of its institution

4202779 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who amp whose firm are paid to promote a interests of oar nations
4202780 so one must ask whear mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when a issues concern those nations
4202781 a question is who is a client is a adviser loyal to income from a foreign client or is he loyal to a c amp idate he is working for now its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or anoar of a conflict
4202782 after you read a article its astonishing that scheunemann is even still with a campaign amp it just adds to a continuing mystery of how mccain preserves this image of being a scourge of lobbyists when he is almost a caricature of a kind of politician whose conduct is managed by a series of lobbyists who manage his actions on almost every point of policy
4202783 may have used his position in a mccain campaign for his own financial benefit by advancing a interests of his former lobbying client a georgian government

4202823 unfortunate behavior of police has aggravated the situation to enter the houses of the people during the night and try to harass the women and children in some areas in srinagar and hurl abuses in the name of kashmiri leaders gives a clear understanding of the mindset of managers of governors rule
4202824 the dictatorial arrogance of the operator of misrule in kashmir is seriously hurting and further alienating the people
4202825 the sad behavior of police with the media persons and point blank range killing of one young media person two days back has its impact on the functioning of press and media
4202826 we are unapologetic about our role in the amarnath agitation it is the response of the masses due to the accumulation of their grievances if parties supporting upa can plead for organisation like simi why cant we stand with the masses
4202827 we believe that all the contentious issues can and must be resolved amicably based on dialogue and reconciliation
4202828 we will have to desist from giving the forces an excuse and justification to open fire
4202829 kashmiri people have become used to suffer violence and that is why we dont answer violence with violence he said
4202830 the forces rain bullets on unarmed civilians which is the worst violation of human rights
4202831 we will withstand every form of oppression but will not compromise with our movement
4202832 india had not succeeded to suppress our movement with force in the past and could no be able to do so in the future
4202833 dialogue is the only way to resolve the present crisis
4202834 we will launch a jail bharo movement if there is no positive response from the centre to our demands
4202835 we have been raising this issue in a civilized manner for the last two and a half years but today people of kashmir are on roads supporting our demand
4202836 in the current situation the people should themselves guard the hurriyat leaders and stand glued to them whenever they are making a public speech
4202837 lakhs of troops are deployed in the kashmir valley and together with other security agencies have plans to liquidate the hurriyat leadership
4202838 we were too young and foolish to know that what we were doing wasnt how things were done
4202839 look for people with renaissance thinker tendencies whove done work in a related area but not in your specific field ms
4202840 wolff railed that design and designers were incapable of challenging issues or changing minds because their collective arsenal of alternative cliches which has not changed in decades is the same as mainstream ones which they sought to subvert he further admonished the audience against doing anything if the result was not extraordinary instead he said just read books lots of books the thud of 200 plus jaws dropping was audible throughout the audience
4202841 valid and needed criticism from within the field is often seen as tainted by overt prejudices which often results in vituperative argument on blogs and elsewhere so the most constructive aspect of this public critique was the fact that despite wolffs acerbic take no prisoners tone issues were raised myths were challenged criticism did not kill the discourse instead it gave it new life
4202842 teaching then wasnt a method of telling students all about what i knew because the only thing i knew about was design process instead teaching became a way for me to learn and to structure theories processes methods and opinions about design void of the business context teaching is a way to explore
4202843 after viewing the video they demanded that i delete it
4202844 i asked why the head stewardess went as far as to tell me that i had broken a law by using an electronic item during the flight
4202845 i do not even know how to download a video on the internet
4202846 this time they told me that the captain demanded that i delete the video
4202847 if the captain had nicely asked me to delete the video i dont think i would have disobeyed a pilot

4202854 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to
4202855 if one looks at the credentials of skeptics compared to the credentials of defenders of the official line it is impossible to dismiss skeptics as kooks

4202861 we dont act like a married couple we dont attack our kids about them having a gf bf and we dont always argue about stupid things
4202862 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4202863 we will achieve independence in accordance with all of the rules of international law
4202864 the aim of independence has been set and we will move toward it together
4202865 lets ask the american side so that you are convinced of whether the cargo is humanitarian or not

4202867 throughout this experiment i also have to be aware that john actually has a life a family and full time school
4202868 thanks to the help of aid workers like these real progress has been made in improving the lives of the afghan people
4202869 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4202870 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4202871 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
4202872 many thousands of children are alive today thanks to aid work on improving health standards six million children are now in education two million of them girls compared to one million boys with girls banned from schools under the taliban
4202873 in contrast the insurgents have nothing to offer the afghan people other than more killings and intimidation
4202874 where we have a prosecutor and a police officer working together looking closely at the evidence making sure that we target the right people we get better results
4202875 for either application weve go to show sufficient evidence to satisfy a court
4202876 the closer we work together the better we are at putting the appropriate evidence together
4202877 im talking about things like cctv footage evidence of misbehaviour on trains behaviour in pubs outside grounds and of course if people commit criminal offences
4202878 two years ago in the world cup in germany we had 3 000 bans in force
4202879 one of the conditions is people surrender their passports when england play abroad not a single one of those convicted hooligans got to germany
4202880 the end result was the german police policed english fans in a much more friendly way than they might have had to do if they were dealing with hooligans
4202881 for the court to take such extraordinary action on its own indicates the importance the judges place on the case and means that maher may finally see justice in this country
4202882 big potential to expand globally so that should be the focus
4202883 that was not sufficient to offset the losses in terms of low price brands

4202891 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4202892 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4202893 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4202894 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4202907 the ongoing excessive and unwarranted use of force against kashmiri people
4202908 the amarnath issue is not about hindus versus muslims rather its about nationalists versus separatists
4202909 we urge the government to restore the original cabinet order rather than adopt a do nothing policy
4202910 it is with a deep sense of disappointment that i am writing to you with regard to the issue
4202911 the recent events have shown that the people in jammu are now determined to assert in order to claim their fair share in the matter of both governance and development of the region
4202912 there is discrimination in the matter of public employment disbursal of funds and development of region
4202913 they people of jammu are told on each occasion if fairness is shown to the people of jammu the psyche of the valley will be hurt
4202914 there is huge sense of hurt and injury in indian public opinion which has resulted in the nationalist opinion being alienated because the separatists have to be pleased

4203028 i was always taught and believe when you do wrong youve got to pay a price for it
4203029 lord how often shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him up to seven times
4203030 i do not say to you up to seven times but up to seventy times seven
4203031 for this reason the be compared to a king who wished to settle
4203032 so the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before him saying have patience with me and i will repay you everything
4203033 and the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave
4203034 but that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii and he seized him and began to choke him saying pay back what you owe
4203035 so his fellow slave fell to the ground and began to plead with him saying have patience with me and i will repay you went and threw him in prison until he should pay back what was owed
4203036 so when his fellow slaves saw what had happened they were deeply grieved and came and reported to their lord all that had happened
4203037 then summoning him his lord said to him you wicked slave i forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave in the same way that i had mercy on you
4203038 and his lord moved with anger handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him

4203044 if one is born but not saved then yes its better not to have been born i will have no children as i cannot live with the idea that my child might suffer infinite pain for all eternity in gods eternal torture chamber and no word twisting about how god doesnt run hell its there because he lets it exist and if calvinism is right then it is doubly cruel and selfish to have children chances are your progeny will have been created for the express purpose of feeling gods wrath you will probably birth nurture and raise a child whose sole and only purpose is to suffer indescribable torment for ever and ever and ever

4203098 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
4203099 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
4203100 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
4203101 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
4203102 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
4203103 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
4203104 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
4203105 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
4203106 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
4203107 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
4203108 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
4203109 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
4203110 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
4203111 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
4203112 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
4203113 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
4203114 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
4203115 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
4203116 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
4203117 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
4203118 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
4203119 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
4203120 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
4203121 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
4203122 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
4203123 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
4203124 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
4203125 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
4203126 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
4203127 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
4203128 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
4203129 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
4203130 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
4203131 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

4203210 on the risk of stocks in the long run a resolution to the debate
4203211 on the risk of stocks in the long run a comment
4203212 it is obviously quite difficult to predict how much an insurance company would charge for an rcla
4203213 we have developed a theoretical model for valuing an rcla assuming a number of idealized assumptions
4203214 that said we have developed a theoretical model for valuing an rcla assuming a number of idealized assumptions these are the same assumptions that are used to price and hedge widely available equity put options as well as generic life annuities which is why we believe the model values provide a rough indication of what an rcla would cost in reality
4203215 option based cost may appear higher than a simple insurance cost

4203221 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4203222 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4203223 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4203224 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4203225 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4203226 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4203227 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4203228 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4203229 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
4203230 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4203231 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4203232 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4203233 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new
4203234 so the state understands that we local governments are tired of picking up their load and they should be carrying their own load up there weve done it long enough
4203235 its no solution whatsoever its just a continuation of postponing inevitable decisions that the state should make

4203337 on the other hand the evangelical view of this matter is in fact completely absurd and not just absurd in a virgin birth water into wine i believe an angel watches over me kind of way on this view a person who led an entirely exemplary life in terms of his impact on the world would an example help gandhi maybe but who didnt accept jesus as his personal savior would be subjected to a life of eternal torment after his death and were supposed to understand that as a right and just outcome that i think is seriously messed up

4203362 plan to help all canadians be part of the solution
4203363 hi mary anne coleman from sussex i actually dont have a question but i traveled down here today with my daughter and granddaughter and i just want to say how proud i am of you as a canadian and thank you
4203364 how deeply she believed in fighting climate change and how proud she was to see a party bring forward a plan to help all canadians be part of the solution
4203365 how proud i am of you as a canadian and thank you
4203366 and then purposely stacking it with partisan liberal supporters and environmentalists
4203367 paul watson may have lurked in your imagination as a canadian myth someone whose exploits you have heard about but find hard to imagine in flesh and blood paul watson along with many other high profile canadian activists and researchers was a speaker at the people and the planet conference as a whole the conference was inspiring and informative

4203370 i think what a lot of people dont realize is that this man is a terrorist in fact you know to come out with the insensitive remarks for example that he came out with a few weeks ago when these sealers lost their lives and he put their lives below animal lives
4203371 at the same meeting in moncton i was touched by one environmental activist who came up to the microphone we had set up to tell me how deeply she believed in fighting climate change and how proud she was as a leading advocate for carbon pricing to see a party bring forward a plan to help all canadians be part of the solution with her daughter and granddaughter at her side she reminded me what a great image this would make to sell a hike in taxes with the right mixture of positive media coverage green packaging and liberal interpretation i think we will succeed

4203376 ea wants to be the leading sports brand in the world

4203382 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
4203383 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
4203384 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
4203385 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
4203386 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
4203387 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
4203388 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
4203389 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
4203390 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
4203391 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
4203392 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
4203393 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
4203394 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
4203395 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
4203396 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
4203397 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
4203398 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
4203399 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
4203400 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
4203401 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
4203402 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
4203403 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
4203404 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
4203405 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe

4203410 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4203411 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4203412 michael is back in training but i think to be honest manchester united will come a bit early
4203413 its no good trying to kid people he just needs a week in with the group doing all the things he needs to do and were not going to get that into him now so i think its very very doubtful
4203414 it would be crazy on our part to try and short cut it just because its michael owen we treat him the same as any other player
4203415 kk seems pretty certain of a couple more signings but i wouldnt ask who and he wouldnt tell me anyway
4203416 collocini will be unveilled tomorrow he has been training with the first team all week and there was simply problems with his work permit his italian passport had expired which he needed for his work permit his argentinian passport was ok however was no good for the permit i guarantee he will officially be a newcastle united player by tomorrow and may be eligable to play at the weekend guterriez tribunal is tomorrow and hopefully should sort out his registration also

4203418 the theory of reincarnation holds briefly that each individual human soul or essence is reborn again and again in a series of bodily incarnations on this earth learning its lessons and facing the consequences of its actions until it is sufficiently advanced to progress to the next stage whatever that may be
4203419 karma means that a human being is locked into action by the iron law of cause and effect past acts determine the present and the future what a person does now results from past actions and these present actions will determine future actions
4203420 one never gets away with anything for every act has a consequence
4203421 does not explain the world in which we live it is devastating to every level of human existence its arguments have been examined and found to be invalid the life style which arises out of a reincarnational world and life view leads to political economic and sociological disaster it is rooted in the world of the occult which is clearly denounced in the scriptures
4203422 as for his jesus teachings even the gospels make it clear that he distinguished sharply between his exoteric preaching to the masses and his inner teaching to his chosen disciples one interesting occult theory is that he left reincarnation out of his public teaching because his message to the masses concentrated on the transformation of the personality as the immediate step towards perfection and the most they could grasp at the time but that to his disciples he taught the inner truths of the reincarnating individuality
4203423 it was neither that this man sinned nor his parents but it was in order that the works of god might be displayed in him
4203424 if everyone alive today once inhabited a previous human body how can the worlds population explosion be explained
4203425 are not enough former earthlings to account for todays population and each year the problem gets worse
4203426 a reincarnationist must believe that all the victims were simultaneously punished for past sins

4203431 mauers neck wasnt good all night he couldnt really get anything going
4203432 but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as the raiment of those that are slain
4203433 after the product was launched we worked with a cross functional team that included marketing and engineering staff to investigate the feasibility of using more environmentally friendly material
4203434 however we had to keep in mind that not only were we looking for environmentally friendly material but also maintaining the child resistant feature of the current package design so we had to make sure that while we were addressing one concern we were not compromising another
4203435 we transitioned from the polypropylene to a laminated fiberboard design that was more environmentally friendly and less costly
4203436 in addition to redesigning the wallet card we redesigned the patient package insert which was initially printed in a booklet format on an expensive glossy paper we selected a less expensive paper stock
4203437 there are some municipalities that do not have the provision for recycling polypropylene im not implying all municipalities fall into this category however i would imagine that more have programs to recycle fiberboard materials
4203438 what is driving this package are stringent child resistant features and the need to maintain the patient package insert within the wallet design the packaging is designated f 1 the most stringent child resistance cr designation
4203439 balancing all the packs needs is a daunting task it requires considerable testing both in terms of package functionality and performance characteristics and in its machinability on the packaging line materials have to maintain appropriate child resistance while also being easy to open for the patient
4203440 equipment changes to support the redesigned packaging components required factory acceptance testing at our vendors facilities to ensure that the changes specified in our user requirements are achieved by the vendor once the factory acceptance testing was successfully completed the equipment was shipped to our plant in nutley upon receipt the equipment went through extensive site acceptance testing followed by equipment qualification runs prior to use for commercial operations
4203441 as far as the basic wallet machine the equipment frame and drive shaft were extended to accommodate a new vision system and a laser printer in addition we had to redesign the feed mechanisms for the card and patient insert
4203442 in order to successfully accomplish this we had to enlist the support of our component vendors and the equipment manufacturers
4203443 we derived savings primarily from the wallet and the patient package insert material changes with the wallet packs we were able to reduce our cost by approximately 50 percent and with the patient package insert we were able to reduce our cost by approximately 65 percent
4203444 our oee is a key indicator used to measure line performance this in turn highlights the quality and the waste generated during the operation so we saw a significant improvement in our blister packing and cartoning operations when we made these changes we saw a considerable increase in our oee we were operating somewhere between 50 and 55 percent
4203445 now our oee is up to 84 percent we are exceeding our expectations in our boniva packaging operation this is due to people taking ownership responsibility and pride in their particular operation
4203446 we havent received any feedback to my26 knowledge from the consumers or the trade
4203447 we are constantly looking at opportunities to improve our packaging operations and to utilize more environmentally friendly materials that are safe for the consumers roche believes that economic success as well as social responsibility and environmental protection are dynamically interrelated we strive to balance this in everything we do and we look at packaging as an important part of this process
4203448 six sigma was developed at motorola in the late 1980s to provide focus on improvement and help accelerate change in a competitive environment
4203449 we have adopted a lean six sigma approach to address speed quality and cost that drives productivity revenue growth and sustainability

4203485 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4203486 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4203487 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4203488 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4203489 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4203490 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4203491 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4203492 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4203493 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4203494 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected

4203501 the fact remains there are not a lot of food choices in south l a
4203502 our policy makers abhor nuance and the subtle but distinct qualities that differentiate fast food from food that can be served fast
4203503 her assumption is that the people in south l a are incapable of freely making good choices on their own the finger wagging inference is that poor black or latino residents need government to limit their food options or else theyll make themselves sick what goes unacknowledged is the ability of fast food chains to respond to consumers needs in addition to standard burgers and fries these businesses have already added healthier options to their menus and now most offer salads yogurt and fruit

4203520 weve been at the forefront of getting programs operational and weve recycled now hundreds of tonnes of electronics
4203521 there is currently no comprehensive strategy to address electronic waste in federal government operations
4203522 it does not address the end of life management recycling and resource recovery nor encompass the broader range of it equipment
4203523 while we cannot provide an accurate figure at this time we do know that there is a very high volume of electronic equipment generated from canadian federal government operations
4203524 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4203525 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4203526 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4203527 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4203528 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4203529 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4203530 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4203531 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4203532 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
4203533 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4203534 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4203535 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill

4203661 barnabas went to tarsus to look for saul and when he found him he antioch so for a whole year barnabas and saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people

4203675 finally the aclu got the courts to issue an injunction against further construction of the ark saying that since god is flooding the earth it is a religious event and therefore unconstitutional i really dont think i can finish the ark for another five or six years

4203775 people dont think about water as such but it really is a major ingredient
4203776 water can be a vital part of a dish simply because it provides a medium for food to cook in without searing or burning
4203777 meat is packed with water and that water is retained in a network of proteins
4203778 but when you heat those proteins they coagulate thats the equivalent of squeezing a sponge so you force moisture out of the food
4203779 thirst kicks in when a person is approximately one percent dehydrated

4203814 we are thrilled to hear the news taipei zoo has been ready to house tuan tuan and yuan yuan and we believe the two pandas will be well cared for in the zoo

4203820 in the past the heads of the two countries seldom had a chance to talk like this there is a warming in relations between taiwan and panama
4203821 its true that panama sought chinese businesses to invest in the project but torrijos told ma that he welcomed and would invite taiwanese businesses to take part in the expansion plan
4203822 many people hope to see peace and stability in the taiwan strait
4203823 because thats how taiwan can continue to survive and develop and china can continue to strengthen its economy and improve its livelihood

4203830 we do not intend to pursue additional interests at this time
4203831 we just reacted because we didnt have any other option any civilized country would act in the same way i may remind you after september the 11th the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
4203832 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighboring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
4203833 it is not in russias interests to continue to hanker for a soviet past because frankly its gone and its good that its gone
4203834 continuation of the horrifying portrayal of disabled characters in entertainment
4203835 aapd is also disgusted at the use of the word retard numerous times in the movie and promotional items for the film
4203836 both the use of this word and the appalling portrayal of an intellectually disabled character in this movie are incredibly damaging to people with intellectual disabilities
4203837 although the movie is considered satire this depiction of a person with intellectual disabilities is far from funny
4203838 it is a much bigger performance than weve ever put on
4203839 given that we are two troupes we have double the resources of money and talent it also required double the courage this production has taken taiyuan to the next level
4203840 puppet theater in taiwan tends to appeal only to the very old and the very young it does not register with the general theater going public we were looking for ways so that actors puppets and music can occupy the stage together
4203841 a production such as la boite gives us a chance to show off some very traditional performances both of european and taiwanese puppetry as part of a bigger and more diverse show it is not like trying to watch the whole three kingdoms saga
4203842 two companies meet they develop feelings for each other and these feelings are reflected in their performance their individual traditions are given clearer expression through their relationship
4203843 so geht das aber nicht wenn du das n chste mal wechseln willst sagst du mir gef lligst vorher bescheid

4203848 they imposed a very physical game on us with man marking all over the pitch they did that with a lot of belief and spirit
4203849 in the first half they had some chances but in the second half we slowly took over
4203850 they have given so much in the first half they could not keep the same pace and tightness in their marking from then on we looked more comfortable
4203851 i think we should have scored in the first half
4203852 you dont get many chances and you have to take them we didnt do that we lost concentration on two occasions and got punished
4203853 i still dont know we will have to see it on tv because its much easier to see the important thing is we got a result and we have to improve for the second leg
4203854 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4203855 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4203856 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4203857 we cannot continue to grant yens requests again and again or it will not be fair to others
4203858 we will have a strategy by then i cannot say what it will be but there is still time
4203859 around two dozen convicts affiliated with various political and criminal armed outfits in southern nepal have fled

4203862 one of the police community support workers who had seen what was going on then went inside to let them know they were being observed
4203863 i dont know whether they were given the message but not too long after they stopped i personally thought it was funny they were both naked
4203864 the two individuals concerned have been suspended pending a full investigation we do not wish to comment further since to do so would prejudice the investigation
4203865 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
4203866 an assault on the countrys historical respect for the right to privacy and the freedom to be left alone

4203868 earlier this year we had them but because of some business they were called back to their hometowns
4203869 because our religions are different so it is not convenient
4203870 because now its the olympics so we have some more performers
4203871 if you invite some muslims you have to make some special arrangements for them
4203872 look at the way they the kmt campaigned do you believe they only spent this little for all that
4203873 the kmt possesses a great amount of illegal assets to support its candidates campaigns
4203874 the premier emphasized that human resources are the nations only competitive resource
4203875 what we are concerned about was not the score itself but why our high school graduates would score only this high
4203876 this highlights a problem with quality management in higher secondary and vocational education
4203877 the premier believes schools should have a mechanism to manage the quality of their graduates
4203878 the premier emphasized that human resources are the nations only competitive resource poor management of the quality of our human resources could seriously damage our national competitiveness
4203879 some students can still graduate and take part in the college entrance exams after completing their credits even though they perform poorly on academic subjects we may need to adjust part of the regulations
4203880 the commission has stressed the importance of actively responding to the needs of viewers
4203881 and a consensus has been reached that the four television stations will gradually increase broadcasts as teams from taiwan compete in the games over the following days
4203882 the analog channels have to broadcast not only the games but also their entertainment shows and television series to be fair to all the commission cannot require them to broadcast games at specified hours
4203883 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
4203884 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
4203885 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it the club gave me time and i appreciate that
4203886 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
4203887 i knew it was going to be a tough match
4203888 i made a lot of mistakes in the first set
4203889 when the second set began i decided i had to change up i started hitting a lot of heavy balls and lobs and i saw she didnt know what to do with those sometimes you have to win ugly
4203890 in the end of the second set when i was close to winning the match got a little out of hand
4203891 but even after losing the second set i didnt panic
4203892 i have never imagined that i could win gold in the olympic games
4203893 my first thought after i touched the wall was wow ive won an olympic final
4203894 its a new generation and now its time to step aside
4203895 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the no 1 next to my name
4203896 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten
4203897 i think medals mean more than times so thats what im going to be focusing on over the next three days
4203898 we have yet to discover any direct evidence proving that wang chun wei is related to the shootings but we need to find him as soon as possible especially now that he has become a major organized crime figure in the taichung area
4203899 those stateless people or republic of china roc nationals without household registration records who have entered the country to study between may 21 1999 and dec 26 2007 from thailand and myanmar with approval of the government bodies involved and cannot be deported will be permitted to reside in the country by the national immigration agency nia
4203900 while those who have other criminal offenses during the past five years may not be granted residency those whose offenses are related to passport forgery or using other peoples identities for the purpose of entering the country will not be subject to sanctions
4203901 we asked these people to register last month and issued them temporary residency permits that were valid for a year
4203902 you are an ugly woman even by the kindest standards
4203903 this is a victory for all my fellow women it is also a warning to chauvinists
4203904 i have won honor for all archers in china and i believe the future will be brighter
4203905 i dreamed i could win a gold medal every day i was well prepared it was a hard journey but i finally made it
4203906 i shot the last arrow with no hesitation because i was confident
4203907 an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4203908 strengthen competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies
4203909 but he chose me and i agreed to marry him right away
4203910 at least 20 percent of the families on the island have been lifted out of poverty
4203911 we were angry at each other in a quiet way
4203912 a marriage that is not based on love often brings problems
4203913 how can you live happily ever after when you met your husband three weeks before the wedding
4203914 any country will do ill take anyone who will accept me
4203915 we had to work no matter how hot it was no matter how much it rained from 5 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon sometimes we could only afford rice porridge
4203916 its my destiny to be poor if i had another daughter id ask her to marry a foreigner
4203917 taiwanese women want to get married when they are much older and they are also very opinionated
4203918 no one ever came on our trip without finding their dream bride
4203919 they take hundreds of women at a time to a hotel and line them up for the men
4203920 there wont be anyone left for us marriage shouldnt be about money it should be about love
4203921 as to the recent terrorist attacks and whether they have any links with the terrorist forces there is some evidence showing that behind these attacks there might be east turkestan forces
4203922 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
4203923 the result is very good tremendous thats the feeling i was looking for and i really like
4203924 we just pass the ball to him and let him shoot within his range what i do is defend and rebound thats my role
4203925 now we have a chance to qualify for the quarter finals and we will try to do it for our people
4203926 if we keep up our spirit we can fight against anyone including germany and greece
4203927 we cannot choose our opponents we need to beat them when we meet them
4203928 its a must win situation for us if were to make it to the quarter finals
4203929 we know they are a very good team and they have excellent three point shooting
4203930 committed to bringing relief to the common man to steer pakistan out of the current political economic situation
4203931 the objectives of the creation of pakistan can never be achieved unless we eradicate the evils of terrorism extremism and intolerance from our society
4203932 tolerance and forbearance are not only the pre requisites for the successful working of democracy but also the cardinal principles of a just islamic social order
4203933 this is a question of our honor come out of your homes
4203934 i strongly condemn the human rights violation and the suppression on these oppressed people
4203935 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4203936 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
4203937 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
4203938 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
4203939 we work very closely with local authorities we dont work anywhere where we are not wanted
4203940 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people
4203941 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
4203942 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
4203943 cowardly attack yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
4203944 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worthwhile or not
4203945 i can tell you that what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the un is back the un is back to stay
4203946 the first of its kind to be adopted in the country since the 1990s
4203947 we have to be able to move a lot of the investment to the private sector
4203948 our biggest way of improving security is to make sure that young people are employed
4203949 it brings the whole un organization together in partnership with iraq and its people to reduce poverty foster growth and consolidate democracy in our country
4203950 it was just one normal new briefcase that some careless person left behind with newspapers and plastic bags inside
4203951 lots of careless people leave things that could seem suspicious in public places and people worried about security will call the police so far they are just false alarms
4203952 the olympics isnt any ordinary competition theres definitely more pressure
4203953 i didnt play to my full potential but it was good training for me psychologically
4203954 uno de los poderes esenciales inherentes a nuestra tor es su habilidad de
4203955 there is a deep and useful wisdom in this book it is clean courageous and generous reading most good least harm gave me a much greater understanding of how i can live a better life a more conscious life and a more joyful life
4203956 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4203957 today were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4203958 our arguments about the need for a permanent presence of us troops and missiles on polish soil have been taken seriously by the american side
4203959 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4203960 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want were not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
4203961 one battery is just the start once its based permanently in poland that would enable the launch of a modernization program which by 2018 would provide a complete anti missile defense system
4203962 it the bill is not the partys work but it was perceived as if it belonged to the party
4203963 such works should be discussed within the party first it is an ill timed and fatal statement the content is bad
4203964 she sozen put the party in a difficult situation we are going through sensitive times that need caution and ultimate care this is valid for each one of us we all need to refrain from any actions or statements that could create new tensions
4203965 i dont think the critics will be satisfied with such a motion from the prime minister
4203966 he has to show that he favors further liberalization of the country and cares about more than just the rights of the muslim community
4203967 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4203968 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4203969 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4203970 only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
4203971 the very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be
4203972 we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces
4203973 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
4203974 at some time it becomes necessary to choose between supporting this virtual project and real partnership on questions that require collective action
4203975 i dont care about this medal i think the semi final shows that the ruling body fila does not play fair i didnt deserve to lose the system is corrupt
4203976 this will be my last match i came here to win gold and i didnt so i consider it a failure
4203977 i understand his feelings he aimed for gold but was not given a fair chance
4203978 to me this is worth the world i am ecstatic right now i couldnt be any happy

4203998 there has been cost overruns in a number of stadiums currently built around the country but all will be ready in time for the world cup

4204004 to be honest no because castrated chicken was supposed to be the best
4204005 im more interested in doing the works of contemporary taiwanese playwrights
4204006 the mecca of reggae music in the world over the last 10 years
4204007 people are always saying reggae is so underground in taiwan
4204008 a few years ago it couldnt have been any smaller no one even talked about it
4204009 the surfing crowd getting bigger brought people to the beach and the beach culture started to grow among the young people the surf videos they use a lot of reggae
4204010 have over 15 years of experience performing and recording papa dom hosts his own reggae show on radio manila the first radio show like this in the philippines
4204011 i made a lot of changes from the version seen in 2003 the group back then was much smaller i had only five boys this year the group is much better the four leads are so good
4204012 hes really good as the father its a big part
4204013 i changed a lot for armand and marguerite they nikola and misha are big stars in prague dance all the big roles i changed a lot for the big pas de deux because she can do everything i want nikola is unbelievable her technique the drama shes absolutely perfect
4204014 the third act is very hard for the whole company its 30 minutes this year they couldnt do it at the beginning they were so heavy technically out of condition i keep telling them they have to have class every day
4204015 its also hard for the dancers this time because they have never danced with a live orchestra but its good
4204016 to prepare the music was more difficult than the choreography i used music from nine different verdi operas put together for 100 minutes then worked with the conductor
4204017 i have been really inspired by the chairwoman of chieftek precision co miss chen angelika li fen she has really helped a lot with the sponsorship helped a lot in tainan in arranging the performances its important in this society to have private sponsorship she is really setting an example
4204018 you have to package everything if you want to be a professional company
4204019 if we dont build up the professional level the country the society will never support professional theater
4204020 i think its really important for people to support jazz from their own country
4204021 europeans dont care if they sound like charlie parker we use the language of jazz as a base
4204022 european jazz is having no fear of making a mistake the music is so free so fresh
4204023 when they love what i do the love i feel i want to return it
4204024 and me purely in the interest of gender balance you understand
4204025 i much prefer the pownce interface find my profile here
4204026 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4204027 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4204028 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4204029 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4204030 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4204031 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4204032 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military
4204033 its not very often you get to say you beat the no 1 player in the world anytime but to do it at the olympics with usa on your chest im so proud to be part of this team
4204034 maybe if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day

4204039 he is a different bowler he is a very good bowler i have seen videos of his bowling i have been asking my teammates as well who have played him

4204041 i enjoyed my life when i had nothing and kinda like the idea of just being happy with me
4204042 paula wagner chief executive officer of ua has decided to leave her day to day responsibilities and return to her first love which is producing films

4204044 our one day series in india finishes on december 2 so specialist odi players could take part i would not expect that players selected for the test series would be able to take part
4204045 remember the last sweat because that was the right one
4204046 she found a lovely sound she keeps on waiting for time out there
4204047 at other industry meetings its all about what can we do for the association holding the meeting with aapn its about what can they do for us and their members
4204048 our primary goal is networking thats why the first two hours are slow deliberate detailed introductions of everyone there that way the networking starts at the first coffee break

4204051 i contend that we are both atheists i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods you will understand why i dismiss yours
4204052 beyond belief that the bush administration even the bush administration would do such a heinous thing
4204053 surprised even amazed to see how much evidence he had found that points to the conclusion that the bush administration did indeed intentionally allow the attacks of 9 11 to happen
4204054 directly challenges the accepted wisdom about 9 11 which is that it resulted from a breakdown within and among our intelligence agencies ahmed like thompson suggests that the attacks must have resulted from complicity in high places not merely from incompetence in lower places
4204055 the pearl harbor of the 21st century took place today
4204056 will end the way that the attack on pearl harbor ended with the destruction of the system that is responsible for it
4204057 absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor

4204062 im hoping we can get the bugs out sometime before the postseason
4204063 whether we can make that timetable or not really hasnt been determined
4204064 well were working on the whole instant replay situation it didnt need a vote
4204065 im quite satisfied that were trying to get all the bugs out of it itll be very limited in its form as you know im a little reluctant to speak out about it until i know everything is working but we are moving in the right direction
4204066 yogi once said that it aint over till its over so i want to be very careful
4204067 when we do it i want to make sure its very good that its perfect somebody said today that thered only been 16 disputed home run calls this year i shouldnt say only 16 is a lot they may have determined the outcome of 16 games
4204068 we have spent a lot of time doing a lot of checking theyre wiring 30 parks and chelsea in manhattan where the headquarters will be at mlbam ive been over there to look at it and its unbelievable its a lot of fun but theres still work to be done and i dont want to put a date on it lets just say my confidence is growing
4204069 i dont want to put blame on anybody for everything
4204070 but overall the pitching has not been what we hoped it would be it hasnt been as good as we thought
4204071 im not picking on anybody im not mad at anybody
4204072 but verlanders had a tough year you dont count on something like that from a guy like that
4204073 it makes a big difference when you have your horses
4204074 you picture things as butterflies in your hands and you just unfold your fingers
4204075 if i let them put ice in my drinks i d crack it with my teeth
4204076 im going to get my four days and then ill be done with it and then ill be back at cleveland
4204077 its not only me a lot of people get fined and disciplined i want to be playing but things happen
4204078 i need to pay for everything i do thats the way it is
4204079 but i caught a bullpen yesterday so i guess if they need me i can do it in an extreme emergency situation
4204080 i didnt do any throwing or blocking but just receiving went fine it started coming back like old times
4204081 that was the last time i had gear on or anything
4204082 ill keep my fingers crossed that it doesnt but if need be ill get in there and do what i can
4204083 calling the game would have to come from the bench but the rest of it im confident i can at least catch the ball
4204084 its a risk from a standpoint of one day finishing off one day its not a risk for all four days because if something happens we can make a move
4204085 id rather stand pat mitch has done a good job when hes had the opportunity to play
4204086 with the instability right now of how david is feeling day in and day out id rather keep the roster the way it is right now i think he maier gives us more latitude
4204087 theres definitely a lack of focus on what david is swinging at and i think most of that goes back to how hes feeling physically on any given day
4204088 it takes a lot of support from people outside of ripken youth baseball itself
4204089 this is a great experience for the kids they are getting to meet people from all over the world they may never have the opportunity to meet again
4204090 we cant look for something to happen we have to make something happen
4204091 we need to create our own luck its not going to be handed to us
4204092 you worry more about how your team is playing all teams in the last month and a half are going to go through injuries the importance is that we win games then we dont have to worry about other teams
4204093 we have a lot of work to do we have a lot of tough series against tough opponents the rest of the year you cant look at it you just have to plug away and do what you can do if you win every game youll be in the playoffs
4204094 to be quite honest our pitching has been pretty good
4204095 weve had a game here or there where we havent pitched but our pitching staff has done a good job
4204096 you can sit here and say well we should have won this game or we had an opportunity to win that game the bottom line is we didnt win very many games we have to play better in all areas offense defense hitting
4204097 each game we could have won i think in my opinion theres a lot of professionals in here and the guys are still up i think were going to be fine
4204098 i still believe that this team is good enough we have a lot of work to do we have a lot of tough series against tough opponents the rest of the year you cant look at it you just have to plug away and do what you can do if you win every game youll be in the playoffs
4204099 weve got six more with boston six more with tampa bay tampa bay just had some big injuries its there for us to go out and play well and see what we can make of this race
4204100 its not just the bostons and tampa bays that were chasing right now were chasing a whole bunch of teams that are in the thick of things the white sox the twins and the rangers
4204101 you cant sit down at the beginning of the season and punch in numbers and say this is what a team is supposed to do you have to go out there and play i never really look at it and say on paper well do that you play the games for a reason
4204102 la gente que ha sufrido da os emocionales a menudo traduce ese dolor en algo f sico
4204103 hablan por ejemplo de que les explota la cabeza o de un dolor en el est mago es un paralelo muy fuerte
4204104 el sistema de uniones sociales est muy vinculado al sistema de dolor f sico para asegurar que el ser humano permanece conectado de cerca a los otros
4204105 cuando se nos separa de una relaci n o un grupo nos rechaza es muy doloroso agrega as que intentamos evitarlo
4204106 estas personas experimentan mucha amargura y enojo y sienten que su futuro no tiene sentido adem s no pueden adaptarse al dolor con el paso del tiempo como muchas otras personas s lo hacen
4204107 una persona tiene mayor riesgo de morir en los seis meses despu s de que perdi a un ser querido
4204108 a veces hay que ser un poco superficiales para encontrar a esa persona

4204116 this was a cowardly attack on a vulnerable woman the offender stole from his victim caused her to fall and made a swift escape on a bike
4204117 it was however an attack in broad daylight in a busy area if anyone saw the attack or a man matching our description around the area of tesco in hindley at 4 10pm on tuesday i would appeal to them to get in touch
4204118 it would be very synergistic if it were doable however we dont see that the regulatory environment has changed since the last time we made comments on the subject
4204119 we think it would be problematic to try and merge the two companies in the current regulatory environment
4204120 we have made our navigation system run on the iphone it looks good and works very well
4204121 we will have to look more closely to apples strategy before we can say more about what kind of opportunities this will bring us
4204122 leftards with our evil gay agendas our eco terrorists our traitorous failure to
4204123 i tell people dont kill all the liberals leave enough so we can have two on every campus living fossils so we will never forget what these people stood for
4204124 i would have no problem with new york times editor bill keller being sent to the gas chamber
4204125 and if al qaeda comes in here and blows you up were not going to do anything about it were going to say look every other place in america is off limits to you except san francisco you want to blow up the coit tower go ahead
4204126 howard dean should be arrested and hung for treason or put in a hole until the end of the iraq war
4204127 some liberals have become even too crazy for texas to execute which is a damn shame theyre always saying were oppressed were oppressed so lets do it lets oppress them
4204128 we need somebody to put rat poisoning in justice stevens creme brulee thats just a joke for you in the media
4204129 we need to execute people like john walker in order to physically intimidate liberals by making them realize that they can be killed too
4204130 has there ever been a more revealing moment this year
4204131 let me just put this in fairly simple terms al jazeera now broadcasts the words of senator durbin to the mideast certainly putting our troops in greater danger no more needs to be said about the motives of liberals
4204132 these bastards like clark and kerry and that incipient ass dean and gephardt and kucinich and that absolute mental midget sharpton race baiter should all be lined up and shot
4204133 the industry has never seen anything like our new sage series before so it is vital we have the correct team in place from design to production to sales and distribution to bring this exciting new product to market
4204134 both todd and eric have an extensive history within the high end a v market and will play integral roles in making our new sage series architectural and freestanding speaker systems a success
4204135 todd is an industry veteran with a particular knowledge and appreciation of the needs and expectations of the custom installation dealer
4204136 jon herron wisdom audio v p sales and i both worked with todd at madrigal and i also worked with todd at kaleidescape since the three of us already shared a successful professional history jon and i knew todd shared our philosophy regarding the invaluable role of the dealer and their importance to wisdoms success in the ci channel
4204137 ive known eric graul for years and working with him in the past i know what a valuable asset he will be for wisdom audio
4204138 his experience with the production of high end audio components and systems along with his attention to detail will greatly benefit and streamline our internal and external strategies and goals as we bring our new sage series to market and beyond
4204139 madre he llegado tarde para besarte para que con tus manos me bendigas
4204140 era una se ora vestida de negro delgada y pensativa me han dicho que escrib a versos pero nuncal los vi sino aquel hermoso retrato
4204141 mi boca tiembla para definirte porque apenas abr el entendimiento vi la bondad vestida de pobre trapo oscuro
4204142 iguales entre los aracenas y los ram rez y los reyes brillaban con luz oscura los apellidos araucanos olorosos a madera y agua melivilus catrileos
4204143 habiendo apenas aprendido a escribir sent una vez una intensa emoci n y trac unas cuantas palabras semirrimadas pero extra as a m diferentes del lenguaje diario las puse en limpio en un papel preos de una ansiedad profunda d un sentimiento hasta entonces desconocido especie de angustia y tristeza completamente incapaz de juzgar mi primera producci n se la llev a mis padres les alargu el papel con las l neas tembloroso a n con la primera visita de la inspiraci n mi padre distra damente lo tom en sus manos distra damente lo ley distra damente me lo devolvi dici ndome de d nde lo copiaste

4204145 llena de libros de sue os y de poemas que zumbaban como abejas con el indispensable traje negro de poeta delgad simo y afilado como un cuchillo entr en la tercera clase del tren nocturno que tardaba un d a y una noche interminables en llegar a santiago

4204147 weve got people who are vulnerable trying to stay in their home being enticed into an industry that has no controls on it at all at the moment and that is a disaster waiting to happen
4204148 unless something is done to bring this industry into some kind of regulation to get some sort of framework of quality and assurances for people entering into these agreements the kind of security tenure theyre going to get what they are paying and what protection they get against things going wrong we could see a lot more people really finding they are losing out lots of money and still losing their homes
4204149 this line of hdtvs are designed to fit the needs of consumers in an urban living environment with sizes and resolutions specifically tailored for optimum viewing with limited space
4204150 they are designed to look cool in any room and meet the demands of how todays consumers use tvs such as hd gaming in a bedroom watching tv in the kitchen or a movie in the den
4204151 for about the price of one large screen hdtv thats probably too large for any room in your home you can buy three and create your own urban living hd video suite
4204152 the tvs in this series are designed to keep everyone in stride with the todays video technological advances without crippling their accounts
4204153 it shouldnt surprise anyone that bitterly divisive democrats like barney frank dont have anything good to say about republicans fair minded people look at mitt romney and see a strong leader a man of character and integrity who was elected as governor at a time of job loss and recession and who managed to balance the budget all four years without raising taxes and get the massachusetts economy moving again
4204154 its no wonder the massachusetts democrat party wants to change the subject away from americas worst governor
4204155 while mitt romney fought for reform and lower taxes governor patrick has raised taxes and has failed to implement any reform instead of smearing the last governor who fought for fiscal sanity in massachusetts the democrat party should set up a conference call with america to explain to why they were the source of such spectacular failures like john kerry and mike dukakis
4204156 it should be pointed out that mitt romney looks forward to campaigning for john mccain as a supporter of the ticket and not as a member of it
4204157 do what you want but dont expect the man to understand

4204159 there has been a lot of misinformation circulating about plasma hdtvs and longevity and were happy to once again set the record straight on the durability of panasonic plasma
4204160 quite simply our plasma tvs are built to last a very long time as much as 100 000 hours to half their brightness
4204161 high proportion of recommendations of lcd sets is primarily due to retail salespersons lack of knowledge regarding recent improvements in plasma technology
4204162 plasma hdtvs have a very strong track record of exceptional durability and lifespan
4204163 panasonic plasmas have consistently been rated among the best hdtvs available by many of the most respected publications in our industry despite what consumers may hear from misinformed sources plasma is the right choice for educated consumers looking for stunning picture quality and the ultimate big screen viewing experience
4204164 with the digital transition on the horizon and an increased awareness among consumers about high definition consumers now demand blacker blacks faster response times and the billions of colors that panasonic plasma is known for worldwide
4204165 when you also consider the tremendous customer support system behind all of our hdtvs through our exclusive viera concierge program and added features like a tuf display glass panel that can withstand strong impacts a viera plasma hdtv is a partner youll be able to count on for the long haul

4204169 frankly kate im trying real hard not to put you in the hospital
4204170 im the best there is at what i do and what i do is sell accessories
4204171 i hate this place its boring and theres nothing to do and all you do is yell at me and youre a big fat old hippie
4204172 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4204173 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4204174 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
4204175 both camps are whoring themselves out for their own reasons and both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence

4204178 i wasnt thinking about winning two gold medals at the two consecutive olympic games
4204179 what i wanted to do is show my best performance here in beijing
4204180 im glad that i won this race i was going to improve my time a bit more but to win this race is more important than to set a good time
4204181 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
4204182 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others my coach said to me that we will have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best
4204183 the pressure was much less we swam together and i felt like we were in training

4204192 the explicit backstop might buy them enough time to earn their way back to good health
4204193 the best solution is that they manage to muddle through
4204194 at the end of the day if you told mr paulson and federal reserve chairman ben bernanke that two years from now fannie and freddie would be solvent and not tap the government theyd take that over any other option
4204195 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units and auctioned off
4204196 needs to ultimately reduce not increase their role and doing this would put them back in their place
4204197 much more of a risk in the euro zone than in the u s given role of unions in setting wages particularly in germany
4204198 asia has run a very easy monetary policy because so many countries are tied to the u s what might be acceptable to the u s is not the same for asia
4204199 my whole thing is how do we build this into a 3 000 4 000 or 5 000 person event
4204200 you have to let me in im a professional politician i even got elected to congress
4204201 have you ever heard of a stream that was reverse osmosis were eating natural we be drinking natural water
4204202 if we could enhance santa fe water by filtering it in city hall we could start a trend of people abandoning bottled water
4204203 it was more of a verbal commitment not to use bottles at meetings
4204204 its more environmentally friendly and santa fe has such good drinking water
4204205 your food is so good you should open a restaurant
4204206 at that time vegetarian food couldnt have been further than anything mainstream its earnest clumsiness drove fellow zen students to the corner caf where they could eat fluffy pancakes with butter and syrup my job was to tease this counter culture diet into one that was more familiar and appealing yet still remain vegetarian
4204207 cooking sophisticated and delicious food for a public that wasnt necessarily seeking out vegetarian food was quite a challenge
4204208 for me the most pleasing words from our customers were i forgot there wasnt any meat it was so good
4204209 the vegetable menu astonishes even more than the grand perhaps with matcha green tea tapioca with spring peas and apples or morel cannelloni with leek custard and roasted shallots
4204210 even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us
4204211 it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users
4204212 our goal is to provide full two way service with twitter via sms to every nation in a way that is sustainable from a cost perspective talks with mobile companies around the world continue

4204218 00s including freedia and later nobby plus artists like vockah redu chev off the ave
4204219 90s but favored lighter cheerier samples than the ominous ubiquitous
4204220 we got to hear that music in the club because thats what makes the females do all types of dances
4204221 you are too stupid for calling us guys you know you tried it so stop telling them lies
4204222 90s and had a hand in the startup of the cash money label
4204223 im not a woman im not a man im bobby marchan
4204224 you know the reunion that starts with big hugs and warm feelings but ends with arguments and hurt feelings cuz somebody says or does something stupid theres the perfect example the panel that was supposed to educate amp enlighten and pay tribute to the only contemporary new orleans originated genre of music and its colorful characters spiraled out of control
4204225 the music has a lot more to it than just the stigma of being gay or transvestite
4204226 90s wave of popularity there was a lull that allowed the sissies style to take over because of their multiple releases and frequent shows
4204227 when we took a break it was left open for them and now its oversaturated with their style of bounce
4204228 work ya elbows the djs act like they dont have any other music to play its nothing against them its just the only thing i hear now in bounce is gay and its something i dont want my children to hear
4204229 but i hear the same complaint that bounce is gay at the barbershop at the studio everywhere i go
4204230 theyre not ok with a man talking about another man ive seen it turn out ugly you know how people are when they dont understand something
4204231 she would march with her hair done and makeup and people would be yelling and even throwing stuff
4204232 wed be interviewing freedia and thered be some guy in the background just heckling
4204233 i asked vockah how is it being a gay rapper
4204234 im still doing my thing in the street on the mic in the club every week
4204235 and theyre hustling and grinding like me so they hot people new to the music might say that bounce is a gay thing but they dont understand and theres no big contract coming through right now so what are you fussing for we all scraping and scrapping if you get mad at that youre not doing your homework
4204236 you have to transform from an old generation to a new generation freedia and nobby are like an upgrade from katey red and theres really not a lot of bounce artists still doing it and eventually ill probably get to a new level with my music too
4204237 what were trying to do now people like us and 5th ward weebie is reinventing bounce
4204238 and that led a lot of people to say to hell with it they took our style but now were gonna look like copycats
4204239 if theres going to be a town where gay rappers are going to break out new orleans would pretty much be the only place in the world that could happen
4204240 in new orleans theyre more accepting to homosexual music theyve got less prejudices
4204241 theyre providing music for a core new orleans audience that wants uplifting party dance music instead of rap that focuses on lyrical development and narrative
4204242 new orleans people want music that keeps the vibe going not a think about lyrics vibe but a party in the street vibe and its still original in the wider context of rap even as it repeats itself it captures the energy down there in new orleans the way nothing else does a joyful energetic living culture
4204243 weve been playing a lot of college campuses a lot more white events
4204244 just because a song dont have a triggerman beat or something doesnt make it not bounce
4204245 most people even those who knew exactly how many miles the arugula on their plate had traveled had no idea
4204246 desde que estoy aqui me han llamado hermafrodita ambigua y ahora gilipollas
4204247 x q ahora no hay viejas donde estan las chichis y
4204248 con la sangre se hacen morcillas de puta madre por qu no podemos hacer chistes
4204249 now the old king is dead long live the king

4204281 the political arm of the government was controlling much of the process through the legal adviser
4204282 the judicial system that bows to political pressures is not a system that an objective observer can have any confidence in
4204283 if we didnt get the military commission up and running and get the public behind it it would implode cases like khadrs were going to bring political support and make it harder for the next commander in chief to stop the process

4204321 i wrote first christmas so that the story of the birth of jesus christ could be shared in a special way among loved ones
4204322 it is my hope that my storybook will bring back balance to the celebration of christmas and in the process bring us all together to share in the wonder of this historic birth
4204323 there are a myriad of attractive books on santa claus christmas trees reindeer and other christmassey things
4204324 some stories out there are meant for very young children
4204325 others tell only a part of the tale some are illustrated with cartoon characters and others with characters who appear to be from des moines but whove suddenly grown a beard and put on middle eastern garb
4204326 as i wrote the poem i tried to place myself in marys and particularly josephs shoes
4204327 joseph is a bit of a forgotten figure but one who must have had a really good heart and extraordinary faith
4204328 i wrote a book that i hope will distract children from focusing on gifts toys and santa
4204329 when i embarked upon writing the story i really wondered about the whole immaculate conception premise of christs birth
4204330 yet as time went on so many things fell into place there are numerous examples of being blessed by moments of grace as i conceived and wrote first christmas as a result i simply had to face the realization that my doubts were quite groundless
4204331 i once told my wife that zeke is my alter ego to which she immediately replied well you know at times you can be a real ass
4204332 admittedly there is quite a bit of me in zeke
4204333 knowledge is just opinion that you trust enough to act upon

4204338 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
4204339 the issue is that in many ways mitt romney has had very definite swings of position not just on one or two things but on many of the issues
4204340 i think that there are better choices for sen mccain that will have the approval of values voters
4204341 there is absolutely no issue about mitt romneys religion i have never said that
4204342 yes rain cleans and has power to restore things that have been dried let rain speak for the nature
4204343 however the prevalence could be different even dramatically so in other populations such as africans or asians or in isolated populations such as amish finnish jewish and so on
4204344 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4204345 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4204346 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4204347 to my knowledge there are no known drugs that stimulate the production of this receptor however retinoic acid a drug used in several cancer prevention studies increases the production of tgf beta and could conceivably be tested in individuals who have tgfbr1
4204348 bill was a great mentor to all of us in many ways he was a great businessman he understood that he was more fortunate than many people he never lost touch with others and never lost his understanding that there were those less fortunate than him he knew his own faults and was not afraid to express them but he also had a deep understanding for those who struggled every day i think thats a fitting tribute to his career as a state senator
4204349 today people are still trying to process all the events of yesterday
4204350 then we obviously started talking about bill and our shared experiences over the years with him and some of us decided to go to the hospital to express our thoughts to the family
4204351 were all still trying to find out the whys related to the incident why did he shooter come there why bill gwatney why did he go to to the baptist convention headquarters two blocks away could he have thought he was entering the state republican headquarters
4204352 bryant resident dennis milligan chairman of the state republican party called to offer his condolences i have been really concerned about the governor and his chief of staff they all served with bill
4204353 charlie cole chaffin former state senator from benton was out of town and called she was one of those who served directly with him its like any group you belong to you become personal friends with them even if you disagree with them you know each others families their history little things funny things thats what i was thinking of last night about all of those who had been close to bill
4204354 what im hearing now is pretty much what were all hearing regarding the investigation by the arkansas state police
4204355 im thankful the shooter didnt injure any of those wonderful young people who work in democratic headquarters their lives will never be the same bill bragged on them all the time he said he couldnt do anything if it wasnt for them
4204356 this is a tragedy for the state for all americans for all people who serve he served in that position state chairman without pay and willingly did so he had just stopped by the office to sign letters and gets murdered its a really sad day for all of us
4204357 he asked me to chair the state party convention a few weeks ago
4204358 when he was state senator he got involved in the right things i know he was the governors dearest friend he was a friend to so many people in so many ways he meant a lot to me and were going to miss him i feel so sad for his family i pray the good lord will hold their hand through this
4204359 its just a tragic loss not only for the state of arkansas but for the democratic party how do you replace a man of that caliber of that integrity my heart goes out to his family his wife and children its a very sad time for us
4204360 he was not only chairman of our party but just a great man to go along with it he will be sorely missed he was a man that had the best interests of the state at heart hes a hard man to replace the state will miss his integrity and his business sense its a pretty sad time
4204361 at the time i heard about it i was on a trip in yellville and i just felt very sad i dont understand it it was senseless and beyond comprehension this is a great loss for the state my thoughts and prayers are with his family the citizens of arkansas and the democratic party i think this will heighten awareness in the state republican party i think we have to make sure we take care of our campaign workers and may change some of our security measures
4204362 it is a sad day anytime something like this happens just like everyone else in arkansas i was in shock when i found out if there was any political motivation behind it this is certainly not the way we handle things in america mr gwatney was such a fine man and we may have different political views but we was just a great person and a great leader my sympathy and prayers go out to the gwatney family
4204363 i served in the senate with him for nearly eight years from 1995 and i always found mr gwatney to be a person with great integrity love and great work ethic he was always a good person to get along with and he had great aspirations this is a great loss for his family and for the state of arkansas
4204364 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head back and saw big flames
4204365 we rushed to the site and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burnt prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4204366 one of the greatest challenges we face with multi platform games is how to deliver an equally fantastic experience across each platform
4204367 with x blades weve taken time to ensure the same intense hack and slash gameplay is delivered seamlessly on all platforms
4204368 tv and retractable doors go flush with the unit when opened measurements are 91
4204369 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4204370 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4204371 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4204372 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4204373 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4204374 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region
4204375 i think following the olympics there will be a crackdown in xinjiang like never before
4204376 we were excited about the progress we made last year
4204377 we put in a lot of hard work during the spring and with the new players we are bringing in it is our hope that we will be able to keep moving in the right direction
4204378 those are the things we need to work hard at every day because that is how we can be successful
4204379 we obviously want them to have great senior seasons special seasons
4204380 they will both play great roles on and off the field for us
4204381 we have a lot of people back that have played collegiate soccer
4204382 it will be essential for those returning players to help the freshmen get acclimated i am excited to see that leadership happen and we are going to try and make those newcomers comfortable in our system
4204383 those are the things we need to work hard at every day because that is how we can be successful
4204384 its exciting because we feel that we have a group of goalkeepers that understands it is going to be a competition
4204385 each and every one of them has to raise their level of play
4204386 it will be something we focus on in the first couple weeks of camp
4204387 once we get the right configuration of people back there we will train them up quite a bit
4204388 we need to keep working on our organization so we can enter the attacking third with numbers to create more scoring opportunities
4204389 we had more scoring chances last year than we did the year before and we have to keep that going in 2008
4204390 our forwards need to work together as a unit in order to break defenses down with numbers
4204391 the focus remains on creating as many scoring chances as we can
4204392 down to 10 men after three minutes valiant u s effort falls short as 2 1 loss to nigeria knocks them out of 2008 olympics
4204393 la modificaci n de la estructura de defensa venezolana que trae la nueva ley org nica aprobada por decreto el mes pasado es una copia exacta a lo que establecen las fuerzas armadas de cuba
4204394 el gobierno establece una fuerza armada regular que es la que tenemos pero muy desvencijada
4204395 crea la milicia y convierte en bolivariana a la tradicional fuerza armada venezolana
4204396 bajo esas dos estructuras el ejecutivo le asigna poderes iguales a tres ramas de la fuerza armada el ministerio de la defensa que pasa a ser un organismo netamente administrativo el comando estrat gico del ej rcito y las milicias revolucionarias
4204397 en el futuro inmediato no van a haber los componentes que hemos tendido hasta ahora fuerza armada nacional con su aspecto naval con su aspecto terrestre y su aspecto a reo
4204398 el nuevo instrumento legal establece la creaci n de zonas de defensa que son una copia del modelo cubano
4204399 lo que no pudo por la v a del referendo electoral que en diciembre del a o pasado rechaz su propuesta de reforma constitucional

4204404 we are deeply honored to partner with an organization as well known and respected as japan society
4204405 japan society is the first name in the world of japanese language instruction and cultural education and we couldnt image a better partner to bring the rich language and past of japan to the new york anime festival
4204406 to bring the people of the united states and japan closer together in appreciation and understanding of each other
4204407 to act is easy to think is hard to act according to our thought is troublesome

4204421 the employer might not explain the reason for the firing so its difficult to get accurate statistics on how often it happens
4204422 in the u s we have moved into a knowledge economy and the main tool is your brain the best possible aid to that tool is a vacation
4204423 the company doesnt have to give the employees any extra time off and it allows office workers much more flexibility
4204424 ok so its not ideal but if you want time off its the easiest way
4204425 if you can afford to do it id recommend it unfortunately many employees think its a bit strange if they dont have their nose to the grindstone all the time especially if they are funding the vacation themselves
4204426 working the brains neurons by taking up a challenging activity will leave you far more refreshed than sitting a resort doing nothing
4204427 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4204428 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4204429 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his lifestyle his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that
4204430 whether you are bob kearns or ghandi or martin luther king if you go up against the forces you will pay
4204431 hes an addict in some ways he wants to give it up but he cant
4204432 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4204433 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4204434 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4204435 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it

4204564 one thing kone is noticing is a rise in more expensive homes being lost to lenders
4204565 for example in arapahoe county 22 2 percent of the foreclosures were homes priced from 400 000 to 499 999 that doesnt surprise sarah hays of metro property brokers she is listing about 25 foreclosed homes priced from 500 000 to 575 000
4204566 the 575 000 home in castle rock sold for about 850 000 two years ago hays said
4204567 the trend is keeping people who dont have to sell their homes from putting them on the market

4204570 permits to build new houses in pueblo county have plummeted in 2008 due to the housing slowdown and the lack of additional soldiers that had been expected at fort carson in colorado springs
4204571 using 2002 as a more typical year for home sales ted jones chief economist for stewart title of colorado said pueblo actually has a normal home sales rate when compared to job and unemployment numbers
4204572 many real estate professionals dont realize that because theyre new and dont know how the market was before 2002

4204575 this house was a really good deal said jeremy willistein 26 who paid 165 000 for a 1 300 square foot entry model home last year
4204576 now after price decreases the starting price is 129 000 and pulte is working on a new floor plan that would be priced even lower said shawn chlarson division president for pulte
4204577 during the housing boom pinal county saw some of the states most rapid increases in development and now its suffering from some of the worst of the crash
4204578 bridwell said its only a matter of time until the slower market catches up to red rock and foreclosures show up there too their houses are worth less today than what they owe on them the same as everybody elses bridwell said
4204579 at the current sales pace it may take up to 10 years before red rock is built out chlarson said it will probably be at least two years until development can support a convenience store he said
4204580 i cant even get a coffee and a newspaper in the morning said michael tarr 40 who paid about 200 000 for an 1 800 square foot home last fall
4204581 for the second quarter the median resale home price in pinal county was 143 100 down from 156 160 in the first quarter and way down from 220 000 in the fourth quarter of 2005 according to the latest report from arizona state university

4204588 so many of those owners are just desperate to rent them for whatever rent they can get ingle said
4204589 compounding that rental situation is the influx of condominium conversions back into the rental market
4204590 the kingman secret as coined by mayor john salem is officially out kingman was the subject of a feature published in the new york times sunday which highlights the citys current and future potential as a destination for large las vegas based developers
4204591 both chris stevens of rhodes homes and leonard mardian of the mardian group were interviewed for the article
4204592 even as las vegas and phoenix suffer some of the nations highest foreclosure rates and steepest home value declines
4204593 in the article mardian predicts an additional million people will migrate to the region over the next decade then asks rhetorically where are they going to live
4204594 mayor salem elaborated on a few points he was quoted on in the article and sought to clarify friess characterization of him as a mayor who won election on a platform of being friendlier to developers thats not entirely true salem said
4204595 salem said while he believes growth is inevitable for kingman it is still important for that growth to be planned out accordingly people are going to come no matter what he said
4204596 buddy yates sits at a dining room table awash in paperwork within one block of his home more than a half dozen residences are bank owned or in some stage of the foreclosure process according to realty trac a web site that maintains a nationwide database of foreclosed homes
4204597 like his neighbors yates was hit by a slumping economy and falling real estate values
4204598 last year his income started to shrink as it was getting harder for yates to pay his 300 000 mortgage the value of his home was dropping and as a result he couldnt refinance his loan three weeks ago yates met his new neighbors who had just purchased the house next door out of foreclosure for 167 000
4204599 his texas based lender emc said that yates was offered a fair deal that would allow him to keep his home but yates who has missed more than one payment said the repayment plan would put him only further behind
4204600 yates has asked a nonprofit housing counseling group for assistance if he doesnt get a reprieve he said hes expecting a letter this month saying the company will foreclose on his home
4204601 when they sold you the home they knew with the adjustable interest rate you werent going to be able to make the payment yates said

4204604 it is evident that the las vegas economy is slowly contracting says josh seime manager of metrostudys las vegas division
4204605 the increase in sales of existing homes since january is because of sales of bank owned properties seime says as for the condo market closings have dropped below new starts in the past two quarters
4204606 vacant lots have remained stable since the beginning of 2007 seime says in the 12 months ending in june they have declined 1 4 percent for a total of 31 193 lots at the end of june a 48 3 month supply he says
4204607 while the first homeowners have yet to move in 40 percent of the 370 units in the montage condominiums have been sold proof that theres a niche for luxury housing in downtown reno says developer fernando leal
4204608 at the montage housing will range from penthouses priced at up to 2 6 million to one and two bedroom units and lofts ranging from 320 000 to 975 000 and studios starting at 245 000
4204609 in all he said no more than 500 units are for sale at the montage as well as other downtown condominiums an economic consultant hired by the reno redevelopment agency has projected sales of about 200 condos a year in downtown reno to buyers who are primarily young professionals or empty nesters seeking an escape from suburbia
4204610 if thats so that means a standing inventory of no more than two years for downtown condos which leal said is hardly an overbuilt market
4204611 i believe in this town how often do you get to be a daniel burnham leal said of burnham a renowned city planner of chicago where leal built his first projects
4204612 we built too fast too long then all of a sudden the bottom fell out said tom gallagher of summit engineers said of developments in the reno sparks area
4204613 looking at all construction in reno over the past 10 years the slide is even worse vern kloos a reno senior planner said the steep downturn was bound to happen after four years of 1 billion in permits

4204615 sunset bluffs is just one of several residential developments that have defaulted in an area hit especially hard by the housing downturn
4204616 with property values plummeting and demand for houses cooling after reaching a peak in 2005 sunset bluffs like many developments in the truckee meadows is in financial trouble
4204617 at least five businesses that did contracting and subcontracting work for the development have filed more than 1 2 million in liens for unpaid services the largest was a lien for more than 952 000 filed last year by jess arndell construction the developers failure to honor financial commitments ruined the local construction company said mark simons attorney for jess arndell construction
4204618 jess arndell essentially trusted and believed the developers were going to pay him and he ended up carrying way too much debt simons said
4204619 our sales are off and weve been making adjustments for two years in anticipation of the downturn said jim dickey credit manager of western nevada supply
4204620 even putting a lien on a developers land or property to attempt to collect money owed doesnt guarantee that a subcontractor will get that money given the steep declines seen in property values the developments are no longer worth enough to cover all their associated expenses
4204621 i believe in this town how often do you get to be a daniel burnham leal said of burnham a renowned city planner of chicago where leal built his first projects

4204631 the results of the attack were respectable if not spectacular seven iraqi air defense guns destroyed along with three artillery systems five radars and 25 vehicles or other weapons systems not one apache was shot down shortly afterward the 3rd infantry division slashed through the medina on its way toward baghdad

4204695 more than one reasonable inference could be drawn in regard to the reasonableness of the hospitals safety precautions
4204696 that the hospital failed to keep its premises reasonably safe
4204697 specifically advised to remove the trees because they produced debris which created a nuisance and maintenance problem
4204698 the hospital was negligent in failing to provide reasonably safe conditions for its visitors and patients by not removing the trees or employing an adequate maintenance program when it had actual and constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition created by the sweet gum trees
4204699 had notice that the floor mats were wrinkled or bunched immediately prior to cooks fall
4204700 the testimony of the tendency of the floor mats to wrinkle was directly relevant to the issue of whether a dangerous condition existed in the store

4204791 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy

4204860 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
4204861 the russians will know where they are and what they are doing
4204862 putin is interested in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4204863 there needs to be some consequences for russias actions against a sovereign state

4204901 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4204902 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4204903 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4204904 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders

4204915 really affects some of the high profile cases that gen hartmann has had his hands in
4204916 we are going to have to address those in court
4204917 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head back and saw big flames
4204918 we rushed to the site and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burnt prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4204919 before we never had problems like this just a few bad people causing trouble
4204920 im feeling really frightened now its not safe at all
4204921 after the incident relevant authorities handled it according to law preserved social stability and the normal order of work and life
4204922 people who directly and indirectly supported the coup were appointed as members of organizations responsible for taking action against me
4204923 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4204924 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4204925 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4204926 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4204927 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4204928 they remain subject of both domestic or local and internal sanctions and investigations
4204929 because they are active members and contributing to the support network for karadzic
4204930 they are part of a network that has been the subject of ongoing criminal investigations for many years
4204931 with their bank accounts ordered frozen five years ago how is it that theyve come to live with no visible means of support all this time
4204932 they have multiple properties they take vacations in montenegro they travel to belgrade how no money no jobs they dont pay income tax they have cash in their house they cant explain how it gets there
4204933 karadzic as has been proven to be the case and mladic remain within the reach of serbian authorities and always have been
4204934 mladic is probably the hardest target there is and i think bringing him to justice will be very difficult it could take a week it could take a month it could take a year
4204935 my conscience told me that i shouldnt continue to cheat myself and others
4204936 only earlier this year did my wife admit that she had transferred some campaign money abroad

4204940 where are you going to work what do you want to do now and do you have health insurance

4204943 i received a call monday saying i could qualify for the tickets if i do 12 hours of volunteer work for the obama campaign between now and friday the 15th
4204944 to work 40 hours at my job get to and from work get to and from the campaign office and complete the 12 hours in three days would be next to impossible
4204945 even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us
4204946 it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users
4204947 our goal is to provide full two way service with twitter via sms to every nation in a way that is sustainable from a cost perspective talks with mobile companies around the world continue
4204948 while noaa works to end overfishing and rebuild wild fish stocks the u s also needs more sustainable domestic aquaculture to help meet consumer demand for healthy seafood and narrow the foreign trade gap

4204961 we consider dip pen nanolithography which is nanotechnologys version of the quill pen and now polymer pen lithography to be two of northwesterns most important inventions
4204962 we can go in a sense from an ultra fine point sharpie to one with a fat tip
4204963 the tip of each polymer pen starts with nanometer scale sharpness but if we press down harder the tip flattens out this gives us great flexibility in the structures we can produce

4204975 at a time when americans are paying 4 a gallon gas and areas like central and upstate new york are hemorrhaging jobs this news is particularly galling the bush administration told us at the beginning of this war that reconstruction would be paid for by iraq through oil revenue we need to help the iraqi people get back on their feet but we also have pressing needs here at home
4204976 perhaps no better example is representative james t walsh a 10 term republican from new york who announced in january that he would retire when his term expired mr walsh has a key role over appropriations and is a fixture in his syracuse area district making him a formidable candidate to challenge but with mr walsh out of the way democrats appear to be in a strong position to pick up his seat in part because of the fund raising advantage held by dan maffei the democratic candidate mr maffei who lost to mr walsh by about 3 400 votes in 2006 has nearly 1 million in his campaign account compared with nearly 110 000 raised by his republican opponent dale sweetland a former county legislator
4204977 energy independence is not realistic im not sure its even desirable
4204978 i refuse to believe every option for speeding up progress on the new centro hub has been exhausted instead of exclusively focusing all our energies on arguing about drilling for more oil we need to discuss alternative energy and alternative transportation options that will decrease our dependence on oil
4204979 the issue set and the audience were decidedly different a couple of hours later when maffei went to the mostly black southside neighborhood for a roundtable with local residents and business owners at a community resource center
4204980 the southside of syracuse is a place of endless potential that has so far at least in the last several decades been unrealized
4204981 maffei told the group of about 20 at the southside community resource center that if elected he will push for changes in the federal empowerment zone tax credit to make it more beneficial for syracuse businesses
4204982 a democrat hoping to replace republican congressman james walsh after this novembers elections says he wants input on how to turn the local economy around dan maffei is launching a series of meetings to discuss economic development maffei met with community members on tuesday on syracuses southside an area ravaged by high unemployment and business closings he says there is a chance to turn things around
4204983 hes our player and he wanted to play in the game and we think hes mentally tuned into it so thats all that matters
4204984 i wouldnt be particularly sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4204985 increasing big oils already record setting profits wont help consumers at the pump and drilling in anwr wont produce a single barrel of oil for a decade we have to do more now to diversify where we get our energy like investing in natural gas solar and wind and finally break our addiction to oil
4204986 unfortunately congress is gridlocked and will now recess for five weeks without passing anything to help real people deal with the suffocating gas prices when i get to congress i will move beyond partisanship and produce some real results for americans

4204992 i think the most challenging part has been learning the harmonies theres a lot of hard harmonies
4204993 i wouldnt say i have a lot of lines but i do have a couple of solos
4204994 we learn from watching each other and share ideas on how to build from each other
4204995 its really enjoyable because we see how good they are and how they approach things and stuff its a lot of fun

4205005 its certainly a possibility but not something that were actively looking at right now
4205006 plug ins are going to be the wave of the future but it isnt really there yet
4205007 i honestly thought id have success when i got up here
4205008 i understand that most baseball statistics even out over time
4205009 i know its not going to last but after i do give up a run im hoping to bounce back and reel off another 20 or 30 scoreless innings just because i think thats my job as a reliever to me that seems very possible if i just go and execute pitches
4205010 theres a lot of red white and blue countrywide spirit going around and its important we salute it
4205011 its just a good day to get out of the office have a good time and enjoy some golf
4205012 i had a great time but i dont play as often as i should the knees went bad
4205013 so the state understands that we local governments are tired of picking up their load and they should be carrying their own load up there weve done it long enough
4205014 its no solution whatsoever its just a continuation of postponing inevitable decisions that the state should make

4205080 what is truly disturbing about the image of beyonce is that loreal has taken one of the most talented and beautiful black women in the world and in my view has deliberately lightened her colour and hair in order to sell a beauty product
4205081 this has to be the ultimate insult to every black woman out there beyonce included it is suggesting that in order to be beautiful and appealing she needs to be white

4205155 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november
4205156 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4205157 to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4205158 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4205159 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4205174 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4205175 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4205176 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4205177 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it

4205179 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4205180 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4205181 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4205182 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4205183 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4205184 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4205185 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4205186 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4205187 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4205188 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
4205189 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran

4205225 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church
4205226 on feb 2 1961 several months after they met obamas parents got married in maui according to divorce records
4205227 other sources say divorce papers confirm that a civil ceremony was held on maui on february 2 1961 when ann was three months pregnant with obama
4205228 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born

4205232 in 1932 johns hopkins university played a team from canada in front of 80 000 spectators which appears to still be a lacrosse record
4205233 there were 80 000 people in the stands all right but they were there for the marathon the marathon was about to finish the same afternoon in the same stadium and the crowd was there to see that and there we were out on the field playing lacrosse against canada
4205234 canada was the only other team there we played three games with them we won the first and third lost the second
4205235 he was our captain and leader and he was the one we turned to when we needed it
4205236 we went to california by train it took three days but we had a good time in the club car our coach ray van orman was a great conditioner so none of us drank we went to a party at the home of a hollywood director who was married to francis x bushmans daughter we visited the mgm lot and watched them shoot a scene with jean harlow
4205237 the crowds we played before in the olympics are my greatest memory
4205238 its true that when we had 105 000 in the stands the people were there for the marathon but for the other two games we played i believe there were 50 000 people there that was impressive
4205239 we went out on the train i had an upper berth it was a lot of fun jack turnbull was the backbone of our team he was a no 1 as good as anybody who ever played
4205240 is that for men it must be played in 75 countries on four continents slightly less for women with an aggressive approach id say itll take 15 20 years for us to get there once we get to scale then well have to deal with ioc politics
4205241 ten years ago we only had 12 so weve doubled that if we can double what we have now well be close
4205242 the descriptions we have are so vague as to be useless
4205243 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4205244 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life

4205251 i think retail will be a bit softer over the next 12 months or so but queensland i expect will trade a little better than some other parts of australia
4205252 you certainly have higher population growth here than is occurring elsewhere and i think that along with strong employment will underpin a better retail environment here
4205253 the ministerial meeting will also focus on further strengthening to the trans tasman trade and economic relationship including the single economic market agenda
4205254 the industry wants to be treated on the basis of a level playing field with other countries around the world
4205255 now every other country of the 12 or so nations that i mentioned spends considerable sums of money working with their industry because those countries understand the importance of the car industry to their particular economies the australian industry is no different

4205264 the areas of the country that saw prices go through the roof and then fall into the basement wont be the first ones to see an upturn
4205265 its more likely to come in a place like cleveland or other midwestern cities that largely missed the boom
4205266 other communities are just behind cleveland and they will start to come out of it pretty soon
4205267 if you look at cleveland or minneapolis theyre almost back to where they started
4205268 most other parts of the country have a ways to go before they can say that
4205269 its going to be like a long slow car crash to work through the housing situation and were still in the middle of it
4205270 ultimately what has to happen is you have to have prices reach a level that will pull buyers in
4205271 the report states that queensland has more level crossings than victoria yet queensland only had 50 people hospitalised from level crossing collisions in this five year period less than half the number in victoria
4205272 it must be noted too that investigations by the australian transport safety bureau found that in almost every level crossing collision driver error was the cause with the motorist failing to stop or give way
4205273 the government is taking action to improve safety at level crossings but all motorists need to do their bit
4205274 we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield
4205275 i bet she was a spy in world war ii
4205276 we have defined a niche market along the lakeshore region of west michigan for green luxury products in this area the population is on the rise the influx of affluent people acquiring primary and secondary residences has increased the demand for luxury items of the highest caliber
4205277 as an import myself to michigan i realized that many of the green products i took for granted were simply not available here and that fact makes this area ripe for our service
4205278 people constantly ask me what made me start this type of business at such a young age
4205279 as far as my age is concerned i love being an entrepreneur it is a joy to help customers rediscover the art of relaxation and help them learn about skincare consequently i wont be one of those twenty somethings searching for a calling
4205280 warmly welcomed and strongly supports the application for anti trust immunity
4205281 anti trust immunity between oneworlds transatlantic partners would enable them to unlock even more of oneworlds potential enabling us to operate under the same rules as our alliance competitors
4205282 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4205283 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4205284 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4205285 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4205286 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4205287 cooperate commercially on flights between the united states mexico and canada and the european union switzerland and norway while continuing to operate as separate legal entities
4205288 nobody but your own mother and the members of assorted biker gangs are going to read this and the biker gangs are going to be deeply offended
4205289 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4205290 i think that presidents deserve to be questioned maybe irreverently most of the time to bring em down a size
4205291 access to a president doesnt mean youre gonna get the truth
4205292 this work changes the textbook picture of the lifecycle of the leishmaniasis parasite identifying the inflammatory cell known as the neutrophil as the predominant cell involved during the initiation of infection
4205293 parasites transmitted by sand flies to mice lacking neutrophils have more difficulty establishing an infection and surviving this demonstrates the importance of neutrophils at the site of an infected sand fly bite and suggests the unexpected path taken by the parasite from sand fly to neutrophil to macrophage is a critical component of this disease
4205294 marc un significativo hito en cuanto a la relaci n del parlamento con la gente
4205295 estaremos siempre atentos para acudir al llamado de la instituci n legislativa
4205296 en esta oportunidad el pueblo no solamente ofreci sus observaciones sus proposiciones sino que por primera vez gente que no tiene nada que ver con la instituci n desde el punto de vista burocr tico pudo intervenir entre ellos trabajadores amas de casa e incluso estudiantes de la oposici n para argumentar sus posiciones abriendo un espacio para la opini n del ciudadano

4205299 i like reading and organizing things and thinking about a problem and analyzing solutions
4205300 i enjoy my neighbors im a community volunteer and at the end of the day its a very beautiful place to live
4205301 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
4205302 so the state understands that we local governments are tired of picking up their load and they should be carrying their own load up there weve done it long enough
4205303 its no solution whatsoever its just a continuation of postponing inevitable decisions that the state should make
4205304 major automakers have announced delivery of plug in vehicles to the u s marketplace by 2010 but with 54 million garages for the 247 million registered passenger vehicles in the u s today most consumers do not have a way to charge a plug in vehicle
4205305 its certainly a possibility but not something that were actively looking at right now
4205306 plug ins are going to be the wave of the future but it isnt really there yet
4205307 one of my unattained career goals was to do a childrens book and when kris brought bruce the little blue spruce to me i instantly knew this would be it
4205308 not only did i love the gentle message of accepting the differences in ourselves and others but the challenge of drawing a story where the principal character was a tree was too much to pass up
4205309 it is a red light telling us that something is beginning to go wrong with the quality of water
4205310 algae is the first thing to be affected by a change in water quality
4205311 algae suffering from lead poisoning like waste discharged from battery and paint manufacturing plants will produce a different sound than those suffering from lack of iron or exposure to other toxins
4205312 theres a lot of red white and blue countrywide spirit going around and its important we salute it
4205313 its just a good day to get out of the office have a good time and enjoy some golf
4205314 i had a great time but i dont play as often as i should the knees went bad
4205315 its hit and miss some weeks we have a lot of property crimes others we dont
4205316 typically when the economy starts to go bad we do tend to see property crimes increase
4205317 a lot of guys go out randomly hitting areas looking for targets and signs that there will be something
4205318 i havent heard anything on the street but i know that property crimes are up we certainly beefed up security since
4205319 the percentage of solvability is not really high it depends on people in the neighborhood we have to use their eyes to see whats going on
4205320 thats what it all comes down to theres nothing miraculous about solving a crime its just evidence

4205349 more candidates are doing maths than at any other time in the past the country needs that
4205350 todays results for science and maths a levels give us reason to be encouraged
4205351 maths and further maths have continued their robust recovery with the numbers of students taking these a levels increasing for the fifth year in a row
4205352 this is a welcome pay off for the serious efforts made in recent years to boost this subject
4205353 the embryonic turn around we saw in physics last year has been consolidated we hope this will signal a longer term turn around for the subject
4205354 it is another good year for chemistry and biology which both continue the steady increases theyve seen in recent years
4205355 at a time when all too frequently we hear doom and gloom predictions of a decline in stem subjects what a change from the usual hand wringing the reporting of todays a level results makes for reading
4205356 for once we are seeing widespread positive coverage of the uptake in entries for all stem subjects with increases ranging from 2 3 up to 15 5
4205357 that was informative and a great summary but what is the solution what do you propose is the next step in making or creating change

4205379 i am a lot more comfortable with the momentum we have going right now
4205380 i think the last two weeks has shown how focused our team is at the job at hand it makes me proud of our guys and proud of our whole organization
4205381 you still have to keep in mind that if you take a chance and dont finish a race that youll lose a lot of points and the 10 bonus points you thought you might gain for the chase wont happen either you have to do the same things that have gotten you to victory lane in the past
4205382 you cant afford to take too many unnecessary chances the main thing for us is to do the things weve been doing to keep us in position where we can win races each week and get those bonus points for the chase
4205383 weve got a couple of weeks here where we can try things and have that flexibility
4205384 but the good thing is that were not struggling and having to try new things we have the ability to do that if we want to because of where we are in the points but regardless were in a good spot

4205403 she appeared before the court yesterday and was again remanded only the lawyers were allowed to enter the courtroom weve not met with her for two weeks why didnt the authorities allow us to meet with her there was no official announcement of such a ban however she is reportedly no longer being held in solitary confinement
4205404 we are worried about her health as she is suffering from a heart ailment she will have anxiety when she is not allowed to meet with us the authorities are giving trouble not only to prisoners but also to their family members

4205406 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
4205407 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
4205408 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4205409 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better

4205416 i would like to share with you all my unpleasant encounter while catching a movie last friday at golden village cinemas in vivocity
4205417 i was unlucky to have worn a skirt as this resulted in me being viciously attacked by starving bugs hidden in the seat during the 1hour 30 minute screening session
4205418 in response to the incident reported in stomp by silvia golden village sincerely apologises to silvia for the unpleasant movie experience
4205419 golden village has engaged the services of a pest control company who conducted a thorough pest check and inspection on the specific seat and the surrounding seats as well
4205420 the pest control company has confirmed with a certified report that no bugs could be found her condition might have been due to an allergy reaction or an insect that flew into the cinema
4205421 as a precautionary and preventative measure the pest control company has fumigated the cinema hall and will closely monitor the situation over the next few weeks
4205422 as per our regular maintenance and detailed cleaning procedures golden village will continue to conduct monthly pest control inspections to ensure the safety and comfort in our cinema halls for all our patrons
4205423 to make up for silvias unpleasant movie experience we would like to offer her two pairs of complimentary movie passes as a gesture of apology and goodwill

4205428 yesterdays newsday column was absolutely despicable and they should be ashamed and embarrassed for having printed it

4205430 this is not a freedom of speech issue this is newsday giving this woman a license to assault these fine men in print accusing them of complicity in murder
4205431 newsday should immediately publish a full retraction and an abject and absolute apology to those defamed by this womans wretched words and ms rugile should never again appear in their pages

4205694 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4205695 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4205696 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4205706 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4205707 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4205708 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4205711 the question is how do insurers draw the line when the driver switches off the system do they switch it off legitimately because they are on their lunch hour or do they do it deliberately because they are about to commit a crime
4205712 other points of debate include the right for police or government agencies to ask for such data and how long the data should be kept if they ask for gps records from insurer because there is reason to believe a vehicle has been used for a crime

4205776 i can sense things but i cant read signs i sense
4205777 either way there is a chance that the two living weapons we need to open that door are down there lets go
4205778 i dont know but at least shes doing something instead of being stubborn
4205779 a strong looking man like you must beat women away with a stick
4205780 she smells like the pub i could never stand that smell
4205781 you can stand the smell of a blacksmith shop but not the pub what kind of person are you
4205782 which one of you was a meanie to my baby sister
4205783 i wasnt a meanie i merely moved her away from me with my ki eyes glow green like this
4205784 your sister smells like a pub i dont like that smell so i moved her away from me thats all i did
4205785 bear blade techinique ki bear now i only made this into a statue like manifestation of my ki but if you piss me off i will animate it and it will attack you
4205786 dont do something like that this is a party scene we are celebrating the raise of new fighters that are giving those magos bastards a run for their money in fact they are in the middle of the crowd celebrating there are four of them each with a weird weapon an axe a sword a messed up sword and a sheild with spikes
4205787 are these people by chance fighters who took down 9 airships in a single battle while fighting a horde of magos on the ground
4205788 you heard of them then they call themselves the magos destroyers
4205789 let them have the glory besides we can use this to our advantage
4205790 you are going to have the magos follow them instead of us arent you
4205791 if they want the glory they need to be ready for the fights that go along with it
4205792 what is this group doing they should be drinking like the rest of us but those two little boys look too young to drink though
4205793 theres only one young person here and thats my little brother here
4205794 thats one of the boys but i meant that boy back behind you with the large axe on his back
4205795 why are all the people in this town stupid im a woman damn it
4205796 you dont look like one carrying that axe women who fight use smaller weapons to take advantage of our quick bodies that huge thing is too big to be a womans weapon
4205797 shouldnt we stop her there could be trouble if we let her keep going
4205798 be my guest and try and stop her as angry as she is now i dont want to get near her to stop her eyes widen now i dont mind
4205799 its not nice to interrupt a fight especially one that the other person started bear techinique bear hug
4205800 i didnt say i wouldnt help her i just said i wouldnt stop her

4205808 i have respect for you as a swordsman thats why i didnt slice your back up instead i saw an opening and blocked your ki in your body and without ki you cant use magic
4205809 shut the hell up this man is a fraud damn it if you want something done do it yourself start a coup and overthrow the magos in this town there are so many of you and you all seem to have living weapons use your magic against them

4205823 the talks in geneva were positive and we believe that a positive direction was found
4205824 we believe it will be reasonable to discuss the common issues in those packages and reach a compromise this could pave the way for resolving the disputed issues
4205825 we expect the negotiation process to continue with the good will of all parties and reach a positive outcome in a short time

4205847 the first system we had was pretty small and not scalable beyond a few stores so once spyder started looking at more serious growth plans we started looking at bigger systems
4205848 the problem was that spyder was kind of in the middle ground the small system wasnt going to do it but we couldnt spend 1 million to buy a large system ultimately epicors saas model was a good choice because we didnt have to take on all the infrastructure and support we just get to run our business
4205849 weve only been doing this for a year and a half so were still learning who our outlet customers are
4205850 short of capturing rudimentary customer data we couldnt do anything with the old system with this new system we are collecting more quality data than we were before but as far as direct retail were still learning ourselves the entire appeal of the crm is that it will allow us to determine who is shopping and where
4205851 those are three universities that have very solid football programs and in time i really believe theyll be a part of the western athletic conference
4205852 that would be great because it will give us a chance from a budgetary standpoint to get more out of our revenue sources
4205853 we have no immediate plans other than to continue to upgrade our football situation
4205854 the cost to go through college and university is high so it is a great time for hsbc to start the relationship with young people through bank accounts student loans and credit cards and music is a great way to get in touch with students
4205855 sepatutnya dalam soal ini yang dipertua mpp uitm bertemu dengan tan sri khalid dan berbincang dengan baik tentang isu ini sampaikan bantahan beliau sebagai mewakili suara teman teman mahasiswa yang lain sepatutnya demonstrasi dijadikan langkah terakhir setelah semua usaha yang dilakukan gagal bukankah selama ini mereka anti demonstrasi
4205856 jika cadangan itu dikeluarkan oleh menteri kpt atau perdana menteri memang wajar demonstrasi dilakukan ini sekadar seorang ketua kerajaan negeri yang bercakap saya fikir mahasiswa ydp mpp uitm kena semak semula senarai negeri dan senarai persekutuan yang tercatat di dalam perlembagaan

4205865 new 16 year cycle of innovation and growth that follows the previous cycle of networked computing for enterprise applications and the internet
4205866 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4205867 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4205868 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4205869 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4205870 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4205871 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4205872 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits
4205873 good good and anxious i always get anxious before a show
4205874 hmm i cant say that i do ive been around the area though
4205875 see i play at this casino where they bus in a lot of chinese people from san francisco
4205876 pardon me excuse me i need to get through here
4205877 if i find myself being stared at i say what are you looking at in a harsh tone in chinese that one really startles them
4205878 i can also say bah koodzah twoe sha lie please pardon my phonetic spelling which is just a lot of fun to say
4205879 oh thats a great one youve got to email that to me ive got a certain lady id like to say that one to heh heh how do they react to that one
4205880 well it gets them moving away from me pretty quick
4205881 i walked over to him and said thats a lot of drinks youve got there dont you worry boy he said to me ill get to em then he motioned to a bottle of liquor hed brought in that was sitting on the floor next to his chair and then some he said boy he was a mean mother but he sure could play
4205882 it was a pleasure im sure well play together again someday soon thank you name redacted
4205883 i would rather be a man toiling suffering nay failing and successless here than lead a dull prosperous life in the old worn grooves of what you call more aristocratic society down in the south
4205884 i thought we got a lot accomplished i complimented the players and the coaches especially the coaching staff i thought they did a great job on offense defense and special teams and really feeling a little bit of toughness thats what you want to find out at training camp with pads on thats the missing element when youre in the spring when you come here you find out who the physical players are going to be
4205885 well thats whats good about it with young guys they never get tired of talking that generally stirs the competition you know that in football it was all good chatter never anything negative just having fun when you work hard and have fun you get a lot of things accomplished the attitude here was very good and now we have to continue to improve
4205886 turk will be okay glenn will be okay well figure out in warm ups if dorsey can go and he probably can go but well be selective with him rb jamaal charles shoulder is hurt and he probably wont go s jon mcgraw probably will not go mcintosh should be fine
4205887 hell be limited we want to get him in hes got two weeks left
4205888 he hurt his shoulder hes going to be fine but were going to be very careful with him he kind of fell on it hell be okay well keep him out hes sore
4205889 probably like we did last week to be quite honest with you probably do the same thing again probably qb brodie croyle will stay in a little later get him to the second quarter he just needs to play if we have a couple drives again thats good wed like to get him in during two minute both the other quarterbacks have been in for two minute im hoping we can move the ball again and score some points
4205890 yeah but depending on how this thing goes you never know but yeah third game for sure youd like to get him in there for that you can play offense for two minutes but you cant script it

4205907 probably not significantly more a little more and a lot of it will of course depend on the health of people
4205908 its been a quick turnaround and we had a couple of practices and it seemed like we just played a couple of days ago
4205909 i feel like a lot of the guys in the first group are anxious to get back out there i know we had only two series last week
4205910 were going to have to make some adjustments from last weeks game
4205911 we want to eliminate certain mental errors and not turn the ball over or force it into coverage we want to get in the flow of our offense a little bit more and get in and out of the huddle i just felt like those things werent where they needed to be last week
4205912 we have a lot of fans above the border and its good to bring them this game and its exciting for us because it is in canada and you dont see that happen
4205913 its a preseason game and were getting ready for a regular season up here too

4205923 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4205924 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4205925 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4205926 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4205927 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4205928 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4205929 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits

4205948 lynne demanded that jamie lynn not keep the baby at first jamie lynn agreed but then casey talked her into keeping the baby
4205949 lynne doesnt believe casey loves jamie lynn even though he wants to marry her she thinks he got jamie lynn pregnant on purpose for money and the fame of being the father of her baby
4205950 i think casey is a serial cheater who lied to jamie lynn and betrayed her time and time again
4205951 even though in her heart she knows that caseys a lying cheating dog jamie lynn is head over heels in love with him she continues to take him back regardless of how awful he treats her
4205952 the past spring casey was forced to tell jamie lynn that hed cheated and gotten the girl pregnant the girl miscarried several months later but jamie lynn had already taken casey back two weeks earlier
4205953 in fact only a few months before getting that girl pregnant casey had cheated on jamie lynn by dating another girl whitney seals of magnolia mississippi
4205954 casey managed to keep his dates with whitney quiet for about a month but rumors started getting back to jamie lynn after he took whitney to an lsu football game and they partied with some of his and jamie lynns best friends
4205955 jamie lynn wants to believe that casey is going to start acting responsibly but judging by his history of cheating that just isnt going to happen

4205967 we know we have a target on our back from last year
4205968 they want to get us back but we know exactly what to expect from them weve been watching last years film and were getting pretty jacked
4205969 this is a step toward real security for poland in the future
4205970 it looks as if were near agreement and we hope to make a joint announcement today
4205971 concerning the permanent presence of patriots missiles that will be able to effectively protect our territory
4205972 russians should see that this is not a demoralized you know nervous panicking capital that is just scared
4205973 shops are open there are no lines for gas stations prices are not up
4205974 we will fight to the end until the last russian soldier leaves georgian soil and this country is not going to be brought to the knees anymore we are not surrendering no matter what
4205975 we already saw the u s air force landing in georgia despite russians controlling the airspace
4205976 and we will see u s military ships entering georgian ports despite russians blocking it that we will see
4205977 what do i need a country that kills its citizens for
4205978 now the situation is that the people are strongly supporting the government the solidarity in georgian society is quite high
4205979 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4205980 they smile at you while they dig a grave for you behind your back
4205981 we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield
4205982 our key demand the presence of patriots has been accepted by the americans
4205983 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles

4205986 the report states that queensland has more level crossings than victoria yet queensland only had 50 people hospitalised from level crossing collisions in this five year period less than half the number in victoria
4205987 it must be noted too that investigations by the australian transport safety bureau found that in almost every level crossing collision driver error was the cause with the motorist failing to stop or give way
4205988 the government is taking action to improve safety at level crossings but all motorists need to do their bit
4205989 the polarisation of wealth across the age groups and the significant increase in consumer debt levels spurred by a growing divide between house prices and household income levels has resulted in an increase in the number of australian households at risk of mortgage default
4205990 surprisingly despite the marked distribution in wealth to the baby boomers their collective appetite for leveraged finance remains undiminished with those in the 45 59 age group holding over a third of the nations debt
4205991 consequently many younger australians have been crowded out of the property market altogether and many more are now dependent on credit providers

4206025 first thing utilities in the region and individual consumers can do is look at how well they are using energy and what they are paying 50 cents or more kilowatt hour for how can we get them to have energy efficient lights which are much too expensive in this region at the moment but will make a big difference
4206026 we should also look at how the pacific consumers can get efficient appliances that do not use much power or do not use much petrol unfortunately we do not have that in the pacific even though the price for power is much higher than anywhere else
4206027 now it is the price of diesel and this is going to push us faster towards looking at alternative energy has just put in a wave turbine now that is a bit way off for the pacific but it is one of the ways we can go
4206028 we should look at all opportunities for renewable resources wind waves and the sun rather than bringing a tanker in and paying 4 to 5 a gallon for fuel
4206029 government also has a crucial role to make sure that energy is a key item in the national plan and let the utilities manage properly and not interfere pacific utilities though small are very highly regarded

4206048 similar assessments are also currently underway in bay benadir middle shabelle galgaduud and lower shabelle
4206049 the increase in children living or working on the street has also been reported by the benadir child protection network no figures are stated
4206050 among other essential protection issues for children the assessments will provide insight into the scale of the problem as such unicef is not in a position to comment on figures at this stage the assessments will be completed by this coming sunday in the field and will then be analysed
4206051 but we do support programmes that monitor the violations against children that provide psycho social care and support to children for example in afgoye through schools as well as community mobilisation programmes to highlight child protection issues at community level

4206063 becky wrote the lyrics to this one but i think its about moving from place to place and trying to remember the constants which make you happy when theres a lot of change and disruption over a period of time
4206064 i know they were a full band and maybe didnt harmonise together that much but my favorite use of male female vocals over a whole album would have to be rumours era fleetwood mac without a doubt local london band the xx have a really nice boy girl thing going on too of course wham were pretty damn special oh and jonathan wolf of why and andrew broder fog made one of my favourite tracks ever hymies basement on lex

4206117 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4206118 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4206119 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4206120 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4206121 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4206122 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4206123 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4206124 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4206125 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

4206223 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
4206224 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
4206225 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
4206226 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
4206227 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
4206228 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market

4206231 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats

4206246 you and i both know your little symphony is all washed up who needs it i cant stand the music you play no offense since i hate any kind of music pretty much i was only donating because it made me look good to be a patron of the arts but who cares about the arts now especially those german pieces you keep playing we just kicked the butts of those krauts but no you want to play the same kind of music hitler liked beethoven wagner mozart
4206247 could have been bailstein originally but thats not the only reason im pulling out of your little tea party i know you cant see the writing on the wall but i can last night i had a christmas vision and it shook me gentlemen it shook me so that i cant forget it and must act on it
4206248 i am doomed to walk the earth in these terrible chains for my sins
4206249 you were always a fine banker and decent enough chum
4206250 you donated to charities you were on the board of the bradford falls philharmonic
4206251 yes i was on that board and supported that orchestra not because i liked that kind of music i have a tin ear and much prefer dirty limericks to concert music but because it was the thing for wealthy men like me and you to do but in the end it meant nothing i died and was still damned as a greedy exploiter of mankind and now i have to wear these chains and wander about moaning like a b movie character

4206264 i view it as another manifestation of the u s stock market slump
4206265 the underperformance of stocks and the drive for outsized return on equity is leading to investment distortions of the very worst sort we saw this in the mortgage market with their securities it got to a point that if the interest rate was high enough banks made the loan weve seen it in oil where the unattractiveness of stocks led institutions to dive into oil futures driving up prices well above historic gains and now it looks like public pension funds are catching the bug or flu
4206266 some of these high risk investment tactics will work but many wont but the bottom line is i dont think its an acceptable risk for a public pension fund its too much risk for their mission
4206267 these are public pension funds for civil servants teachers firemen police not supplemental investments for 20 million level accredited investors with a spare million or two to park

4206270 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4206271 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4206272 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4206277 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale

4206295 we wanted to really keep the pressure on them we wanted to kind of redeem ourselves
4206296 this was kind of like a payback game for us and we knew that people were wondering how we were going to respond so we tried to play a solid game and stay on them the whole game
4206297 any time you get beat its embarrassing and thats enough
4206298 and we can really use that as a tool to help us with our defense now and thats the name of the game because if you play good defense no matter how youre shooting the ball youre going to be in the game

4206300 from the beginning of the game we felt different the pace of the game the way we approached this game mentally we really wanted to get out from the jump ball
4206301 this barmy window that weve got it forces you to either put the club at risk financially or put it at risk football wise if youre not one of the big four clubs
4206302 were not and we try to do our best in every aspect without putting the club at risk we havent got the resources of some of the huge premier league clubs
4206303 what this window does in crazy the sooner they get rid of that the better
4206304 weve got offers in for two players one of which has been in for a long time i would presume weve got to move on from that one
4206305 with the other offer were hopeful that will come off but if it doesnt well go with what weve got
4206306 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4206307 i think hes been a victim of a board thats come in given him a lot of money and wanted success immediately
4206308 he spent the money and unfortunately what he spent it on didnt bear fruit thats not his fault it was just bad luck with injuries i think hes got to be judged on what happens from now
4206309 somebodys got to be the favourite to get the sack first and unfortunately its him because of the demand at west ham for success but the odds on him going will soon change if we stick two or three quick wins together
4206310 its a slow process and youve got to build a foundation matthew upson summed it up the other day you cant just buy success in one season it takes time
4206311 time stood still for us for a year because everyone we tried to bring in in terms of knowledge and experience was injured
4206312 theres a determination to go where we wanted to go last season before it went wrong it was a frustrating season
4206313 all the impact players we bought to change games were always on the treatment table which was frustrating for everybody
4206314 you want your biggest weapons out there because you know at any stage of the game kieron dyer or craig bellamys pace could get you a goal
4206315 i think theres been less activity in the market this summer because were yet to see our transfers from last year play their part
4206316 if you look at the games theyve played collectively theres not even a season between them
4206317 if they play 20 games each this season there will be a completely different outcome
4206318 having them back alongside dean ashton and scott parker will be like new signings
4206319 its something he agreed with west ham hes a great player but obviously something wasnt right nobody knows what happened
4206320 i hate to sound that way but he took my mothers life and weve been waiting two years almost and we havent come to a conclusion yet
4206321 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4206322 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4206323 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4206324 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4206325 this is a member state of the united nations and its internationally recognized borders need to be respected
4206326 the provisional cease fire that was agreed to really must go into place and that means that military activities have to cease
4206327 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4206328 this is a step toward real security for poland in the future
4206329 it looks as if were near agreement and we hope to make a joint announcement today
4206330 concerning the permanent presence of patriots missiles that will be able to effectively protect our territory
4206331 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4206332 this is a step toward real security for poland in the future
4206333 it looks as if were near agreement and we hope to make a joint announcement today
4206334 concerning the permanent presence of patriots missiles that will be able to effectively protect our territory
4206335 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4206336 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4206337 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4206338 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4206339 est 19336 and the company name reiser said those packages of meat were included in the 1 2 million pounds nebraska beef recalled from its customers even though the agency omitted them from its news release
4206340 i really like being able to put the query logic directly into business layer code instead of being hidden away deep in the bowels of one off repositories or services without sacrificing testability in the domain and service layers
4206341 lincoln idolizing bush voting iraq war armchair general and soi disant libertarian
4206342 confirmed that the risks are on the downside for growth
4206343 if you think its hard youll do well if you feel its easy youre screwed up
4206344 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says and so i would consider that bluster coming from the foreign minister of russia and we will ignore it
4206345 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4206346 i will make you awesome in one absurdly action packed week
4206347 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4206348 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4206349 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4206350 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4206351 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4206352 these are a great bunch of guys and girls that attend this member only tourney

4206354 we want to give back to you our fans and friends so we got the owner to make this a free party for everyone attire is as casual sexy wild or as wacky as you want to be just be there
4206355 i cant wait to kick off the new college year and what better way than hanging out with hundreds of my friends and fans at blue moon nights
4206356 ten years ago when i joined the school i told abhinav that one day he will get an olympic medal and see he has proved himself he has really made everyone proud
4206357 we are also feeling like celebrities as people approach us to know more about him would you have interviewed us if he had not won
4206358 abhinav was very composed and reserved kind of student most of the time he was absent from the school due to his competitions but whenever he came back he was up to the mark in studies too
4206359 he was a very serious fellow and never used to talk much if he every spoke it was generally about his shooting and nothing else
4206360 abhinav was always self possessed and used to give very short crisp answers as he had a habit of retaining whatever he heard and never use to speak until required
4206361 his silence speaks volumes about the depth of his character
4206362 he scored 85 per cent marks in class x and 74 6 per cent in xii
4206363 we are going to screen four super hit films of dev sahib as his fans want to watch these films again we want his films to reach the masses and with this his autobiography will also get publicity
4206364 these films which are quite close to dev jis heart reflect the various eras and are liked by many people
4206365 it was quite difficult to select the movies as all are very good and no doubt can be viewed again and again
4206366 when dev sahab visited chandigarh last year a huge rush was seen at the hotel and the fans told about their love for him and his movies keeping in mind their choice the decision was taken to organise a film fest
4206367 i myself have seen guide for more then 50 times it is the only indian film to be invited by cannes film festival 2008 in classic section and was screened there with french and english subtitles to a packed house and is also ranked amongst the top 25 must see bollywood films
4206368 take jewel thief it is one of the best suspense thriller ever made as no one can get to know the end until watch the full film
4206369 this time dev ji wont be able to come as he is busy with casting of his new venture named chargesheet but will definitely try to get him here during the film festival to be organised next year
4206370 well invite dev anand for the film festival to be held in february next year and hope he can take some time from his busy schedule
4206371 its just to avoid even the appearance of any impropriety
4206372 it was better for everyone to have him in a different facility
4206373 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4206374 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4206375 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4206376 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4206377 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4206378 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4206379 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4206380 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4206381 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

4206386 as customers try new and increasingly complex wireless phone services and products such as playing mp3 files capturing still pictures or video or downloading ring tones they are more likely to call their provider for support
4206387 customer care centers and service representatives are under pressure to handle the increase in inquiries while still trying to understand and resolve the customers issue on the initial contact this can potentially increase the number of transfers and the hold times for customers with an increase in hold times providers run the risk of decreasing customer satisfaction and losing customers to other providers as switching levels are 83 percent higher among customers who are put on hold compared with those who are not
4206388 the fact that verizon wireless performs well in resolving issues with one contact is particularly noteworthy
4206389 overall customer care performance is three times higher among customers whose issues were resolved in one contact over the phone compared with those who had to contact their provider more than once for the same issue
4206390 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4206391 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4206392 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4206393 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4206394 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4206395 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4206396 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4206397 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4206398 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4206399 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4206400 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4206401 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4206402 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4206403 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4206404 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4206405 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4206406 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4206407 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4206408 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4206409 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4206410 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4206411 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

4206413 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4206414 extra vigil is being kept at public areas like railway station both bus stands sector 17 amp 43 airport secretariat and markets
4206415 we have deputed around 1100 personals from various offices and ngos for the same as we are taking all measures that the city sounds to be safe and silent
4206416 a check is also being conducted on the international calls
4206417 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4206418 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4206419 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4206420 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4206421 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4206422 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4206423 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4206424 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4206425 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4206426 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4206427 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4206428 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4206429 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4206430 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4206431 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4206432 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4206433 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4206434 unless you are working with an object database or a very simple db i dont know how you can avoid joins
4206435 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4206436 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4206437 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4206438 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4206439 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4206440 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4206441 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4206442 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4206443 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4206444 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4206445 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4206446 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4206447 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4206448 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4206449 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4206450 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4206451 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4206452 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4206453 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4206454 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4206455 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4206456 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4206457 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4206458 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4206459 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4206460 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4206461 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4206462 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4206463 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4206464 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4206465 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4206466 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4206467 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4206468 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4206469 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4206470 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4206471 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4206472 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4206473 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4206474 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4206475 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4206476 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4206477 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4206478 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4206479 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4206480 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4206481 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4206482 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4206483 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4206484 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4206485 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4206486 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4206487 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4206488 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4206489 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4206490 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4206491 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4206492 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4206493 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4206494 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges

4206496 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4206497 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4206498 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4206499 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4206500 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4206501 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4206502 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4206503 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4206504 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4206505 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4206506 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4206507 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4206508 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4206509 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4206510 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4206511 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4206512 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4206513 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4206514 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4206515 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4206516 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4206517 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4206518 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4206519 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4206520 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4206521 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4206522 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4206523 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4206524 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4206525 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4206526 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4206527 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4206528 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4206529 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4206530 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4206531 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4206532 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4206533 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4206534 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4206535 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4206536 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4206537 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4206538 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4206539 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4206540 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4206541 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4206542 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4206543 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4206544 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4206545 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4206546 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
4206547 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
4206548 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
4206549 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
4206550 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
4206551 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
4206552 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
4206553 i think what jeremys getting at and i apologize for putting words in your mouth jeremy is that if there is a business problem to be solved we should be avoiding solving technical problems especially when theyve already been solved well
4206554 it is time to say goodbye to our long held dollar bearish stance for about 10 years we have been negative on the dollar occasionally wrong but mostly right
4206555 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4206556 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4206557 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4206558 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4206559 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4206560 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4206561 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4206562 who are open to doing something on the production side
4206563 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4206564 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4206565 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4206566 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4206567 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4206568 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4206569 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4206570 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4206571 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4206572 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4206573 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4206574 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4206575 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4206576 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4206577 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4206578 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4206579 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4206580 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4206581 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4206582 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4206583 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4206584 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4206585 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4206586 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4206587 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4206588 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4206589 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4206590 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4206591 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4206592 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4206593 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4206594 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4206595 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4206596 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4206597 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4206598 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4206599 huy kamusta ka na naaalala mo pa ba ako ikaw kasi naaalala kita hinanap nga kita eh pero hindi ko naman alam kung bakit
4206600 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
4206601 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4206602 keeps validation out of the domain and into a service object
4206603 from all appearances its always looked like the ef team was completely blowing off our original concerns about the usability of ef
4206604 oh on the other hand i guess we could just all do everything with nhibernate changing all of our properties to be overrideable and working with objects that arent really our objects at all but are generated proxy objects man i can see the hypocrisy in calling for poco when we have to deal with that kind of crap can anyone else
4206605 what is this set based algebra you speak of and how can i learn more
4206606 hey guys we still arent going to have poco in v1
4206607 alt net is for purists those who value perfection over practicality
4206608 alt net is for pragmatists those who value maintainability over dogma
4206609 what i do care is that now i can create a model that can be used across my programming environment my reporting solution and other areas i dont have a need for yet
4206610 shame on all of you please exit the industry at the earliest possible convenience
4206611 i have all this accumulated knowledge and experience and no one wants to employ it and im not sure why
4206612 that im of no further use to my country is why im considering australia that my former parliamentary colleagues seem not to want to appoint me to anything but are quite happy to accommodate others who have left or are about to so as to shut them up from whingeing from the sidelines in election year
4206613 politics was never my ambition i was coaxed into it by others
4206614 that i succeeded in politics was as much a surprise to me as anyone im too tarnished as a former transsexual politician to be taken any more seriously in entertainment than dancing with the stars a show that has its own downside to deal with as a former contestant
4206615 it seems that i am not valued for my experience in either local or central government so i guess i wasted 14 years of my life in publicly elected service and ended up unemployable
4206616 which is why oz is looking very attractive to me i cant shake off my fame here im not so well known there perhaps ill have a better chance being a famous tranny will always have its negatives
4206617 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4206618 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4206619 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4206620 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4206621 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4206622 for i will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sin no more
4206623 i learned fast you cant sell to cowboys they have no money
4206624 you have to appeal to the cowboy in everyone and sell to them
4206625 one of the biggest impressions on me is elvis presley he wore rockmount shirts
4206626 i never wanted to be the richest man in the cemetery
4206627 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
4206628 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
4206629 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4206630 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4206631 these are all small things and they all add up
4206632 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4206633 hated the score the animation the shots the characters and most of all the retarded idiot story
4206634 the grinding sectarian war pushed us to flee from iraq few athletes were able to pursue their careers this is wrong sports is a form of art a call for beauty creativity and excellence
4206635 we decided to stay and work in syria because of the continued killing liquidation and bloodshed to which iraqi professors are being subjected back home we prefer to work and settle down in arab countries rather than go to the west
4206636 we feel at the moment a greater concern for our safety
4206637 thats why every installation of the western world on the polish territory has its meaning because it anchors poland more deeply to the west
4206638 it seems that the americans have changed their view due to the situation in the caucasus
4206639 in the eyes of washington this conflict has proven that russia isnt a stable partner and continues to consider its international surroundings as its exclusive sphere of influence
4206640 with russian tanks rolling into georgia theres a feeling among former eastern bloc states that the tanks could roll over their borders too
4206641 our arguments about the need for a permanent presence of us troops and missiles on polish soil have been taken seriously by the american side
4206642 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4206643 the world is too fragile a basket for the human race to place all its eggs
4206644 science if not the enemy of social or economic conscience any more than reason is the enemy of faith
4206645 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4206646 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life
4206647 my comment to him was if dara can do it we can do it
4206648 im not going to win any medals for what i am doing
4206649 the sex and the city people are fun but its important to remember that its entertainment
4206650 ill take samanthas kim cattralls character body any day she looks fantastic but at the end of the day she doesnt inspire me
4206651 many people consider those celebrities completely separated from the world in which they live
4206652 there are times when i feel 40 and i feel like theres a piano on my back and i cant lift my arms up out of the pool and there are times when i feel like im 20 and just flying through the water
4206653 shes inspiring but shes not going to keep me going
4206654 it has to be my own decision and own choice its easy when you have a lot going on to make excuses it comes down to your own personal dedication
4206655 sem prestar aten o no que vai acontecer l na frente
4206656 ter de fazer um aperto nos gastos que este governo ainda n o fez como o quadro geral mundial estar pior do que o atual ser uma heran a pesada para o pr ximo governo
4206657 a taxa de investimento baixa no brasil o investimento p blico continua baixo apesar de todas as propagandas do pac que eu chamo de plano de acelera o da comunica o porque mais fala do que faz n s temos problemas de infra estrutura problemas nos portos problemas de gera o de energia que j est atrasada
4206658 ela foi necess ria porque n o houve conten o da expans o do gasto p blico ficando s por conta do banco central o controle da infla o o banco central n o tem outro instrumento sen o aumentar os juros
4206659 e isso n o est sendo feito agora como parece que a press o inflacion ria sobretudo dos produtos de alimenta o ficou um pouco menor quem sabe o banco central n o imp e ainda mais altas taxas de juros o que acarretar evidentemente na redu o da taxa de crescimento
4206660 ao saber disso decidi que o dinheiro fosse usado na diplomacia taiuanesa
4206661 este envio nada tem a ver com nenhum dos casos dos quais eu e minha fam lia somos acusados
4206662 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4206663 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4206664 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4206665 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4206666 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4206667 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4206668 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4206669 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4206670 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4206671 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens

4206682 the only vehicle through which progressives can begin the process of rebuilding a mass black led movement for real social change
4206683 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviors that we see in whole organisms
4206684 this project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviors but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons hopefully we can use that to go some of the way to answer some of these very fundamental questions
4206685 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4206686 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4206687 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4206688 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through

4206749 politics was never my ambition i was coaxed into it by others
4206750 that i succeeded in politics was as much a surprise to me as anyone im too tarnished as a former transsexual politician to be taken any more seriously in entertainment than dancing with the stars a show that has its own downside to deal with as a former contestant
4206751 it seems that i am not valued for my experience in either local or central government so i guess i wasted 14 years of my life in publicly elected service and ended up unemployable

4206844 and losing your way on a journey is unfortunate but losing your reason for the journey is a fate more cruel
4206845 so dont be afraid to make mistakes to stumble and fall because most of the time the greatest rewards come from doing the things that scare you the most maybe youll get everything you wish for maybe youll get more than you ever could have imagined who knows where life will take you the road is long and in the end the journey is the destination
4206846 there comes a time when life goes off course in this desperate moment you must choose your direction will you fight to stay on the path while others tell you who you are or will you label yourself will you be honored by your choice or will you embrace your new path each morning you choose to move forward or to simply give up

4206849 the important thing is not to be bitter over lifes disappointments learn to let go of the past and recognize that every day wont be sunny and when you find yourself lost in the darkness and despair remember its only in the black of night you see the stars and those stars will lead you back home
4206850 the person that you want to be does exist somewhere in the other side of hard work and faith and belief and beyond the heartache and fear of what life has

4206859 the young woman has seen so much pain in her short life it makes me appreciate the things ive always taken for granted
4206860 when you go after infant mortality youre not going after polio like the march of dimes did youre going after life
4206861 infant mortality is a manifestation of the accumulated social inadequacies that we have tolerated historically
4206862 is it because these babies are black that somehow people care less
4206863 infant deaths in this nation account for more deaths than all of the other causes of death combined for children up to the age of 18 we should be marching we should be absolutely indignant about those numbers

4206884 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4206885 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4206886 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about

4206889 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4206890 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
4206891 these patients had been through experimental treatments so it is not like we got anybody who had standard of care left dr weichselbaum said

4206898 hey i could heal that guy back up who just got hit by that aoe but ill let the druid do it instead and preserve my mana

4206904 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

4206913 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4206914 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4206915 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years

4206917 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

4206952 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4206953 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4206954 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4206955 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4206956 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4206957 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4206958 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4206959 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4206960 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4206961 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4206962 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4206963 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4206964 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

4206972 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4206973 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4206974 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4206975 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4206976 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4206977 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4206978 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year

4206986 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4206987 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced

4206991 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4206992 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4206993 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4206994 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4206995 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

4207023 the weather pattern from now through saturday night will result in ozone pollution rising to unhealthy levels
4207024 i had been with john for about three years he was a really nice guy and i enjoyed being with him but there wasnt a ton of passion most everyone we knew had gotten engaged and though john would have proposed in a second whenever he brought it up id change the subject i took a trip to australia for work and while i was gone i got together with a co worker to whom id always been insanely attracted i had a fantastic trip probably because for the first time in a long time i experienced that excitement id been missing i broke up with john soon after i returned home and began dating the guy from the trip even though im not super proud of my actions things ended up for the best after dating for a few years the guy from the trip and i got married and were incredibly happy together
4207025 right before i was going to break up with my ex sean he found out that he had to put his beloved dog to sleep he was so broken up about it that i didnt have the heart to end things so i waited a month or so until he was in better shape when things seemed to be better and i was ready he lost his job so i felt like i was back to square one by that time i had met someone else that i really wanted to start seeing so i went ahead and did it i eventually ended things never telling sean about my extra curricular dating i think i rationalized that i was trying to spare his feelings
4207026 my boyfriend greg and i decided to do the long distance thing after i was accepted to a graduate program 200 miles from where we lived the first few months were fine but i soon found myself becoming extremely attracted to my lab partner henry what began as innocent flirting eventually wound up with us in bed after the program was over i returned home to greg being with him was really difficult but i didnt break up with him initially because i was still attracted to him too i visited henry a few times and realized that he was really more of a fling probably born out of boredom and that greg was the one for me i eventually stopped communicating with henry i never told greg about what happened which occasionally makes me feel guilty but i chalk my cheating up to being young and silly he and i are still together four years since my program ended
4207027 i began dating eric shortly after i had been dumped by dave my boyfriend of two years i was devastated and eric was definitely a rebound thing after eric and i had dated for five months dave came back and wanted to give things another shot i still really missed him so i began seeing him but never ended things with eric i think i sort of kept eric around for insurance purposes just in case things didnt end up well with dave dave and i didnt make it on round two and after eric discovered through mutual friends that i had been seeing him again he ended things with me i definitely learned my lesson about dating two guys at the same time not to mention trying to rekindle a relationship thats just plain over
4207028 when i was younger i dated a guy named ethan who was really critical of me he constantly made little snide comments about my weight how stupid i was and how clumsy i was for whatever odd reason i was into him despite the fact that all of my friends and family hated him one weekend when he was away i met will at a party and we completely hit it off he was the complete opposite of ethan kind sweet and generous yet completely cool and fun too we hung out all weekend and it was like a light bulb went off in my head this is how mature relationship worthy guys act i hooked up with will the night before he left and broke up with ethan soon after will and i dated for three years and now were married
4207029 im from florida so i adore going to the beach and boating but my former boyfriend chris a total city boy hated it we always argued about where wed take trips and he always won about eight months into our dating i took a trip to key west with my friends and we chartered a boat for the day the captain of the boat was this totally hot complete beach guy for life type and i spent the whole day flirting with him we met him out that night and he and i got together i never told chris about it after i got home and i never felt guilty i think part of me felt like thats what chris got for being so stubborn chris and i didnt make it and after we broke up i made sure any future boyfriends loved the beach
4207030 my last boyfriend was a total player before we got together i thought i could change him but i was wrong i always heard rumors that he was hooking up with other girls while we were dating but he always denied it one night i got a call from a girl he had been seeing and she detailed their three month long relationship to me and told me about another girl she had discovered he was seeing as well i was so mad that i went out with my friends that night dressed to kill and went home with the hottest guy i could find i felt like it was the least he deserved i loved seeing the look on his face when i told him about what i did and that i knew about the other girls and then i dumped him
4207031 in some ways your persona is the balance of an object at rest metaphysically you appreciate the space between activities so your persona reflects that kind of calm this contemplative expression indicates that you can achieve a balance between your physical life and your soul life as you learn to work with duality in a conscious way your persona becomes calmer and you are able to effect change in the world without stirring up the energy more than necessary the tendency to balance and calm is part of what makes you a welcome guest you can be counted on to enrich conversation both by listening actively and participating with clear questions ideas and an occasional opinion you cultivate harmony among the people around you and thus make a strong team member who can be counted on to keep the goal in mind in the midst of discussion as your spiritual path unfolds you find that your sexual and other material desires change you are still a physical beings with needs and desires but your motivations take on the quality of spiritual aspiration instead of engaging in sex for the sake of sex you seek partners who share a spiritual affinity that allows you both to experience ecstasy through your relationship sometimes this even means engaging in activities that transcend the physical realm without using physical contact as the avenue of approach sometimes we see an older couple hanging out together they dont seem to talk very much but we can see that they are attuned to each other they investigate whatever catches the eye pointing out things to each other they are calm not rushing their activity but following its natural pace the outer appearance reflects an inner spiritual attunement that is the hallmark of the libra ascendant libra ascendants are vulnerable to any excess that throws the physical body out of harmony this can result in a variety of ailments involving the kidneys bladder and sexual organs you can enjoy life best by exercising s degree of moderation in this way you demonstrate respect for yourself and your partner on the physical and spiritual level
4207032 you have already taken a few steps on the spiritual path and you have dedicated your life to your spiritual nature to some degree the intense desire nature within you continues however to pull you toward the physical expression you constantly find yourself at a turning point between pursuing a material desire and following a more spiritual inclination you have the capacity for major changes in your life others may find your decisions remarkable as you can take a 180 degree turn with relative ease each of these major shifts brings you closer to understanding the unfolding plan of your spiritual life at this time you may appear to be motivated only by material desires but each turning takes you further on the spiritual path if you look back you can see that your decisions have all blended into one direction you see the logical unfolding of spirit woven into seemingly disjointed actions and decisions first you test your physical appetites with food sexual desire and physical comfort these may become rather boring ambition and the desire for power increase the emotional thrill and the momentary pay off at the third stage you tackle mental challenges of spiritual pride if you can transcend all three levels you then function from a more spiritual base you cease to seek physical emotional and mental thrills for their own sake and use your personal power to transform your own life and to help others you face a tall order if you are to make spiritual progress you need to remember your own beginnings as you seek success in any of your endeavors spiritual or otherwise
4207033 you are a natural diplomat reasonable tolerant fair always willing to listen to varying viewpoints and ready to see the other side of an issue
4207034 you are very strong willed and proud but intensely private and not easy to know well behind your quiet exterior lies a great deal of emotional depth sensitivity complexity and also fierce determination when you want something you go after it rather quietly but insistently and wholeheartedly and you usually get it you are not a person who lives lightly or superficially you want to live passionately and intensely and are not averse to challenge danger or to facing the darker side of life human pain and struggle you function well in crisis situations and often seek them out for you enjoy the feeling of living at full capacity you are very intuitive about other people and especially about their unspoken feelings and hidden motives you usually have strong immediate gut reactions either positive or negative which prove to be correct you approach life very instinctively and are not always fully conscious of why you feel or act as you do you also have a very strong affinity with animals an acute sensitivity and a nonverbal kind of rapport with them in relation to others you are rather cautious sometimes even suspicious until you get to know and trust them and trust doesnt come easily to you when you commit yourself emotionally to someone be it friend or lover you are intensely loyal and devoted to them and you also expect the same kind of unwavering undying loyalty in return if you are ever betrayed by someone you care deeply for you are capable of hating and retaliating with as much fervor as you once loved nothing is done halfway in fact you are intensely involved and often jealously attached to whatever you care about be it person idea or cause there is definitely a streak of emotional fanaticism in you because of your natural reserve others may see you as something of an enigma you are quite self protective and often defensive you are also very magnetic especially to members of the opposite sex
4207035 one of the greatest challenges we face with multi platform games is how to deliver an equally fantastic experience across each platform
4207036 with x blades weve taken time to ensure the same intense hack and slash gameplay is delivered seamlessly on all platforms
4207037 it just seems to me that john edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
4207038 what is clear is that many companies are facing a very complicated situation in which they have bought land getting seriously in debt to do so and that in todays world you have to pay the money back so if they are not getting any money from their principle business which is the sale of property what they have to do is get rid of dead weight that is to get rid of certain assets they may have

4207044 by seizing the opportunity to pound georgia with air strikes and military incursions vladimir putin russias prime minister is sending an emphatic message with global consequences the curtain has fallen on the era when nato steadily expanded into eastern europe and onwards to embrace the former republics of the soviet union and russia was able to respond with nothing more than bluster the balance of power in europe has fundamentally changed
4207045 we want to go back home but i get afraid when i think about it
4207046 i wish somebody could guarantee that there wont be any shooting when we get home were ready to go back but we are so afraid
4207047 there will be a process for dealing with what has been a difficult conflict in south ossetia and in abkhasia but it proceeds of course from un security council resolutions that are already there
4207048 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we negotiated with mr medvedev well then lets begin the withdrawal of russian troops this is what was in doubt the situation will slowly improve
4207049 this is intended to support families who are struggling and businesses in this way we want to lay the groundwork for the best possible economic recovery which we hope will happen within a reasonable time scale
4207050 the prime minister looked pathetic projecting an image of one incapable of solving this economic crisis
4207051 some of the barriers are so large that i dont think anyone can make a clear estimate on a time line to surmount them but hopefully with market participation policy incentives and a lot of private money backing these groups the solutions will come to market sooner rather than later
4207052 three to five years is what ive been hearing since 2004
4207053 when you vote with the pocketbook all of a sudden you have this empowered american consumer which is probably the largest force for change on the face of the earth right now
4207054 we are going to have to come to terms with that and think about what our options are
4207055 i am not a social scientist but i think any of us can speculate on the kind of crises that can multiply out of resource shortages in terms of famine social unrest and war those are the choices that are going to become more and more stark over the coming decades if we dont do smarter things about our energy infrastructure
4207056 for a little company like ours this is a scary time
4207057 and i really fear that we are going to lose this opportunity
4207058 we are talking about thousands of systems that could go into washington state in the next three to five years and i think i am being conservative on that
4207059 and i think it is recognized especially in the clean tech space as having a delta between the level of rhetoric and the level of action which is disappointing

4207063 there are rumours that apple may be working on a fix to this problem if that pans out contrary to the analysts report it would turn out that its not a hardware problem at all just a firmware issue and immature firmware from apple
4207064 whats the best way to cut my hand off to free myself from this bear trap before i starve to death in the wilderness
4207065 we dont have enough space on our log drive and i need to free it up often
4207066 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head back and saw big flames
4207067 we rushed to the site and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burnt prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4207068 the outstanding sales result for august once again demonstrates the economic value the oil and gas industry has for our province
4207069 these sales are a positive indication that b c s leading environmental policies which include legislation for a cap and trade system and the elimination of routine flaring at oil and gas producing wells has provided a level playing field and certainty to industry

4207071 the communication between all of the different agencies is really good
4207072 but you cant predict crowds the preparations are in place but thats just on paper its really hard to say what would happen if there was a disaster
4207073 i just think many of the guys on the ground are frustrated at the politics involved in it all whether its the gang officer the fugitive guys the swat folks or the patrol officers on the street none have expressed to me fear about their own personal safety they feel that theres plenty of security but the need to keep everything quiet and buttoned up has forced a level of frustration regarding the ability to be prepared and to know whats expected of them if they are not yet in the need to know phase so theyre just sitting back and waiting for orders
4207074 dont worry when the moment comes i will lead my platoon to victory

4207077 the outcome of six grim days of bloodshed in the caucasus has triggered an outpouring of the most nauseating hypocrisy from western politicians and their captive media
4207078 is unacceptable in the 21st century could these by any chance be the leaders of the same governments that in 2003 invaded and occupied along with georgia as luck would have it the sovereign state of iraq on a false pretext at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives or even the two governments that blocked a ceasefire in the summer of 2006 as israel pulverised lebanons infrastructure and killed more than a thousand civilians in retaliation for the capture or killing of five soldiers
4207079 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced
4207080 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust

4207083 these initial test results from popa 2 are exciting confirming a new exploration play initially identified on our lands in 2006
4207084 the rio magdalena block is a large block near existing infrastructure with numerous leads and prospects for further testing as our confidence in this new exploration play continues to mature
4207085 weve corrected quite a bit on oil despite a lot of bullish news the sentiment has been bearish
4207086 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or sea ports to conduct this mission
4207087 what we are focused on at this point is getting humanitarian relief to the people who need it in georgia
4207088 the role of the u s military is strictly to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of this conflict
4207089 i think that other teams known fear us because of our results against some of the bigger nations
4207090 you need to win your home games to give yourself a chance of progressing however and weve tended to do better away from home in recent seasons
4207091 weve played a counter attacking game and soaked up the pressure in those matches so maybe itll suit us to have our opening two matches against macedonia and iceland away from home next month
4207092 i think wed be pretty happy if we managed to come out of that with four points that would set us up nicely people here look at them as small countries but theyre up and coming
4207093 however its really important that we beat northern ireland at hampden next week because that will give us more confidence to take into those ties
4207094 i enjoyed that but i would enjoy it more as a participant
4207095 i like the pressure of playing in big games and they dont come any bigger than the world cup
4207096 we were too young and foolish to know that what we were doing wasnt how things were done

4207098 wolff railed that design and designers were incapable of challenging issues or changing minds because their collective arsenal of alternative cliches which has not changed in decades is the same as mainstream ones which they sought to subvert he further admonished the audience against doing anything if the result was not extraordinary instead he said just read books lots of books the thud of 200 plus jaws dropping was audible throughout the audience
4207099 valid and needed criticism from within the field is often seen as tainted by overt prejudices which often results in vituperative argument on blogs and elsewhere so the most constructive aspect of this public critique was the fact that despite wolffs acerbic take no prisoners tone issues were raised myths were challenged criticism did not kill the discourse instead it gave it new life
4207100 teaching then wasnt a method of telling students all about what i knew because the only thing i knew about was design process instead teaching became a way for me to learn and to structure theories processes methods and opinions about design void of the business context teaching is a way to explore

4207119 this barmy window that weve got it forces you to either put the club at risk financially or put it at risk football wise if youre not one of the big four clubs
4207120 were not and we try to do our best in every aspect without putting the club at risk we havent got the resources of some of the huge premier league clubs

4207122 weve got offers in for two players one of which has been in for a long time i would presume weve got to move on from that one

4207126 we didnt have a violin program we had flutes it was hard for us to win
4207127 all those little things make the difference we want it to be the best quality everything that l a new york and miami has we have
4207128 those are the things you got to deal with as a producer and stuff like that
4207129 you cant get mad because at the end of the day hes the customer and hes the one whos paying you
4207130 being a musician you only have a career for so long im realistic i get more enjoyment from mixing arranging everything that comes with producing
4207131 im not rushing anything i like where i am now but its not about working for a bigger or better company i love working for studio one because i can express myself and just be me but everything runs its course
4207132 i think i read a manual on how to record but really i just figured things out myself i think of my talent as a gift i hope its a gift
4207133 my father was shocked by how the song was arranged and how the beat was laid out they were both like you really
4207134 that back there is one of the best producers in the valley
4207135 dewayne has consistently put out quality stuff ive always been a fan of his work he produces music in the valley that has a national quality to it
4207136 i heard a recording by golightly and in comparison with everything else it sounded clearer
4207137 i hear vocals in my head before the music unlike most producers
4207138 sometimes my songs come out the best when i feel a certain way sometimes i dont trust my ear so i dont mean just listen to the sound or the quality sometimes it wont make sense to my ear but inside itll just say leave it alone because of the way itll make you feel
4207139 the energy of being on stage is theres this feeling i cant explain its something that im infatuated with
4207140 making something that was horrible into something thats hot taking something that was broken and fixing it
4207141 like someone will say here i broke my moms favorite jar and i glue all the pieces together so thats my satisfaction
4207142 once i started figuring those things out i was taking them apart and putting them back together you know i was kind of hooked
4207143 then i got a 4 track well my friend had a 4 track and i went over his house to play with it and that was just the coolest thing id ever messed with
4207144 hes one of those people whos really easy to work with he has a lot of ideas and he has a fresh perspective hes not jaded
4207145 i like to think of myself as a temporary member of the band im working with
4207146 together we built it from this acoustic song to this huge arrangement
4207147 then at the end of the song we did these huge group vocals so we were there until like three in the morning and doing like 20 takes of all of them singing together so it sounded like this huge choir
4207148 producers and engineers are judged by the albums that they make and the bands that they work with so you could do a really good job on a not so great band but nobodys heard about them and thats not seen as good as doing an okay job on a band thats you know either really cool or really well known
4207149 being a producer is like being able to join a lot of different bands without the long term commitment its like all the good stuff about it like being challenged creatively by other people learning peoples new ideas collaborating its really rewarding
4207150 and none of the bad stuff like its without the you know hey dude can i borrow your car
4207151 i hate teenagers they are unreliable of course im only a dog what do i know
4207152 the outstanding sales result for august once again demonstrates the economic value the oil and gas industry has for our province

4207154 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4207155 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
4207156 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
4207157 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
4207158 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
4207159 the findings of the israeli investigation are confusing and offer no convincing explanation of the circumstances that led to the reuters cameramans death
4207160 only an impartial analysis of what happened would be able to prevent this kind of tragedy from recurring instead of reassuring the press the israeli military is fostering an unacceptable climate of fear and danger
4207161 if journalists are wearing flak jackets keeping a reasonable distance from the belligerents and clearly displaying press markings there should be a change in the behaviour of the soldiers in areas where civilians including journalists are present
4207162 i think hes been a victim of a board thats come in given him a lot of money and wanted success immediately
4207163 he spent the money and unfortunately what he spent it on didnt bear fruit thats not his fault it was just bad luck with injuries i think hes got to be judged on what happens from now
4207164 somebodys got to be the favourite to get the sack first and unfortunately its him because of the demand at west ham for success but the odds on him going will soon change if we stick two or three quick wins together
4207165 its a slow process and youve got to build a foundation matthew upson summed it up the other day you cant just buy success in one season it takes time
4207166 time stood still for us for a year because everyone we tried to bring in in terms of knowledge and experience was injured

4207169 you want your biggest weapons out there because you know at any stage of the game kieron dyer or craig bellamys pace could get you a goal
4207170 i think theres been less activity in the market this summer because were yet to see our transfers from last year play their part
4207171 if you look at the games theyve played collectively theres not even a season between them
4207172 if they play 20 games each this season there will be a completely different outcome

4207181 while he was training for the olympics she told him she was staying in but then he would read in page six that she was out with celebrities like lindsay lohan it was too distracting and he decided it better to focus on training and bringing home the gold for the us
4207182 if that doesnt trigger need for a special prosecutor i cant imagine what would
4207183 sending him to canada could have posed a threat to our country
4207184 sending maher to syria instead of home to canada was certainly not safer for him and did nothing to make the united states safer

4207215 a big challenge for biological therapeutics is that they are broken down rapidly in the body the technology developed by asterion ltd is based on basic structural biology work that has provided us with the knowledge necessary to develop longer acting drugs this is a major advantage for patients as it means monthly injections rather than daily injections
4207216 our patented and versatile therapeutic platform technology profuse tm could also tackle major diseases such as some cancers anaemia infertility and diabetes under normal circumstances hormones of the type known as cytokine hormones growth hormone for example circulate in the blood and are bound to proteins that prevent them from being degraded the basic structural biology work we have done in the past means that we can see the interaction between the hormone and the binding protein in exquisite detail our understanding of this structural information means that we can rationally design drugs that consist of this pairing of hormone and binding protein that still allows them to activate the cell surface receptor in this situation the hormone portion of the drug is better protected in the circulation from degradation and so it has a much longer effective life in the body

4207238 the company involved in the super exciting haynesville shale region which could be one of the largest domestic on shore natural gas fields ever
4207239 the stock has been coming on lately as more investors learn about the companys potential in the haynesville shale region
4207240 discovered in march of this year the haynesville field according to energy and capital could conservatively hold 168 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
4207241 there was always a notion that a big find was in the space that the company currently owns 2 700 acres but when it was first explored back in the 1950 crude oil prices were much lower and there was no technology to get to the natural gas
4207242 most folks dont realize that there is a gold rush in domestic resources going on right now in part to new technologies to find and drill for crude oil and natural gas this has created a fantastic problem of no rigs and too few pipelines
4207243 this makes the deal with petrohawk so special another element to the arrangement is the fact that petrohawk will pay all expenses associated with drilling the first well the financial arrangement will be 60 40 with mainland getting the latter
4207244 that is a very favorable ratio for a junior resource company and it means they may not have to go to the public for additional funding that would dilute present shareholders there are some analysts that think this is a 9 stock but i think it could be a 13 stock by the end of this year
4207245 i interviewed the ceo of petrohawk in june when i anchored cavuto on the fox business network and natural gas is going to play a prominent role in our energy use for decades to come
4207246 in fact i spent time with t boone pickens last month in wyoming and his plan is more about natural gas to run our cars than wind mills to power our electric grid i also spoke with the ceo of mainland and his optimism is clear
4207247 of course this is a small cap play and cash flow may not begin until late in the year so there are greater than average risks
4207248 that may explain why the shorts have been on the attack right now im told there is a 20 million share naked short position that is a significant amount of folks that may have to cover in a hurry
4207249 technically the stock has room to 8 00 and through there i think that the shorts will begin to cover and the stock should rally to 10 00 fairly quickly our long term price target is 13 00
4207250 for schwab it doesn t matter whether the market goes up or down it s just matters that the market keeps on chugging along
4207251 investing in schwab is like betting with the casino and not the gambler and those kinds of odds i ll take any day fact is all that matters is that stock and options traders keep plying their trade
4207252 and well they have increased trading activity helped schwab post better results for the last quarter and that trading surge has continued into july with average daily trades to date already 7 9 higher than in june
4207253 moreover the growth in the individual investing sector is huge you see companies are increasingly putting the responsibility for retirement planning back on their employees
4207254 so as baby boomers retire en masse and increasingly get more involved in the management of their own investment accounts they have to find someplace to turn for sound investment advice
4207255 of course the big players in this field are combination brokerage houses and investment banks
4207256 most often when volatility in the markets goes up so does trading volume this record sized volatility right now is driving almost record setting levels of trading in options and derivatives in particular one reason the company is so strong is that its business is well diversified
4207257 in addition to its trading dominance schwab was also a pioneer in the area of no transaction fee mutual funds making the company one of the three largest u s managers of mutual funds alongside fidelity and vanguard
4207258 and while the second quarter results were lauded it s the company s underlying performance that really deserves attention schwab s exceptional second quarter report demonstrates that the company remains successful at attracting new accounts and assets this is a key factor
4207259 during the three months that ended june 30 schwab added 226 000 new client accounts and 26 billion in new assets boosting its total client assets to 1 4 trillion this is almost a perfect storm in which the market is actually driving stock and option trading
4207260 and here s what makes the outlook even better the company just announced that it s increasing its quarterly dividend by 6 cents a share
4207261 no doubt a dividend increase of this size indicates the company s bullish outlook for the future increases are hardly ever made unless management is certain the new payout can be maintained and 20 is a substantial increase
4207262 and then there s the 32 return on equity for schwab it s likely one of the most enviable roes in the business the firm weathered the market storm fantastically and now its diversification into asset management and advisory services is paying off
4207263 its okay for you to be a nerd just keep it a secret until much much later okay
4207264 as soon as it turns into something that is it isnt shit right now ill admit that but it could become a tropical depression any time now and then it then it could threaten millions all the way up to maine

4207266 im not really sure where it is even does anybody have a track on that fucker doing here folks the god damned seasons almost half over and we dont really have shit to show for it hey hey thats not part of the news conference turn that fucking thing off i said turn that god damned thing off or ill shove it right up your ass

4207274 they fear it could force ordinary canadians to pay thousands of dollars in penalties for copying their own legally purchased music to cds or uploading videos to sharing sites such as youtube
4207275 the question is who gains from this bill its not musicians musicians dont need lawsuits what we do need is a government that is willing to sit down with all the stakeholders and craft a balanced copyright policy for canada that will not repeat the mistakes made in the united states
4207276 the concern expressed by tens of thousands of canadians is that calls for balance have not been heard drowned out by the vocal lobbying from the u s and well connected lobby groups
4207277 the conservative government campaigned in 2006 on a platform of government accountability and transparency to put an end to these forms of secretive influence if the copyright bill proceeds without addressing public concerns and before conducting the promised house of commons review of the wipo treaties canadians will be left to ask whether prentices plan is a made in canada solution or as it appears a bill that was born in the u s a

4207292 the investigation found an inability on the part of the ministry to learn from valuable lessons
4207293 that the basic elements of child welfare were not consistently carried out to the level reasonably expected or as called for the ministrys service standards

4207300 since he wasnt aware of his actions and was manipulated into destroying an entire species should he be punished or locked up to ensure that no one else can aim the gun that is ender at someone else
4207301 anyone who does anything that drives people away from the gods is a liar and through faith and discipline you will achieve omniscience

4207323 for the court to take such extraordinary action on its own indicates the importance the judges place on the case and means that maher may finally see justice in this country
4207324 where the idea of a work contributes almost nothing to the democratic dialogue and it is only its expression which is meaningful
4207325 distribution is deficient there are absolutely no reserves they havent even done public bidding for health supplies imagine taking power aug 15 and finding no medications or diesel fuel it is a country that could go up in flames within two or three months this is why we say there is a kind of conspiracy to leave state institutions nonfunctioning
4207326 there are backward looking factions within this party who aspire to come back to power early and not democratically
4207327 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
4207328 he is realizing that sometimes you have to deal with the devil to govern
4207329 lugo probably concluded he needed at least short term marriage of convenience to get things done during the first 100 days that will be critical to get political traction and momentum
4207330 is a pretty conventional economist hes going to be reassuring to investors and the international financial community
4207331 the optimistic scenario is he wont accomplish much but he will be well regarded and respected by the people as a president who is not corrupt and does not take bribes
4207332 this endeavor could reinforce among the public a perception that the universitys faculty lacks intellectual and ideological diversity

4207367 it is unfortunate that many people business executives as well as so called security experts believe that the implementation of one or two security products can address security issues there cannot be a one size fits all approach to security as each environment is different with its own set of vulnerabilities and some security products themselves contain flaws which increase a networks vulnerability rather than reduce it
4207368 indeed if businesses are serious about security they need to understand that the only way to truly check that they are secure is to view the code thats one of the reasons i believe open source software is the better option for companies where security is of the utmost concern its not that open source is more secure but rather the fact that you can view the code see any vulnerabilities yourself and even fix if necessary if you have the skills to do so

4207376 union workers and officials at a tyson foods plant in tennessee said friday they have agreed to reinstate labor day as a paid holiday and the plant will also observe the muslim holiday eid al fitr this year tyson had previously agreed to drop labor day and substitute the muslim holiday as part of a new 5 year contract to accommodate muslim workers at the plant in shelbyville which is about 50 miles south of nashville the decision sparked widespread criticism from local politicians to talk radio to the internet the springdale ark based company said it requested reinstating labor day after complaints from plant workers and the public

4207403 the acquisition of westcon fits perfectly with our growth strategy which combines organic growth with acquisitions and leverages our industry reputation for quality and integrity on a regional level westcon operates in the same mold as transcat gaining the trust and respect of its customers
4207404 this acquisition provides us a west coast distribution operation that enables us to provide faster service to a broader base of potential customers while adding a pacific northwest full service calibration operation that geographically complements and expands our nationwide network to a total of twelve laboratories of added value is westcon s focus on the wind industry an ideal high growth target market that fits well with our energy market strategy
4207405 we believe that westcon s consultative value added culture which is very similar to ours should enable a smooth and rapid integration into our existing organization
4207406 our current customers will benefit measurably from this transaction by gaining access to a greater selection of quality instruments and a more diverse repair and calibration service offering and we will be able to compete very effectively to gain greater market share in our region importantly given transcat s resources we can also more aggressively pursue opportunities in the emerging wind energy sector

4207421 given cattle no longer graze horse butte at any time of year it is unnecessary for dol to force bison back into the park
4207422 residents across horse butte post signs saying that buffalo are welcome on their properties this year over 150 buffalo from horse butte were sent to slaughter even though there wasnt a cow in sight
4207423 bison are native wildlife in montana and are in critical need of habitat outside the park
4207424 practical solutions exist to provide native bison with habitat outside the park while also ensuring they dont commingle with livestock through their lawsuit the montana stockgrowers association is asserting that bison should never be able to leave the park even when cattle are not present
4207425 bison elk and other wildlife are doing what is needed to survive in heavy snow winters like the last one they migrate to lower elevation lands in search of grass this problem is not going away but there is a simple fix let buffalo graze on horse butte the montana stockgrowers association should be trying to work out a solution instead of bullying the state and running roughshod over the wishes of the property owners on horse butte with their heavy handed tactics
4207426 on behalf of all british columbians i offer my deepest sympathies to ms cases family friends and colleagues

4207455 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4207456 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties
4207457 thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4207458 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4207459 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4207460 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4207461 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits
4207462 more web sites are adopting recaptchas each day so the rate of transcription keeps growing

4207466 we are saddled with the painful but important task of completing the implementation of the international court of justices judgment by handing the bakassi peninsula to cameroon
4207467 i dont think cameroon will be in a hurry to exploit bakassis oil reserves since the security situation remains a great concern
4207468 nigeria recognizes the sovereignty of cameroon over the bakassi peninsula in accordance with the judgment of the international court of justice of 10 october 2002 in the matter of land and maritime boundary between cameroon and nigeria
4207469 it is an example that should serve as a model for the negotiated settlement of border disputes elsewhere
4207470 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
4207471 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
4207472 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts obviously its not working now we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track
4207473 we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
4207474 i believe this one is called bad word that rhymes with
4207475 unfairly presumed that small business owners are able to provide paid sick leave and dont want to

4207477 the new englanders rule for naming their children was straightforward names shoulder either be biblical or be descriptive in virtue the puritan samuel sewall recorded in his diary the criterion he used to choose a name i was struggling whether to call her sarah or mehetabel but when i saw sarahs tanding in the scripture i resolvd on that side some puritans were not as deliberate as sewall the bible seems to have been opened at random and the first name that was seen was immediately adopted writes leslie dunkling puritan birth records confirm this thesis in that they record names of biblical villains like judas jezebel and caiaphas
4207478 its up to them whether or not to do it but you know i believe they should respect this court and respect the constitution

4207482 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4207483 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4207484 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4207485 while watching the olympics opening night ceremonies i was delighted to see that printing was highlighted as one of ancient chinas four great inventions
4207486 we consider dip pen nanolithography which is nanotechnologys version of the quill pen and now polymer pen lithography to be two of northwesterns most important inventions
4207487 we can go in a sense from an ultra fine point sharpie to one with a fat tip
4207488 the tip of each polymer pen starts with nanometer scale sharpness but if we press down harder the tip flattens out this gives us great flexibility in the structures we can produce
4207489 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide
4207490 any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4207491 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4207492 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4207493 obesity has doubled over the past 20 years among preschool children the more data we collect on what contributes to this major public health problem the greater likelihood that we can help prevent it

4207506 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
4207507 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

4207510 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
4207511 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
4207512 i view it as another manifestation of the u s stock market slump
4207513 the underperformance of stocks and the drive for outsized return on equity is leading to investment distortions of the very worst sort we saw this in the mortgage market with their securities it got to a point that if the interest rate was high enough banks made the loan weve seen it in oil where the unattractiveness of stocks led institutions to dive into oil futures driving up prices well above historic gains and now it looks like public pension funds are catching the bug or flu
4207514 some of these high risk investment tactics will work but many wont but the bottom line is i dont think its an acceptable risk for a public pension fund its too much risk for their mission
4207515 these are public pension funds for civil servants teachers firemen police not supplemental investments for 20 million level accredited investors with a spare million or two to park

4207532 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected

4207545 crabtrees got a little knack on a dig route and theyre on the same page on this if the situations right instead of coming all the way across hell return when he does that hes wide open i think as theyre wandering around playing video games doing whatever they do some of that is rolling though their head it brings out some positive things
4207546 not to feel like there is a next step just grow in the system naturally like he did a year ago if he can throw for 36 touchdowns again to only eight interceptions i think were going to have a really good year
4207547 i think one of the harder things to coach a young guy in is pocket presence to stay in the pocket
4207548 well he already has that i think at times he can leave it a little bit more some of that will naturally happen as he gets comfortable with it
4207549 we probably put too much on him in 2007 because we werent doing well
4207550 we were trying to find something we could do early we probably gave him too much stuff and there were tipped balls and unfortunate balls early
4207551 i have to play better than i did last year at the same time the experience that i gained from last year is so important i know how to play the game honestly i felt like i became a much better quarterback than what i was

4207569 la gente tiene definitivamente un prejuicio contra los creyentes en la tierra plana
4207570 muchos usan el t rmino creer en la tierra plana como una forma abusiva y con connotaciones que implican fe ciega ignorancia o incluso contra el intelecto
4207571 alguna literatura sobre el tema de la sociedad de la tierra plana hace algunos a os

4207581 la teor a de la tierra plana es la teor a de la conspiraci n por excelencia
4207582 naturalmente los creyentes en la tierra plana piensan que los aterrizajes en la luna fueron falsificados al igual que las fotograf as de la tierra desde el espacio
4207583 siempre es bueno preguntarnos c mo sabemos lo que nosotros sabemos pero es tambi n bueno tener la capacidad de aceptar la evidencia convincente como las fotograf as de la tierra desde el espacio

4207615 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

4207624 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

4207644 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

4207741 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4207742 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4207743 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that

4207748 i wanted to tell you that i love you because you are indecisive that may see strange even to me but its true indecision may seem to a lot of people as a sign of negativity but to me that is not absolutely true for everybody yours is different it contains genuine sorrow genuine grief and anything genuine is passionate humane i am not saying that you should revel in your indecisions all i really want to say is that its okay because it will all come together for you and that the battle between taking left or right will one day end and you shall find peace

4207752 you mentioned that what i mean is what did you do once you saw that he was running away
4207753 she didnt do anything just picture yourself in that situation and consider how you would react
4207754 im not accusing her of anything arans teeth im not trying to accuse her of anything but we need to find out as much as we can about what happened

4207759 do we know whats in the book that was stolen
4207760 its an old treatise on weather control celestine and i were moving up to more advanced studies and i felt that it would be prudent to look up some of the likely outcomes you cant expect an apprentice to summon stormclouds without anticipating how thats going to affect the harvest season
4207761 all too well i think were definitely going to have to get this one back lady imogen
4207762 im not sure if i follow you cerise if its just a book on weather patterns and whatnot then wouldnt it be dispensable im rather certain that we have another copy somewhere we
4207763 zaphod was adamant about protecting the results of his studies the guild promised that no further copies of the book would ever be made and zaphod himself sealed it with an arcane lock it took me a good three weeks just to get the key from zerah the librarian
4207764 that doesnt change the fact that the thieves have a locked book in their hands i fail to see how this is an urgent situation
4207765 i dont think you deserve to underestimate their resourcefulness gharen
4207766 sooner or later someones going to find a way to get that book open
4207767 im sure that weather patterns may be important enough but what relevance would they have to anyone but us we could practically look for the book at our leisure
4207768 zaphod was a little overprotective of his research he didnt make that lock to protect the book he was of a far more retributive mindset
4207769 i got a long lecture from atharus before i could even attempt to open it
4207770 zaphod left only two specific keys by which the book could be properly unlocked and opened
4207771 did you ever hear about the hurricane eight years ago the one that hit the outskirts of lorendheim and continued for
4207772 i would much rather not have to trudge through seven feet of water at my age it would ruin my robes
4207773 but i wouldnt be asking you if i didnt think that you were up to the challenge
4207774 its got mage written all over it chance if you yanked it off one of the spellcasters then you know that i wont have truck with that
4207775 why dont you live a bit pick theyre not going to be able to find us were too good for those stuck up nobles besides it was fun and the girl was just as cute as she was stupid
4207776 i carried it here if it was supposed to blast me to pieces then it hasnt done that yet
4207777 i keep feeling like somethings going to fry me or turn my guts into warm mash
4207778 and it doesnt use the usual gear mechanism that you see nowadays in fact i dont know where the leather ends and the rust begins no the picks arent good for this kind of thing ill need my skeleton keys and right now theyre in my workshop
4207779 maybe two if the keys dont work you know chance this lock isnt directly attached to the cover you can take a sharp knife and just cut it away
4207780 but i think its got some nostalgic value maybe someonell pay more for it as long as it still has the lock
4207781 you could just sell it without having to open it
4207782 that way i save about a days worth of labor for someone who wont even pay me a fair cut
4207783 the way i see it theyre curious theyd die to find out whats inside if we can do that for them itll be like offering a service and theyd pay more in that case
4207784 speaking of which just how are you going to fence it you probably have a whole sect looking for it right now theyre not going to take very kindly to your walking around with their property
4207785 well ive got my people and youve got yours you just get your tools ready
4207786 im just a simple thief im not about to put my life on the line just because you had the bad sense to steal from a mage

4207807 ik moet constateren dat dit nieuwe zeer ernstige gegeven mij in de beeldvorming verder terug de jaren tachtig heeft ingezogen
4207808 the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants
4207809 perhaps 150 000 of those are loosely classified as skilled
4207810 a double or tripling of this number would markedly accelerate the absorption of unsold housing inventory for sale and hence help stabilize prices
4207811 realtors r build communities and care about the lack of affordable housing in many of our towns and cities
4207812 successful partnerships like this are crucial to developing comprehensive affordable housing plans that will help ashevilles residents successfully obtain and maintain quality affordable housing
4207813 in addition to raising funds to support our programs the kidney walk offers an excellent opportunity to raise public awareness about the kidney disease epidemic in our community
4207814 educating people about kidney disease and its leading causes diabetes and hypertension are central to our mission
4207815 there are so many corporate and black tie events in our area
4207816 i wanted to have an event where all people young and old can participate and show their support for the national kidney foundation in the faces of all the participants you can see the great strides nkf has made in the fight against kidney disease
4207817 living with diabetes creates an opportunity to take a challenge and turn it into something positive
4207818 this resource will help healthcare professionals lead people with diabetes on a journey to becoming confident and empowered about diabetes management
4207819 we received over 10 000 requests last year for the 7 habits of highly effective people r with diabetes booklet indicating the strong demand for us to create additional resources

4207827 half of the teenagers were saying they were out on school nights but only 14 percent of the parents knew that they were out
4207828 there are lots of factors at play here parents are not paying attention there are parents who are out in the evening themselves there are parents out at work
4207829 prescription drugs are entrenched and they have not moved for five years and this generation of parents simply do not understand the problem
4207830 kids think that because these are medicines that are prescribed they are safe
4207831 the problem is that there is very little difference between the amount they take for a high and the amount that causes an overdose
4207832 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4207833 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4207834 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4207835 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region
4207836 i think he can still give a lot to the national team

4207842 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4207843 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life

4207854 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4207855 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4207856 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4207857 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4207858 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4207859 ce rapport est perturbant parce que la hausse des prix nest pas limit e l nergie

4207865 the world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender there are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind there are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined we have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith we have enough greed we need more goodness we have enough vanity we need more virtue we have enough popularity we need more purity
4207866 we dig all the same things and get ridiculously excited about whatever were working on we also throw fits whenever were told no by the man and sometimes to our detriment have a burned earth policy when it comes to doing a project the way we want fortunately we usually get the support needed to build our visions and madman atomic comics is a prime example of that image comics could not be more supportive in their backing me up with all my crazed paper dreams in madman atomic comics theyre just as jazzed as i am to invite darwyn and mutual pal and cool genius j bone on madman atomic comics 14
4207867 i do thank you for your time it means a lot to me

4207918 it is unfortunate that many people business executives as well as so called security experts believe that the implementation of one or two security products can address security issues there cannot be a one size fits all approach to security as each environment is different with its own set of vulnerabilities and some security products themselves contain flaws which increase a networks vulnerability rather than reduce it
4207919 indeed if businesses are serious about security they need to understand that the only way to truly check that they are secure is to view the code thats one of the reasons i believe open source software is the better option for companies where security is of the utmost concern its not that open source is more secure but rather the fact that you can view the code see any vulnerabilities yourself and even fix if necessary if you have the skills to do so

4208134 we have regular discussions with the community about our solutions
4208135 fluendo is a company composed by people involved in the community and we always go hand in hand with the community it is normal that we dont always agree all together the patent situation in the multimedia field is very diffciult to understand and we have to satisify as many customers as we can whether they be end users from the community or big corporations
4208136 globally fluendo is welcome and considered as an open source friendly company
4208137 the majority of the 50 people in our company are developers full involved in the open source community
4208138 the community has always recognized that fluendo as very supportive even if selling non open source software
4208139 to help linux users to understand why some plugins are missing in their distribution and then we wanted to help them download solutions in the simplest way so codeina automatically pops up when you try to read a file and dont have a good codec then you can choose the solution you want
4208140 in addition to the philosophy which is present in our daily work as a company the top management has always believed that there are ways to conduct business based upon free software
4208141 this is the major link between fluendo and the open source community we are just part of it and we want to keep on being part of it we believe that open source solutions have a great future and we want to be be one of the players in this future

4208144 what is truly disturbing about the image of beyonce is that loreal has taken one of the most talented and beautiful black women in the world and in my view has deliberately lightened her colour and hair in order to sell a beauty product
4208145 this has to be the ultimate insult to every black woman out there beyonce included it is suggesting that in order to be beautiful and appealing she needs to be white

4208158 i think ann would be unhappy to have the source i e her translation listed as a translation by a woman because she wants it to be taken seriously on its own merits
4208159 i agree that we shouldnt qualify any translation work as by a woman though i find it ironic that many translation committees seem to be under pressure from some quarters to include a wide sample of minority voices including women and non white ethnicities its hugely ironic to me that on one hand we want a meritocracy that recognizes superior work as such regardless of who did it while on the other we want to give equal weighting to work from a diversity of backgrounds regardless of quality
4208160 it may seem presumptious for an ordinary woman with no particular advantages of education to translate and publish alone the most wonderful book that has ever appeared in the world and thought to be the most difficult to translate

4208181 if they want her all they have to do is go and get an order of immunity and then she has to testify
4208182 its very easy just give her immunity and shell testify
4208183 and my response to that was why do they have to contact the media to tell christine that she should come in
4208184 i said that months ago and half a dozen times to the media every time they raised it

4208190 creative work has a value whenever i use or take or build upon the creative work of others i am taking from them something of value whenever i take something of value from someone else i should have their permission the taking of something from someone else without permission is wrong it is a form of piracy
4208191 whatever the problem whatever the cause whatever the reason there is no place for violence in our society there is no issue that does not lend itself to dialogue and reconciliation
4208192 the paths of peace and compromise can be complex and difficult but pursue them we must they alone will enable the nation to grow and prosper i appeal that calm be always maintained in all parts of the country and wherever differences exist all efforts be directed towards reconciliation
4208193 with their disruptive agenda will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace from our region or from our commitment to forge co operative relations with other countries across the world
4208194 but empowerment of all sections of society still remains unaccomplished
4208195 our role in global political and economic affairs has been responsible and positive it is our view that multilateral institutions should be made more equitable and reflect contemporary realities
4208196 eco is interested in using the mathematical science of information theory to measure the relationship between the amount of information that the reader receives and the openness of a work

4208205 es zeigt lsp da der symbolisch verschl sselte transzendenzbezug der aus dem kanon christlicher zeichen und bilder spricht durch einen anderen bezug ersetzt wird aus der christlichen hingabe des lebens wird die hedonistische hingabe reiner leiblichkeit die sich in die sch nheitsversessenheit der gegenwartskultur vollkommen eingef gt hat
4208206 dieser denunziatorische atheismus ist von haus aus rassistisch weil er im wesentlichen besagt da alle menschen die religi s sind im grunde dumm unmoralisch oder armselige pers nlichkeiten sind
4208207 f r dawkins steht von vornherein fest da religion kein bleiberecht in der menschlichen kultur hat der glaube an gott repr sentiere ein infantiles stadium der glaube an gott sei nicht nur keine st tze eines wachen moralischen bewu tseins sondern sein glattes gegenteil die ursache f r die stilisierung und konservierung moralischer verbogen und verkommenheit seelischer verk mmerung und verkr mmung nicht atheisten sondern theisten sind wenn nicht moralisch verkommen so doch auf jeden fall geistig und seelisch zur ckgeblieben infantil oder sogar dumm

4208411 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4208412 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4208413 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

4208543 nhl teams unlike in other sports need more than two or three heavy lifters to build a successful team rather than have two 9 million snipers it makes sense for instance to sign two 6 million scorers deals still in the 96th percentile and add in two 3 million defencemen
4208544 given that even your best forwards can only play about one third of a game depth matters in hockey the league may go to a more top heavy salary model in the future if its proven that thats what works but for the moment the middle class isnt going anywhere
4208545 a quick and dirty look at each teams cap figure
4208546 look for gm doug wilson to beg anyone in the league to take defenseman kyle mclaren and his 2 5 million cap hit
4208547 the ducks are limited in their options until they can get someone to take mathieu schneider off the books
4208548 at about 1 5 million over the cap the logical move if gm darryl sutter wanted to create a significant amount of wiggle room would be to move adrian aucoin whos only got one year left on his deal
4208549 the logical move is to get rid of goalie nikiolia khabibulin hes only got one year left on his deal anyway which is for 6 750 million at this point itd make sense for gm dale tallon to just give away the russian netminder for anything even a box of chocolates or a bag of pucks
4208550 the flyers need to shed at least 1 million in payroll the odd man out veteran mike knuble who is still on the books for two more years at a cap hit of 2 8 million at age 35
4208551 youd think gm dean lombardi would kill two birds with one stone by grabbing khabibulin schneider and either mclaren or aucoin or rhett warrener whos still on waivers to add experienced blueline depth
4208552 if we made any changes it would most likely be with our defense
4208553 but we are comfortable and happy with where theyre at right now i can tell you as a fact i havent called a single team about our defense
4208554 top candidates to be traded are forwards jussi jokinen michel ouellet and jason ward
4208555 koules said speculation ryan craig coming off a season of back and knee injuries also could be moved was unfounded
4208556 because of the language barrier its still difficult to communicate with other players but they are friendly guys but i havent spent much time with them yet so we havent had the time to get acquainted ill make more friendships pretty soon
4208557 before coming here i was a little worried about what you eat
4208558 it is different thats for sure i mean that its slightly different but i got used to it easily
4208559 in europe there are more opportunities to stand out and theres also better pay for example in europe dubowitz earns more than he earned in north america and its good to have new challenges
4208560 in the future in a few years the league will be comparable this season ive only seen a few games and theyre only in pre season games when the season starts then ill be able to draw some conclusions about how competitive this league would be with the nhl so lets talk about it in the middle of the season
4208561 they are very beautiful they all dress very tastefully everyday monday tuesday wednesday or weekends they always look elegant and almost always wearing dresses i dont want to say that the american dress ugly compared to the latvian girls but they dress up only on saturday evenings in america the girls wear jeans on weekdays
4208562 sign parrish and youre essentially exposing your stated vision to build around youth as a fraud grabbing a popular former player just because he s available and he might be able to score 25 goals again is just not how you do it if you are truly committed to a plan
4208563 just so you know thats supposed to be funny even though i am serious
4208564 they are a good team theyve shown that last season and theyve started the season brightly as well
4208565 s gennaro meglio e pel camma fatto o mazzo tanto pe lav
4208566 io so superstizioso la verit una il ferro di cavallo il mio portafortuna lo porto sempre in tasca ma senza pantalone sign senza volere lho messo nel guantone azz

4208569 our brothers needs become our own because they are taking the journey with us as we go to god without us they would lose their way without them we could never find our own

4208575 no it is not ok it is never ok to tease
4208576 i was not about to deny iris the pleasure of watching dr

4208578 bren remember when jake calls tell him i just left and that im at my sisters you know i hate to lie to him but he gets so worried for no reason i dont want to stress him at work when were only grabbing a few drinks
4208579 honey this is a friend its just a friend of mine i wouldve brought him in and told you but i didnt want you to think something was happening that was wrong
4208580 we do not have a time table other than for it to be open right now
4208581 any activities taking place pre close are driven by helio name would disappear wallace wouldnt provide specifics
4208582 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4208583 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4208584 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4208585 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4208586 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently

4208590 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
4208591 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
4208592 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently
4208593 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia the
4208594 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy
4208595 enemy force the lead american ship in these war games the uss theodore roosevelt cvn71 and its carrier strike group two ccsg 2 are now headed towards iran along with the uss ronald reagen cvn76 and its carrier strike group seven ccsg 7 coming from japan
4208596 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4208597 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4208598 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4208599 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4208600 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4208601 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one
4208602 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4208603 we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield
4208604 our key demand the presence of patriots has been accepted by the americans
4208605 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4208606 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4208607 im not caught up in how big or small i am
4208608 some people say theyre a skinny person trapped in a big girls body and ive never seen myself like that i just feel like i could get a little healthier so why not
4208609 i feel good i dont feel all bloated and tired after a meal
4208610 i havent had to sacrifice anything that i normally eat i just eat a little bit less of it
4208611 i think its really important they play with passion play with emotion and play with excitement
4208612 i think it adds something to your game and something to your team at the same time when youre playing that way it also builds a little more confidence guys play a little faster at that pace
4208613 i think that it comes from the knowledge of the game
4208614 when you study the game and you understand what your assignments are and youre not thinking about your assignment you understand the three or four things that the defense can do to you then you have an opportunity to play a little faster
4208615 you enjoy it youre having fun youre not thinking about what ifs when youre thinking about what ifs you play slower and you dont have as much fun because youre really unsure about what may happen and whats going on
4208616 and im not sure whats gone on in those meetings but hes done a really good job of leading guys if we have a problem he talks to them about it and theyve gotten better
4208617 the guys tend to flock to him they like being around him they like hanging out with him those are the guys that are lining up with you on every down so it carries over from off the field to on the field
4208618 you evaluate their leadership when theyre running with the second unit it can tell you what leadership qualities they have to get that second group going
4208619 you may see 5 and 34 33 and 34 33 and 5 were spinning backs in together on numerous occasions
4208620 the polarisation of wealth across the age groups and the significant increase in consumer debt levels spurred by a growing divide between house prices and household income levels has resulted in an increase in the number of australian households at risk of mortgage default
4208621 surprisingly despite the marked distribution in wealth to the baby boomers their collective appetite for leveraged finance remains undiminished with those in the 45 59 age group holding over a third of the nations debt
4208622 consequently many younger australians have been crowded out of the property market altogether and many more are now dependent on credit providers
4208623 created to celebrate the union of the art and urban bicycle cultures the rolling canvas art collective will highlight and encourage the use of bicycles as a means of artistic expression

4208627 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4208628 the report states that queensland has more level crossings than victoria yet queensland only had 50 people hospitalised from level crossing collisions in this five year period less than half the number in victoria
4208629 it must be noted too that investigations by the australian transport safety bureau found that in almost every level crossing collision driver error was the cause with the motorist failing to stop or give way
4208630 the government is taking action to improve safety at level crossings but all motorists need to do their bit
4208631 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home

4208634 the industry wants to be treated on the basis of a level playing field with other countries around the world
4208635 maybe you think obama can end the war and maybe he can one thing is certain though the war wont end without all of us demanding and forcing it
4208636 give us the skills needed to immediately make an impact both at the convention and back in our own communities
4208637 not a stocked item and will be ordered from the distributor when you place an order
4208638 but i think that having nancy pelosi speak is a mistake she is the symbol of the ineffective democrat led congress she is a reminder that democrats would prefer to allow millions of americans to have to choose between food and or work or paying their energy bills she is the voice of the democratic party that refused to even consider having a vote on domestic drilling effectively saying that democrats have no intention of being bi partisan if senator obama is elected
4208639 speaker pelosi has walled off any discussion of domestic drilling for oil she has refused to allow any votes on the subject and according to her most recent comments on larry king she will only consider possibly allowing a vote on domestic drilling if it also includes alternative energy incentives effectively that means that speaker pelosi wants alternative energy to get more money to earn more money for herself the higher the cost for oil the better her alternative energy stocks will do and the american public be damned
4208640 and the only real outcome of these actions by the clintons is weakening of senator obama possibly splitting the democratic party and causing obama to lose that would open the door to senator clinton claiming she could have won and paving the way for her run in 2012 that is unless she cant get the nomination at the dnc its so deceptive it can only be a clinton plan
4208641 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4208642 its only taken her a day to realize that 2143 is over 2118 and that she has lost only a day to recognize that using race and religion as negative attacks has not helped her that every woman in america will not flock to her just because of her gender that taking every position possible on issues like illegal immigrants getting drivers liscences or lying to the public with ireland and bosnia to name a few is not a means to gain votes

4208683 after qualifying and after riding my run i thought i was going to win it
4208684 im not trying to be like a mladin here or anything and complain about everything but when i heard the results i felt like i got royally shafted
4208685 i had a little crash in practice at the spot last night and had to replace the whole stator cover and that always messes with your head but that is no excuse
4208686 i just need to ride harder next time im happy with the results fourth isnt bad im still in the points chase
4208687 im going to train all month and ride my best
4208688 i came here drove 2 600 miles so i wanted to do well enough to pay for the trip

4208690 it is a timed event so you have to go fast everywhere you are not doing a stoppie
4208691 i do my stoppies as low as i can to keep my speed up and hit all my points
4208692 i was so disappointed with how i rode at nashville which was good because then i did what i always do
4208693 i get mad i go home and i ride every day for hours and hours in the 106 degree vegas heat so my expectation was to come here and do well
4208694 any time i make money im ecstatic but beating andy niles in circle challenge is something i thought i would never do

4208696 what was going through my head was that i wanted to win something i figured that would be my best chance to do it im surprised i pulled it off i was a little bit wobbly
4208697 i was disappointed in my freestyle run i wasnt mentally prepared for this weekend

4208706 i had just put a brand new tire on my bike it was the first time it had ever touched the pavement so i knew i had some rubber back there so i just hoped i wouldnt get in trouble and went for it

4208718 quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in thenext little while as to whether or not this parliament canfunction productively
4208719 two of the three opposition parties dont support thegovernment and say we should be defeated mr dion says hedoesnt support the government but wont say you know whetherhe will defeat us or not
4208720 we were pretty ticked off too we were expecting more we were disappointed the way we played but again we have a lot of confidence that what scott implemented in the offseason was carried over to training camp
4208721 we still feel like we have the makings of a good team it wasnt a good start we have a long way to go before the opener and we feel like well get there
4208722 if it wasnt for that we would have had a hell of a time a really good camp
4208723 weve gotten better as a team other than that one glitch that one day were not going to let that negate all the good work we accomplished up here
4208724 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4208725 im going to play with a chip on my shoulder
4208726 you get angry when youve been at the top of your game when youre rated the no 1 fullback and then free agency comes and i kind of felt like rudolph the red nosed reindeer because of my age i got left out of the game
4208727 teams discriminate against you because of your age that was the toughest part of sitting out knowing youre still in great shape knowing you can still run knowing youre still ready to compete
4208728 anytime a guy does that and says that thats integrity
4208729 i could run around and try to get into a bidding war but you should stand up for whats right and do what you believe
4208730 the thing about him is that the players all know him

4208737 para culminar la aprobaci n de un solo plan territorial de ordenaci n del casi centenar que tiene pendientes
4208738 de los planes pendientes cuya elaboraci n corresponde al cabildo ninguno ha culminado el proceso de aprobaci n provisional en lo que va de mandato si no se culmina este tr mite el gobierno de canarias no puede proceder a su revisi n y aprobaci n definitiva
4208739 en el caso del gobierno de espa a se est n tomando importantes medidas en lo poco que les compete en estos asuntos y que es la agilizaci n de las declaraciones de impacto ambiental

4208741 entiende que una importante medida contra la desaceleraci n econ mica es la potenciaci n de la obra p blica la cual no puede quedar frenada por lentas tramitaciones administrativas
4208742 donde ocurre todo lo contrario pues no s lo no son capaces de sacar adelante planes territoriales de ordenaci n sino que ni siquiera ponen en funcionamiento una gerencia insular del territorio incluida en el programa electoral de cc en 2003 y anunciada en noviembre de 2005 para entrar en funcionamiento en tres meses
4208743 comprometer algo a cc y pp para que mejore la situaci n

4208754 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4208755 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4208756 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4208757 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4208758 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4208767 fashionable trends of thoughts and ideas are fastidiously separated from those that are not fashionable

4208769 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities the letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relations there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity paralyzing mans noblest impulses and it will be simply impossible to stand through the trials of this threatening century with only the support of a legalistic structure

4208771 i have a half dozen representatives down there on the job

4208773 a very unique job it is a huge dismantling job not like what everyday ironworkers do which is put up buildings there are a lot of unique factors and it is quite an engineering feat
4208774 the best way to show our gratitude towards and our appreciation for their help is to pay them back the sooner the better
4208775 to us little saigon is not only a cultural and commercial center of the citys vietnamese american community but more important it serves as a reminder of our roots and why we are here
4208776 we wanted to be more strategic and intentional in what we did and how we impacted the asian community
4208777 naaap has given me more confidence to step forward and take on responsibility more contacts and an awareness of history and the special circumstance of asian americans in general

4208780 you have a system thats supposed to strengthen airport security but you dont use the results of the tests to do exactly what youre doing the tests for
4208781 certainly we have used what weve learned over the years to improve security
4208782 we believe you can develop the resource while protecting the environment
4208783 because sustainable was an ambiguous term and because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oilsands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading
4208784 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
4208785 which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
4208786 each points up the fragility of the peace process each serves as a cautionary reminder of the potential consequences for sudan and its people should the peace process unravel or derail

4208789 our key demand the presence of patriots has been accepted by the americans
4208790 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles

4208792 we have reached a deal with the united states on the shield
4208793 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4208794 i think that presidents deserve to be questioned maybe irreverently most of the time to bring em down a size
4208795 access to a president doesnt mean youre gonna get the truth
4208796 i could see president kennedy was struggling so finally i got up and said thank you mr president i got him off the hook
4208797 we all have so much fun together im so lucky
4208798 my dad and ashton get along its not weird theres no jealousy or drama

4208802 memph bleek can suck my dick beanie sigel can suck my dick jay z can suck my dick roc a fella can suck my dick
4208803 im too disrespectful for jay z i go to hard his beef is mediocre beef its more swag and less hardcore me i go in on your grandma your kids and your girl it will get ugly and i dont mind i have a whole coast to back me my coast will turn their backs on whoever i turn my back on so basically let me commit suicide because im the only cat to commit suicide and resurrect every time so for jay to say that about me thats cool man because hes jay z and im just lil ol game but if you fuck with me ill turn to a beast and ill rip ya head off bust ya lips
4208804 i can be a fan of jay and still rip him limb from limb lyrically and still be a fan after i finish him off im still going to listen to reasonable doubt afterwards ill kiss jay goodbye with his own lips im going to make him mad enough to where he has to say something jay imma make you so mad you gonna have to diss me laughs i need him to do it i got an album coming out help me
4208805 the prospect of partying till early in the morning without disturbing any of the other camping guests seemed quite funny to us
4208806 my landlord has told me to vacate the house because i indicated to him that there was no way i could raise the foreign currency to buy the fuel coupons houses to rent are difficult to get these days and that means that my four children wife and i might end up living in the open if we fail to secure alternative lodgings
4208807 as it is i am struggling to keep the children in school we barely have enough food and i need to settle a huge bill after my wife stayed for two weeks in hospital where she was operated on for breast cancer god knows where on earth i would raise that kind of money
4208808 we have seen many property owners arrested for charging rent in foreign currency but there is no law that i am aware of that stipulates that a landlord cannot ask for fuel coupons so that way we are able to dodge the law while at the same time getting our rent in a form that enables us to keep our money stable
4208809 because that would leave me with the burden of having to go out onto the streets to sell it again
4208810 fuel coupons are now firmly a form of currency in a country whose people will stop at nothing to ensure that they are protected against a hyperinflationary environment
4208811 like foreign currency the value of the coupons does not change even if kept for a long time and that way service providers realise that they are able keep their money in a stable form
4208812 in other words coupons are a replacement for foreign currency and insistence on their usage by those who offer services or sell products amply indicates the level to which our economy has dollarised

4208815 a plane is standing on runway that can move some sort of band conveyer the plane moves in one direction while the conveyer moves in the opposite direction this conveyer has a control system that tracks the plane speed and tunes the speed of the conveyer to be exactly the same but in opposite direction can the plane take off

4208831 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
4208832 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

4208880 in april i approached him in good faith about having a series of debates after the primary and indeed to try some campaigning together for the good of the district and he agreed in fact we spoke this morning i called to congratulate him and reiterate my desire for at least seven debates he never mentioned a challenge he simply said hed be happy to

4208901 to be honest im not very well acquainted with the russian championship of course before the match they told me what the rivalry between these two clubs means and so i understood that we had to win today
4208902 one of the teams was just a lot stronger than the other
4208903 i think we got to a good start there must not be despair and hair tearing we do not always immediately begin to win medals for example the first gold medal in sydney we won on the fifth day and in athens on the third or fourth
4208904 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
4208905 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive

4208941 the club has to be able to support itself as soon as possible in the second season in the bundesliga the cash flow has to be positive
4208942 people think that i put money into the club as i please but that is not so our goal for this season is to finish between eighth and 14th
4208943 such a player would not fit into our team a player that makes 3 million euros 4 47 million and 5 million euros 7 45 million would break our limits it would demotivate the rest of the team but i hope that we will produce a superstar from our own ranks
4208944 we dont want to build players for other clubs we want to use our potential ourselves
4208945 we are going to continue with our very young players the team justified our confidence last season and really has significantly developed

4208955 move immediately to designate a new host city for the 2014 winter olympic games
4208956 the failure of the government of the russian federation to respect the sovereignty and territorial borders of its neighbors has rendered the country an unacceptable host for the 2014 winter olympic games
4208957 they are announcing it today in order to draw attention to it over the next few weeks
4208958 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles 32 kilometers from a zone of conflict particularly when the host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
4208959 the international olympic committee would not have selected sochi as the host city for the 2014 winter olympic games if its members had anticipated that the russian federation would invade the republic of georgia

4208988 as customers try new and increasingly complex wireless phone services and products such as playing mp3 files capturing still pictures or video or downloading ring tones they are more likely to call their provider for support
4208989 customer care centers and service representatives are under pressure to handle the increase in inquiries while still trying to understand and resolve the customers issue on the initial contact this can potentially increase the number of transfers and the hold times for customers with an increase in hold times providers run the risk of decreasing customer satisfaction and losing customers to other providers as switching levels are 83 percent higher among customers who are put on hold compared with those who are not
4208990 the fact that verizon wireless performs well in resolving issues with one contact is particularly noteworthy
4208991 overall customer care performance is three times higher among customers whose issues were resolved in one contact over the phone compared with those who had to contact their provider more than once for the same issue

4209033 im still getting to know senator obama its very difficult for me in two weeks or less than that to switch my support and be 100 behind somebody i would like to go to the convention and listen to barack obama
4209034 the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4209035 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4209036 first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4209037 he thanked me for supporting my country over my party
4209038 saya tidak tahu apa rencana taufik setelah memutuskan untuk mengundurkan diri sepulang olimpiade beijing tapi saya berharap agar taufik tidak meningalkan dunia bulutangkis dan bersedia membantu membina perkembangan bulutangkis sebagai pembina atau motivator bagi adik adik juniornya
4209039 saya melihat taufik tidak berbakat menjadi pelatih kalau dia ingin tetap menekuni bulutangkis mungkin yang cocok untuknya adalah sebagai motivator dengan mengadakan berbagai program pelatihan untuk atlet atlet muda
4209040 dari segi prestasi saya kira sudah cukup bagi taufik dan sekarang bagaimana ia menjalani hidup untuk menatap masa depan
4209041 dari awal saya sudah menekankan bahwa kondisinya tidak memungkinkan untuk tampil maksimal karena butuh waktu lama untuk benar benar pulih dari serangan deman berdarah hanya tekad kuat yang membuatnya berusaha tampil untuk memberikan yang terbaik bagi negara untuk terakhir kali di ajang olimpiade
4209042 mereka pemain thailand pada game kedua menunjukkan permainan cepat sehingga kami sempat kewalahan namun beruntung kita selalu siap sehingga tidak terpaksa harus rubber game
4209043 kami hanya mengandalkan strategi saja sehingga bisa meraih kemenangan kami juga berharap akan terus bisa bermain baik pada babak babak berikutnya
4209044 saya yakin akan lebih banyak menimbulkan mudarat dampak negatif red daripada manfaatnya kalau masalah merokok itu disikapi mui dengan mengeluarkan fatwa
4209045 bisa dibayangkan berapa ratus ribu orang akan kehilangan pekerjaan belum lagi pada lapisan masyarakat lainnya seperti pedagang rokok dan petani tembakau yang akan kena dampaknya
4209046 akan sangat bagus kalau disampaikan dalam bentuk imbauan melalui media massa mui bisa bekerja sama dengan praktisi periklanan bagaimana pesan tersebut bisa efektif diterima masyarakat
4209047 saya yakin tidak akan efektif buktinya sampai sekarang orang merokok masih banyak padahal di mana mana ada peringatan larangan merokok
4209048 rokok sudah menyumbang cukai rp9 miliar per hari kepada negara ini kan sisi positifnya rokok
4209049 agama islam tidak mengharamkan rokok oleh karena itu tidak perlu mui melarangnya dengan dalam bentuk fatwa
4209050 mana mungkin kami melarang lha wong kiainya saja pemabuk rokok biarkan saja mereka merokok asal jangan keterlaluan karena bisa menimbulkan pemborosan
4209051 kami berharap mui nantinya berbiacara dulu dengan kalangan perusahaan rokok

4209063 there is now a firefox browser that is 80 percent luganda but the local community with help from cit needs to continue to work on it to do some improvements before it is disseminated
4209064 we have got the skills and are now in a position to be able to translate firefox and other software into other indigenous languages
4209065 and we will do this because we want to contribute to narrowing the so called digital divide
4209066 we want to find out whether theres a role for messaging in the browser
4209067 the initial prototype is a primitive implementation with many bugs and subsequent versions will include changes that break functionality and delete all your messages making you start over from scratch
4209068 extensions are a great way to prototype functionality in firefox
4209069 but i want to stress that this is a labs experiment and doesnt mean were adding this in firefox
4209070 the reason why were conducting this experiment with snowl is because we dont know if messaging should be in the browser but we want to find out that and a lot of other things
4209071 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this
4209072 sounds like a polite way of saying nothing a verbal silence
4209073 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4209074 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4209075 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking

4209084 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4209085 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion said senator barack obama
4209086 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4209087 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again said senator hillary clinton

4209090 anything i can do to help my sport i am willing to do it its definitely a sacrifice but ive been able to handle it
4209091 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4209092 itll be very limited i want to make sure and im not quite certain yet but we should have answers very shortly
4209093 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4209094 every game i watch theres a bat splintered im sensitive about it and we need to move ahead
4209095 i thought we had forever solved the problem and we had everything we did worked but we may put an additional safeguard in
4209096 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4209097 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life
4209098 my comment to him was if dara can do it we can do it
4209099 im not going to win any medals for what i am doing
4209100 the sex and the city people are fun but its important to remember that its entertainment
4209101 ill take samanthas kim cattralls character body any day she looks fantastic but at the end of the day she doesnt inspire me
4209102 many people consider those celebrities completely separated from the world in which they live
4209103 there are times when i feel 40 and i feel like theres a piano on my back and i cant lift my arms up out of the pool and there are times when i feel like im 20 and just flying through the water
4209104 shes inspiring but shes not going to keep me going
4209105 it has to be my own decision and own choice its easy when you have a lot going on to make excuses it comes down to your own personal dedication
4209106 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4209107 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4209108 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4209109 oh hey guys our rules yeah there are no set consequences for breaking them
4209110 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4209111 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4209112 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4209113 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not
4209114 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4209115 its what i call a tough policy thats not smart
4209116 for i will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sin no more
4209117 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4209118 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4209119 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4209120 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region
4209121 i think following the olympics there will be a crackdown in xinjiang like never before
4209122 if you want to enjoy life fill yourself with good thoughts
4209123 loredana si pu sapere che succede dobbiamo provare tra pochi giorni c lo spettacolo
4209124 lo so benissimo caro led ma non credo che andrete in scena
4209125 ah cio a te sembra normale che una compagnia teatrale sia composto da soli uomini che in uno spettacolo non ci sia neanche una ragazza siete dei maschilisti
4209126 lored ma quali maschilisti le iscrizioni erano aperte a tutti son le ragazze a non essersi presentate
4209127 non vero sei tu che non le hai volute per portare in scena i tuoi filosofi finocchi umiliandoci ancora di pi perch con il tuo spettacolo fai sottintendere che le donne non sanno pensare e che la filosofia un affare per soli uomini
4209128 falso e poi non colpa mia se nella filosofia antica e nel testo di diogene non ci sono donne
4209129 ti rendi conto che una cosa impossibile di donne ce ne saranno state certamente sei tu che hai fatto opera di censura o trovi un personaggio femminile e lo interpreto io o ti blocco lo show

4209135 prior living situations and activities that may be considered prior bad acts
4209136 trigger unconscious racial bias simply due to a lack of understanding and exposure to inner city black communities
4209137 i had to be sure that i had somebody i could win with
4209138 i was proud of my crime it was the crime of joining my people in a nonviolent protest against injustice
4209139 last i heard they were starting to write it and they were thinking about setting it in the eighties
4209140 but i know when we were shooting it director adam mckay said if they ever did something it would have to be really weird like we were on the moon or something i think it has to go even further if it was to work
4209141 and we always try to think about what we can do next
4209142 since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false opinions in league with false facts the press confined to truth needs no other legal restraint the public judgment will correct false reasonings and opinions on a full hearing of all parties and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness if there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public opinion
4209143 all you have to do is a single definition of what your data looks like in a very simple way and then we can expose that to the rest of the world through multiple formats

4209146 the addition of the downtown newhall library will serve to shape the future of old town newhall as well as the future of our local youth who should benefit greatly from the access they will have to a modern and innovative facility
4209147 we have worked very hard to pull all kids up to higher achievement levels and these test scores show that what we have been doing is working the star test is just one way of helping us to measure our progress and the results tell us were on the right track
4209148 based on the outstanding results from our star tests i think we will do very well in both api and ayp
4209149 the subgroups are doing very well that is the power of no child left behind and we have done that very well the numbers support that
4209150 this means that 298 high performing seventh grade mathematics students took the algebra i cst instead of the seventh grade mathematics cst
4209151 these students performed very well on the algebra i cst with 96 percent of them achieving scores of proficient or advanced
4209152 last year 4871 seventh through 11th grade hart district students completed a course in algebra and took the algebra cst
4209153 this is an increase of 704 students or 17 percent from the previous school year the percent of these students scoring proficient or above improved from 41 percent in 2007 to 44 percent this year
4209154 each year ymca y guides participants host an annual community campfire which is attended by ymca families and members of the community
4209155 the 2008 community campfire will consist of traditional campfire songs skits and family building activities
4209156 this will also provide a good opportunity to those who would like to learn more about the y guides and how their k 8 children can become involved with all of the exciting character building activities throughout the year
4209157 as this event is taking place in the park please bring your own blanket or lawn chairs to enjoy
4209158 they have taken our passports this is a reflection of their insincerity they want to talk to us yet they behave like hooligans
4209159 all this crisis in kashmir has played into the hands of the separatists
4209160 it is all a huge setback for a political solution to kashmir we are back to where we were many years ago
4209161 one lesson is that the indian government cannot just allow kashmir to drift along there has been a level of simmering resentment that the government has been unwilling to deal with
4209162 the most worrying issue is kashmir seems to be returning to be a point of tension with pakistan
4209163 the peace process was for years seen through the eyes of pakistan and india kashmir was confined to being an ornament there is increased relevance being given to kashmiris
4209164 indias claim to legitimacy in kashmir rests on the holding of free and fair elections the last election had more than 40 percent participation what happens if a separatist boycott leads to 7 8 percent participation
4209165 the two presidents agreed on the resumption of the work of the joint committee to define and draw the syrian lebanese borders
4209166 the definition of the shebaa farms cannot happen under occupation
4209167 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
4209168 that was never my goal i was just focused on doing my best in beijing
4209169 i cant believe it i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
4209170 i didnt panic when i looked at the board i thought wow i did it
4209171 i guess its going to be me and ryan in the middle tomorrow its fine its all i wanted to do
4209172 what is important is to show china and to show beijing to the whole world
4209173 several months ago everyone was talking about tibet but foreigners need to know the truth about china and we believe that through the olympic games the world will know the truth
4209174 a few of us felt like we needed this game to show we mean business and are serious about the gold medal
4209175 im all for winning by as much as we can
4209176 but dont confuse our margin of victory with an easy win
4209177 it was one of the goals of the season for me to do well here
4209178 i wish i could have done much more but ive still got to look forward
4209179 this doesnt by any means mean im better than him because i beat him one out of 10 times or whatever blake said
4209180 but i was finally able to come up big on those important points i think this being considered a bad year for roger is just proof that hes been the best in the world for so long that we expect great things from him every single time he steps on the court
4209181 ive been unbelievably impressed at how hes handled that for four straight years that every time he goes on the court hes battling history
4209182 it turned when i didnt do what i needed to do williams said
4209183 just didnt work out i had chances to go up 41 or 31 i dont know and i ruined it for myself pretty much i was cruising theres no reason i should have lost
4209184 she played the match of her life and there wasnt much i could have done venus williams said
4209185 i lost my rhythm it happens shes had some nice results in her career but nothing like this especially against a player like me it was definitely a surprise result for me
4209186 at the beginning i was a little afraid of her service but i told myself i shouldnt care so much and then i got better and better
4209187 i believe that is a definite risk for dion right now
4209188 especially in this weakening economy people need to know and hear that theres some plan for the economy

4209217 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4209218 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4209219 i understand how everybody deserves a second chance and all but im not willing to risk my children and my neighbors to find out if theyre rehabilitated or not

4209258 the first thing courtney said to me was will you read my short i happily did
4209259 then i called her and said lets do this we shot the short she edited it showed it to me and said good job then she said would you like to do the feature i didnt even know she had a feature
4209260 there were unanswered questions in the short we didnt even know the characters at that time were the native and the blonde they had no names
4209261 courtney gave me a valuable piece of direction right before we shot the feature
4209262 watch the searchers 1956 and rio grande 1950 watch john wayne thats probably the most consistent piece of direction throughout the rest of the filming process its a little bit of the duke
4209263 the natives have a lot of female tribal heads you see the portrayal of the tribal meetings in the film to be heavily female which is an accurate portrayal of those types of meetings
4209264 in our film this is women doing what women do to get by especially when the men have let them down
4209265 the strength of the film is the story a story that most people havent heard before
4209266 its a rich story because it encompasses all those themes
4209267 the two women have learned something have grown and are better people by the end of the film because of the journey the audience watches them go through
4209268 we are here to grow into our best selves that is my religion whatever can get you there and whatever the trials that is what betters us that is how the story of this film is played out

4209282 the reality is that in the near term the economic leverage anyone has over russia is limited
4209283 those two countries arent going to be eager to give ground to the russians anytime soon and the russians arent going to ask
4209284 the first priority is to secure a lasting cease fire
4209285 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds
4209286 because of energy the eu knows it wouldnt come out on top if it imposed trade sanctions on russia
4209287 they might be willing and interested in pushing the russian government to try to get back in more of a cooperative mode of working with the u s and european countries
4209288 in the long term for russia to think it can continue to prosper without access to capital and technology available in international markets is simply delusional

4209297 microorganisms that pose a high risk of life threatening disease and for which there is no known vaccine or therapy
4209298 i will fight this proposed plum island expansion involving insidious and deadly diseases that have no known cures nearly eight miles off connecticuts shore in the midst of environmentally precious and highly populated areas
4209299 this vastly heightened risk level poses unacceptable costs and dangers
4209300 connecticut has close and personal experience with pernicious diseases transmitted by animals to humans such as anthrax and lyme all the more reason to challenge this proposed vast expansion
4209301 both sides of the sound should join forces as we did with broadwater in fighting this environmental and security threat our next step will be to file formal comments on the draft environmental impact statement urging that it be sited elsewhere

4209304 the opposition is not afraid of losing against gma in 2010 if the constitution were amended and she could run again
4209305 if the administration is really brave then let them make a strong push to amend the charter specifically to allow gma to run again and let us see if the people will support gma or reject her like before
4209306 in a fair election the people will reject her like they rejected her peoples initiative and like they rejected her candidates for the 2007 senatorial elections
4209307 the oppositions stand on charter change has been consistent and in fact was part of the genuine oppositions platform in the 2007 elections we will oppose any move to amend the constitution at this time whether by constituent assembly peoples initiative or constitutional convention
4209308 not only will it be a waste of billions of pesos that could be used for social services in these economically difficult times but also its real objective is to enable gma to stay in power beyond 2010 lets wait till we have a new administration with a fresh mandate and then we can start broad consultations on the wisdom of changing the charter
4209309 if the constituent assembly has been convened it has plenary powers i dont think you can limit by law what the constituent assembly can take up
4209310 will really open all other amendments that may be considered
4209311 it becomes a plenary group tuloy tuloy na yan you cant say lets just change this
4209312 meron tayong proposed resolution ibig sabihin niyan sisimulan ang diskusyon nagugulat nga ako dahil iyong iba ang akala ay tapos na ang resolution sa senado ang proseso dito sa senado ay matagal pa
4209313 itong proposal na inihain ni sen pimentel na pinirmahan naman ng mahigit 12 na mga senador ay para talakayin ang isyu ng federal system of government mahaba pa iyan
4209314 kapag hindi umusad siguro ayaw ng tao ang pederalismo kaya dapat ang tao ang sisihin niya pero ipapakita namin kay secretary dureza kung paano siguro mag hearing ito ay magiging iba dahil lahat ng tao ay makakaalam transparent talaga

4209318 one of the biggest impressions on me is elvis presley he wore rockmount shirts

4209321 but i have to say if it had been lens who did something like this we would have been guillotined
4209322 some clubs are privileged in relation to others in this affair it would have been better for psg to roll over and accept the decision
4209323 happy that the judge had taken into account the work the club had done before and during the game to prevent all incidents of this nature in a match which wasnt organised by the club
4209324 we can say that human activities really screwed up oxygen conditions in our coastal areas
4209325 the next big challenge after global warming is going to be addressing the massive upset of the worlds nitrogen cycle
4209326 its not happening for me it came to a moment where you have to decide and move forward
4209327 i really felt like i needed to take a break and not do the film now

4209330 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges
4209331 the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
4209332 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases

4209339 i love paula we have worked together and been friends for over 25 years
4209340 i support her in anything she does paula is an incredibly smart and talented producer and i look forward to working together producing films in the future
4209341 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4209342 as much as ive enjoyed my time as an executive i have longed to return to my true love which is making movies so thats what ive decided to do
4209343 i still believe in our vision for ua and i am confident that mgm ceo harry sloan and our colleagues at mgm will see that vision through to reality
4209344 this was very hard for tom everyone recognized that paula has been a disaster but to his credit he wanted her to have an exit with honor
4209345 as part of the reinstatement review he was given an opportunity to submit any relevant information he would like to provide he was asked to do that by this friday if he chose to do so

4209349 were going to start talking to modeling agencies about the possibility of exclusive representation
4209350 right now we really wanted to focus on companies that i think have a long term perspective of how to utilize cullen

4209369 the ability to provide total visibility metrics and data sharing between dynatrace and the lisa soa testing framework offers the defense it community a way to ensure the highest service levels of their critical applications
4209370 the ability to cause the cause within the application being monitored and share data in the same context literally ties together the effects being viewed with the root cause as generated by the lisa testing environment
4209371 with the complexity of soa based systems our customers demand real time root cause analysis across tiers
4209372 we can have lisa model the end to end workflows drive user behaviors and provide failure reporting at the component level dynatrace integration enables users to pinpoint the root cause of problems in synthetic transactions down to the code whether java net or a hybrid of both and supply rich real time data for collection into the reporting framework

4209400 i am a job seeker hey thats a much cooler title than being the unemployed person right how does that feel i am committed to finding an employer who would value my talents in x y and z id love your ideas about companies that might fit that bill
4209401 if you want to hang on to that energy be my guest but if youd like to shift that energy sooner rather than later dont wait for an employer to change the picture decide to lighten up on yourself and call yourself something else

4209410 results determine a lot of things so im not too concerned i think we have to be judged on what we do and judged on where we are at and how we attack things
4209411 we think our acquisitions of robbie russell and clint mathis in this transfer window add veteran depth in defense and attack to what has been a successful core group of players
4209412 we expect clint to be able to step up in a plethora of roles and contribute clint chose rsl over several other offers and really wanted to come back to salt lake we have embraced his return with open arms

4209423 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4209424 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4209436 this time im speaking about cars but im speaking about them in a whole different fashion i start the song off by saying i took her off the floor no money down im talking about a female but im comparing her to a car im not talking about how much my rims cost my soft leather seats the tvs in the headrest and all these things that really have no value or meaning to me
4209437 i never focus on what people are listening to or what other guys are doing
4209438 since day one its always been about lyrics so i never go into the studio with the idea of making a club song or a radio song or something that females will like it just has to come naturally

4209444 pada kali ini tanggapan negatif terhadap pas telah dikikis apatah lagi terhadap muslimat kerana tidak pernah kita bermimpi calon muslimat kita menang di kawasan majoriti bukan islam
4209445 ujarnya semasa merasmikan muktamar dewan muslimat pas pusat ke 48 di hotel hillcity dekat sini hari ini
4209446 saya sendiri apabila ada demonstrasi pada mulanya berasa takut mahu ke bilik air kadang kadang berkali kali bagaimanapun apabila ke tempat demonstrasi
4209447 namun apabila saya lihat wajah wajah muslimat seperti ketua wanita parti keadilan rakyat zuraidah kamaruddin peguam latiefa koya dan setiausaha muslimat pas aiman athirah al jundi semangat saya terus datang mereka yang selalu menjaga saya katanya sambil disambut gelak ketawa para hadirin

4209450 there was a man who stood as the head of his house he did not allow those that were unclean in dress and of spirit to enter his house without a move to clean their outward body however after this was done he sought to render the inner cleanness of the truth of god
4209451 meanwhile there was a preacher man who headed a church he allowed all types of people of unclean nature to enter the house of god although the church is a hospital for the spiritual sick this preacher man did not acknowledge that many of these people were unclean and sick we saw him with a priority of gaining material money possessions and not a priority of saving souls
4209452 ye shall not make any cutting in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you i am the lord
4209453 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god also see 1 corinthians 11 9 11 beloved there is no supremacy of the man in this scripture
4209454 unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shall bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee
4209455 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body
4209456 ms rider has stated that the judicial system is one too flawed and too imperfect
4209457 its easy to open your wallet pay that money and walk out of court
4209458 i am a christian theologian and the subject of theology is god
4209459 catholic moral teaching is the longest tradition of church history since christians are a people who worship a person who died at the hands of the state that being capital punishment christianity s relationship to the state is at the heart of what catholic ethics is about christians are not allowed to give their ultimate loyalties to their state
4209460 the only people in the jury are those who believe firmly in the death penalty
4209461 it seems like youre stacking the cards against the defendant already
4209462 i am choosing to suffer for my faith and fidelity to jesus
4209463 spending time in jail for me would be an honor rather than a deterrent it would be a privilege to encourage others to do the same
4209464 youre lucky to have a wife like that and youre lucky to have a mother like that

4209471 you can t get taste if you don t have it
4209472 everything should be included in the system including aircraft carriers
4209473 starting with the fourth submarine we will begin modernizing this class the modernized borei submarines will be the core of russian naval nuclear forces until 2040
4209474 we are aspiring not only to introduce new technologies not only to compete with the west but to take completely new steps which would allow us to look at submarine technologies of the middle of the 21st century
4209475 russias other soviet designed submarines although still not a match for us submarines

4209477 what is truly disturbing about the image of beyonce is that loreal has taken one of the most talented and beautiful black women in the world and in my view has deliberately lightened her colour and hair in order to sell a beauty product

4209485 as so often the prince of waless views are in tune with public opinion
4209486 even the gung ho gm us department of agriculture accepts that currently available gm crops do not increase the yield potential only pr firms working for the gm industry claim otherwise 2
4209487 agribiz owned and patented gm seeds that only grow true for one season and which need large inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides will not deliver greater global food security they were not designed to meet the needs of poor farmers in developing countries but to maintain the profits of the vast multinational companies who make both the gm seeds and the chemicals used on them prince charles previous pithy summary of gm crops as new uses for old herbicides was spot on
4209488 currently available gm crops do not increase the yield potential of a hybrid variety in fact yield may even decrease if the varieties used to carry the herbicide tolerant or insect resistant genes are not the highest yielding cultivars
4209489 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present
4209490 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
4209491 global political effort must be channelled into securing long lasting green farming solutions that put people not corporations at their heart and the uk government must look at the evidence before falling for gm industry hype
4209492 prince charless comments are a welcome contribution to the ongoing debate about gm crops around the world
4209493 the prince has also focused on the environmental impacts of gm crops especially on the soil

4209509 this is the most publicized issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of an embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4209510 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4209511 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4209512 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4209513 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4209514 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4209515 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4209516 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualization to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4209517 virtualization is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4209518 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualization movement virtualization is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this

4209558 expand customer choice by supporting routes that would not be economically viable for the individual airlines
4209559 the joint business agreement will enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on fares from record fuel costs
4209560 this means that the airlines will have greater ability to invest in their products services and fleets employees and shareholders will also benefit from the agreement
4209561 there is no reason why fares should rise if this agreement is approved
4209562 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers

4209640 unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven

4209655 the irony is that the little infants steal the weapons of mars they joke with him with the god of war and war is a tragedy
4209656 likewise an enema is an unpleasant procedure as many of us may know but when cherubs do it its all right
4209657 if their kvas is sold alongside coke it will improve its image among young people and raise the whole sector

4209659 oh jesus i hate that stuff especially out of the yellow bowsers do those things ever get cleaned btw
4209660 among others one russian guinness stout lover i know made that comment i got him hooked on the black and tan g stout with a quality sweet ale like harp or killians mixed in
4209661 in the early 1990s micro brew beer halls were a craze here in the colonies the take home micro brew often had a note on the bottle or keg to drink it within a limited time period
4209662 yet a number of foreign travellers who journey throughout russia arent up to snuff on this subject
4209663 that became trendy in the colonies as well quite a site to see the vodka taking the color out of the fruit on the bottom
4209664 by the way to give you an idea of how widespread these stores are now there are even two in my sleepy somerset hometown
4209665 off topic a bit but of no doubt interest to some http www russiatoday ru guests detail 1211
4209666 hopefully when russia hosts next years eurovision they will take a leaf from the ukrainians and allow visa free travel for european tourists for the summer
4209667 i also wonder why one of the ny yankees is further along the roof
4209668 unfortunately american espn shows champions league matches without showing any uefa ones
4209669 too bad about the fan violence in other instances it has been regretfully worse
4209670 the current major russian sports item can be found here
4209671 its quite a pleasure to ride one of those very near water level tour boats alongside that great city
4209672 among all of the major ice hockey playing euroepan countries i suspect that football soccer is the more popular sport
4209673 vis a vis football at the elite level russia has had greater succcess in ice hockey
4209674 the skill with which the russian boys whizz around the public ice rinks or rather a patch of ground deliberately frozen
4209675 in the us and canada theres a mix of wealthy middle class and lower middle class families willing to shell out the dough for such activity
4209676 what would i do id shut apple down and give the money back to the shareholders
4209677 enoch walked with god then he was no more because god took him away
4209678 as they elijah and elisha were walking along and talking together suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them and
4209679 about that time there arose a great disturbance about the way
4209680 hindi mo maiintindihan ang bible kung hindi mo babasahin ang mga pamphlets o magazines namin
4209681 and you see and hear how this fellow paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in ephesus and in practically the whole province of asia
4209682 there is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name but also that the temple of the great goddess artemis will be discredited and the goddess herself who is worshipped throughout the province of asia and the world will be robbed of her divine majesty
4209683 i warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book
4209684 for the lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command with the voice of the archangel and the trumpet call of god and the dead who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air homebodyhubby said
4209685 jesus replied and why do you break the command of god for the sake of your tradition you nullify the word of god for the sake of your tradition you hypocrites isaiah was right when he prophesied about you
4209686 you have let go of the commands of god and are holding on to the traditions of men you have a fine way of setting aside the commands of god in order to observe your own traditions you nullify the word of god by your tradition that you have handed down
4209687 see to it that no one takes you captive though hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on christ
4209688 for you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers but with the precious blood of christ a lamb without blemish or defect
4209689 i guess leading the nation in passing is not everything its cracked up to be
4209690 harrell is not a guy you say well hes just so weak at this
4209691 crabtrees got a little knack on a dig route and theyre on the same page on this if the situations right instead of coming all the way across hell return when he does that hes wide open i think as theyre wandering around playing video games doing whatever they do some of that is rolling though their head it brings out some positive things
4209692 not to feel like there is a next step just grow in the system naturally like he did a year ago if he can throw for 36 touchdowns again to only eight interceptions i think were going to have a really good year
4209693 i think one of the harder things to coach a young guy in is pocket presence to stay in the pocket
4209694 well he already has that i think at times he can leave it a little bit more some of that will naturally happen as he gets comfortable with it
4209695 we probably put too much on him in 2007 because we werent doing well
4209696 we were trying to find something we could do early we probably gave him too much stuff and there were tipped balls and unfortunate balls early
4209697 i have to play better than i did last year at the same time the experience that i gained from last year is so important i know how to play the game honestly i felt like i became a much better quarterback than what i was
4209698 knowing your offensive linemens strengths and matchups where in the pocket for each protection that you can step up into
4209699 he needs to just constantly work getting his reads and continue to get rid of the ball quickly
4209700 hes going to get a lot of looks theyre going to try to fool him he has to continue to be a good student of the game
4209701 i know never throw the ball late down the middle
4209702 hes a dynamic leader somebody who plays with a tremendous amount of confidence and that toughness about him
4209703 we are not in any imminent danger of filing for bankruptcy
4209704 thanks for this fake memo wikileaks what do you mean its not real
4209705 of course youre completely maxed out right now and i totally understand and i dont expect anything different
4209706 and i havent gotten to tell you a single thing about san francisco and i found out today that im not pregnant and i feel all kinds of things about that and i feel nauseated and fatigued for no good reason and i really wish i would do other things in my office besides be on the computer like write letters or sew
4209707 i really dont think you need to be this forceful with me
4209708 yes but i just said i dont this is me its not necessary
4209709 you need a hug okay maybe i need a hug
4209710 the bitch of it is that i really miss you
4209711 a lot of things can happen in four weeks when i come back hes going to be a totally different person
4209712 weve had no leadership in washington from either republicans or democrats on this issue
4209713 if you dont solve this problem then you dont have to talk about health care or education or national defense because youve got no money to pay for any of it
4209714 i want to use the wind and i want to use the sun i want to use everything american
4209715 i am for everything american and i am against foreign oil
4209716 boone pickens is a real person and hes never forgotten where he came from he knows he is an oklahoman
4209717 hes a man who has often been ahead of his time only to later be proved right
4209718 we imported 24 percent of our oil during the nixon administration and at the time nixon said wed be off foreign oil soon
4209719 every president since has said were going to get off foreign oil
4209720 one candidate said were going to have 1 million plug in hybrids on the roads youve got to get up to 100 million before you start doing any good
4209721 gm makes 19 natural gas vehicles but none in america how about that thats why theyre going broke
4209722 thats an expensive honda but i sold my mercedes for 70 000
4209723 private industry could do it in 10 but if the government does it itll take 20
4209724 ive made a lot of money in the past 30 years and ive talked to a lot of politicians now that ive made this money i can get in to see them faster but they still dont listen they will listen to the people
4209725 this 4 gasoline has really gotten a lot of peoples attention
4209726 i think ive struck a nerve here this is the plan and the plan will work
4209727 i am satisfied by the way we have solved the debt problem the deal will not only employ russian defence enterprises but will also help strengthen libyas defences
4209728 while they are deploying the missile shield in poland and the czech republic our strategic bombers will already be landing in cuba
4209729 if they did i think we should stand strong and indicate that is something that crosses a threshold crosses a red line for the united states of america
4209730 russia has enough resources to secure its presence in different parts of the world if russian armed forces would like to be present in venezuela they will be welcomed warmly
4209731 we will raise flags beat drums and sing songs because our allies will come with whom we have a common worldview
4209732 after much deliberation between the soviet union and kennedys cabinet kennedy agreed to remove all missiles set in turkey on the border of the soviet union in exchange for khrushchev removing all missiles in cuba
4209733 offhand and without checking as a condition for ending the cuban missile crisis i believe the american government secretly at the time agreed to remove american missiles from turkey at a later date from the soviet missile withrawal from cuba some see this as kennedy offering a kind of face saving gesture to khrushchev that is correct
4209734 the main reason besides a tough discipline is the fact that russians arent spoonfed the idea of being superior to their hosts and may misbehave however and whenever they feel like doing so and having the aspa and other acts to protect them heh you keep believing that matey
4209735 regarding the above conversation and putting aside military operations like 1953 56 and 68 its reasonable to believe that the red army had a shorter leash when it came to off duty interaction among the locals when compared to their american counterparts
4209736 i suspect is little more than the result of some pretty fraulein scorning a certain local in favour of an american soldier a decade and a half ago
4209737 diplomatically this was quite true the apartment complex for the soviet un and consular staff in riverdale ny saw little social meshing in the community now it houses rf un and consular staff folks there regularly go out and about in riverdale as well as other parts of ny
4209738 overall the poles in the few decades following ww ii hated the germans more than the soviets especially russians ukrainians and belarusians thereafter the mood swing changed
4209739 btw ive heard read my share of not so nice behavior on the part of the czechs towards the germans at the end of ww ii
4209740 just to make things a bit more confusing my wifes grandmother was a child during the 3 year german occupation of her village somewhere in belorussia
4209741 look at the state of you showing off your tits and arses is this what we fought for in the war so you can waltz around moscow dressed like slappers
4209742 it was still a better option than the nazi period in poland
4209743 i guess away from the main action it was all down to individuals in particular the decency of the commanding officer
4209744 when discussing ww ii i try to make it a point to say nazi or nazi german as opposed to just german
4209745 this leads to why i think russians and germans can bury the hatchet with each other
4209746 russia has enough resources to secure its presence in different parts
4209747 at least nine porsche cayenne vehicles two bmw 5 series two mercedes s class and eight lexus gx 470 or toyota 100 land cruiser
4209748 as president i have summoned law enforcement heads and asked them why the vostok battalion is commanded by badrudi yamadayev a man who should be in jail but instead is walking around armed to the teeth and committing further crimes
4209749 at least nine porsche cayenne vehicles two bmw 5 series two mercedes s class and eight lexus gx 470 or toyota 100 land cruiser
4209750 while a cause of concern practically its a bit jumping the gun to assert that things are about to get back to where they were during the dudayev and maskhadov periods
4209751 part of chechnyas inner problem seems to be that it doesnt have a single leader who the people on the whole look up to
4209752 my thoughts exactly dont forget the grand mosques palaces etc also on the plans im sure chechens are crying out desperately for these
4209753 so much for stability in chechnya then after twice levelling the place and then installing an animal as president what can one expect
4209754 as of now the situation remains more stable than the worse of the dudayev and maskhadov periods
4209755 at best maskhadov was unable to deal with the terrorist problem
4209756 post soviet russia hasnt made it a habit to level other republics
4209757 while not admitting it outside russia unfriendly agitators use chechnyas misfortune to score cheap propaganda points
4209758 robert bruce ware dmitry simes and nick petro are among the
4209759 maskhadov was essentaily approved by the kremlin as a better option over dudayev what does russia gain by carnage in chechnya
4209760 yeah it seems like others not saying anyone here are looking for the situation to spiral out of control as means of scoring cheap propaganda points
4209761 when maskhadov assumed the presidency russia was in dire straits hence aid was harder to come by
4209762 regardless of what some others say one wonders what theyre actually hoping for
4209763 petros views of russian media are more detailed than what you presented and i note how you havent challenged rbw
4209764 therere many examples showing a diversity of views in russian media hard hitting at that
4209765 i sense that chcehnya is probably going to have continued peaks and valleys and that the peace option will eventually prevail
4209766 regarding the earlier negatives stated about russian action in chechnya the beheading of western journalists implementing of sharia law and utilization of outside agitators like khattub arent something that should be glossed over
4209767 tim newman says april 30th 2008 at 7 24 am i suppose if one considers historical events with such childlike simplicity whereby judgement of a wars justification is simply a matter of numbers killed and nothing else then the us invasion of iraq belongs in a discussion criticising russias actions in chechnya
4209768 its also very disingenuous to piously rant on about russian committing mass murder in chechnya
4209769 once again dudayev and maskhadov didnt have full control over the situation to go along with their own faults
4209770 actually youre the childlike one here with your arrogant and ignorant portrayals of russian and serb actions versus how you spin those of countries youre more familiar with and sympathetic to
4209771 rational people dont put their life on the line when its not necessary
4209772 youve once again failed miservably in trying to slur what ive said
4209773 despite my fear of being accused of stifling debate i feel compelled to ask would you children all like a lollypop
4209774 youre carrying on like the dumb one for thinking there was no basis for chechen war i
4209775 never said russia has a freer media you constantly distort what ive said
4209776 american mass media has some serious issues which others besides myself have detailed with facts and fact based opinions
4209777 genocide inflation is the real human rights threat yugoslavia and rwanda
4209778 the claims of 8 000 executed at srebrenica in 1995 have never been verified by forensic or credible witness evidence of anything like this scale of killing
4209779 we effectively managed our business through diverse economic challenges particularly in the united states by building on the strength of our brand portfolio
4209780 saat segala hal berjalan dengan lancar di fase grup saya diberitahu oleh rekan rekan kalau saya harus mempertimbangkan kembali keputusan pensiun jika begitu keadaannya maka saya akan berlanjut

4209784 these results represent significant progress of a t cell engaging antibody for treatment of lymphoma patients as single agent therapy we observed tumor regression in patients at serum levels of blinatumomab which are approximately five orders of magnitude lower than serum levels needed by conventional monoclonal antibodies for achieving a tumor regression in this disease this may relate to the high anti tumor activity of cytotoxic t cells recruited by blinatumomab
4209785 this first observation of durable objective responses in relapsed incurable patients indicates the potential blinatumomab and bite antibodies in general may have in fighting cancer

4209790 has what it takes to become the stylist to the stars
4209791 fights to be herself in an industry that in the past wanted her to be something different
4209792 fans all over the world are eagerly anticipating the season opener of bundesliga one of europes top leagues with international stars like luca toni franck ribery and miroslav klose
4209793 only goltv delivers the best action from germany honoring our commitment to deliver unmatched international soccer coverage directly to fans in north america
4209794 one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4209795 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4209796 tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4209797 not do anything that would be disruptive to what has been very important to the republican platform
4209798 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney
4209799 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held and thats it
4209800 i have no expectations that im going to get that phone call
4209801 my commitment is to support him and i dont request that he support me in order to get my support

4209808 any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules
4209809 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4209810 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4209811 one step further for china to open up and i think its a very good gesture
4209812 in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights
4209813 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4209814 daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4209815 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of u s russian relations
4209816 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4209817 re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities with russia and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4209818 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4209819 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4209820 i am convinced that honoring senator clinton s historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4209821 with every voice heard and the democratic party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4209822 i think we will end up being just fine roll call or no roll call
4209823 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel their voices were heard and their views were respected

4209829 3 the resolution avoids skeptical shady strategies that people have lately been employing on topics that have been annoying a lot of people for instance the principle of taint of injustice is irrelevant to this topic as are skeptical arguments and arguments like anarchy good
4209830 resolved in the united states jury nullification is a legitimate check on the government
4209831 why does everyone dislike this topic resolved it is morally permissible to kill one innocent person to save the lives of more innocent people
4209832 there can be no primary metaphorization of our sexual difference so that we can represent ourselves reshape the meaning of feminine and transmit our significance to humanity between the generations

4209849 on april 20 a russian mig 29 fighter jet shot down an unarmed unmanned air vehicle which was performing basic reconnaissance over georgian territory its absolutely illegal for a russian mig 29 to be there
4209850 nonsense what would a russian jet fighter be doing over georgian territory
4209851 the mig 29 has a distinctive twin tail marking its a russian aircraft georgia does not possess it nor do abkhaz separatists
4209852 its a mig29 and we dont have any so it must be big bad russia
4209853 1 is this really footage from georgia 2 we only see a clip is there anything of interest earlier 3 im suprised that the mig took a frontal shot and wasted a missile
4209854 the flight by the reconnaissance plane was a violation of the moscow agreement on the ceasefire of may 14 1994 and of the corresponding resolutions by the un security council on the mandate of the un observer mission in georgia the foreign ministry added
4209855 georgia after first denying that it owned reconnaissance aircraft that could have flown sundays mission made a statement saying one of its unmanned aerial crafts was attacked while conducting routine surveillance above the breakaway georgian territory of abkhazia
4209856 civil georgia 22 04 2008 georgia has about 40 unmanned reconnaissance aerial vehicles uav president saakashvili told the new york times

4209943 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable
4209944 in recent days moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the georgian region of south ossetia
4209945 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
4209946 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
4209947 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u

4209954 georgia itself my friends has a long and remarkable history
4209955 and my friends and ill talk about this more in a minute but theyre at a strategic crossroads
4209956 the russian government stated it was acting only to protect ossetians and yet on saturday its bombing campaign encompassed the whole of georgia
4209957 before the weekend ended russian troops drove the georgians out of south ossetia and stepped up their offensive in the region of abkhazia abkhazia is another area that the russians have controlled in violation of georgian territorial integrity

4209985 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4209986 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4209987 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4209988 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4209989 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
