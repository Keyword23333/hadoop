6920024 this summer while running routes mike tweaked his knee and partially tore his left acl
6920025 his two options were to have the knee fixed immediately or to brace it and try to play he understood that eventually the knee would have to be fixed and he was hoping to do it at the conclusion of the 2008 season
6920026 mike had continued to practice but felt his progress had deteriorated thursday afternoon mike came to me and decided that having the surgery done now prior to the start of school would be best together with jim russ and our team doctors we quickly arranged surgery for late friday morning the surgery was successful and mike will spend the 2008 season rehabbing to be ready for the 2009 season

6920053 the wayne county airport authority is totally in support of the efforts of leader dogs for the blind to help our contractors and tenants airlines and ground transportation providers to be aware of the needs of the disabled
6920054 our hope is that we can train these companies so they can be aware of what they are doing
6920055 its not hard at all to provide service to a disabled passenger its just a matter of information
6920056 because it makes it easier for you to help them
6920057 basically you treat a person with a disability with respect and dignity as you would any other customer

6920064 ill leave it up to the coaches im a little slow on the playbook right now thats the only thing holding me back
6920065 it was not easy taking this step since politics like religion is something learned on the knee of ones parents and grandparents and like anything else inherited it is imbedded in ones own identity this makes leaving even harder but there will be some joy for me in my new status since i will be able to speak for myself and not as a member of a party that has sadly lost its way
6920066 so one person leaving the party is an indicator that the party has lost its way
6920067 already took it to the junk yard since they were junk
6920068 right now these players teams look like they are going to produce at an epic pace for the foreseeable future but for some reason i believe they may be one and done as far as their prolific contributions to the sport are concerned
6920069 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6920070 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6920071 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6920072 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6920073 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6920074 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6920075 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6920076 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6920077 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6920078 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6920079 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6920090 were still working towards it and it should be done shortly
6920091 were not set to go anywhere were still working hard on it
6920092 ive been here for five years and obviously were not running where we should be that goes for all of us whether it be chip ganassi juan pablo montoya or me or the crew chiefs
6920093 everybody is kind of discouraged on how we are running were testing every week just trying to get it better we seem to be struggling trying to do that
6920094 ive got a lot of time built into this company it means a lot to me target means a lot to me i like everything its just weve got to figure out how to run better
6920095 if nascar comes back and says its till the end of the year well add to that
6920096 if they come back and say its eight races then well go to the end of the year
6920097 we were right where we needed to be i dont know what else to say it was handling really good its been handling really good all day so hopefully we can keep it up there all night
6920098 the last few days weve had people indicating that maybe these guys were railroaded
6920099 i just want to make the point that this was not one isolated incident but really was a series of issues when you have two violations within a matter of months it would appear that something is seriously amiss
6920100 you turn around and take an airplane ticket and perform on a porn site for money and it was pretty automatic at that point that we couldnt go forward

6920104 it is definitely a privilege not a right that an athlete be allowed to play at nebraska
6920105 we intend to try to create the exact same feel as we always have
6920106 we have a very good idea of what they do and their personnel
6920107 i can learn a lot from their program as you look at their record the past two years and even before but they were 12 1 last year and i think theyve lost only one game in the past two years and their consistency and their execution and how theyre coached and the way they use their talent i have been impressed with they are a pretty good football team and a good program
6920108 they reached the semifinals last year so did eastern washington maybe that would be a similar comparison to draw if we had to draw a comparison but their consistency and their precision and their execution to me is whats impressive

6920120 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6920121 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now
6920122 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6920123 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6920124 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6920125 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now

6920127 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6920128 we want to play our best players that give us the best chance to win
6920129 for our football teams sake its time to get ready for our opening game this decision puts more focus on where it should be now
6920130 it probably wasnt up to the expectations of the usa team but we did the best we could do
6920131 hopefully in a couple more years things are going to get better we went to a whole new program and trying new things whatd you expect this is the first time the residents have been together for a year youre not going to come out with everybody on top
6920132 i know there will be a lot of changes in the program this right here was an experience of checking off were going to keep this here were going to knock this out youre going to see greatness in the coming years
6920133 it probably wasnt up to the expectations of the usa team but we did the best we could do
6920134 hopefully in a couple more years things are going to get better we went to a whole new program and trying new things whatd you expect this is the first time the residents have been together for a year youre not going to come out with everybody on top

6920136 im not saying these fighters are on par with the leonards
6920137 they dont have that talent when you watched those fights without head gear and without the confines of this kind of style you saw a fight they were only three rounds but you saw a fight and you liked to watch it i dont know a lot of people who like watching this
6920138 you can always negotiate down but when was the last time you negotiated up
6920139 we worked on a project similar to yours and the final cost was xx
6920140 that is xx times more than it would cost to do xx
6920141 i dont think you understand my project because you are estimating far less than xx
6920142 i will pay you 5 000 per month to help me figure out this problem
6920143 risks significant misuse of funds in this 39 billion program
6920144 has seriously degraded cms ability to meet its responsibilities in combating fraud and abuse
6920145 this is unacceptable some plan sponsors are dragging their feet on required anti fraud prevention and cms is letting them get away with it
6920146 harding and bradshaw would have found the same as me you spend a lot of time soul searching by yourself in gyms and on the running track during the off season
6920147 when the guys had eight weeks off after the season and over christmas i had a heavy training schedule just to try to get myself right
6920148 im sure the other boys would say the same thing when something thats so important in your life gets taken away from you it really hits home and thats what happened in my case
6920149 id only ever missed one or two games of footy once youve been through something like that you appreciate little things in footy and life in general
6920150 it also helps mentally as well because you have to jump over such a large hurdle to come back from an injury like that
6920151 once you get over that hurdle and begin to play footy again its a real sense of achievement because youve come back from something so serious
6920152 im not surprised what hes doing from the change of position but from a physical perspective now to what hes doing coming off a knee reconstruction its unbelievable really
6920153 its full credit to him hes been a desperate man and he wants to continue his career which is great
6920154 most guys struggle with it but those three have been exceptional
6920155 leighs season i know it hurt him a lot when he did it in the last training session of the year and had to sit out a whole footy season
6920156 we only knew him as a small forward who could kick goals no one knew he was a half back flanker who could beat his opponent and run off
6920157 its a credit to him because hes been fantastic for us
6920158 having jas sam and i in the mix helps our four quarter spread through the midfield and spread of fresh legs
6920159 i just want to get a kick actually i have been terrible to be honest with you in the last couple of weeks
6920160 we him and coach matthew knights always said to each other we would have a go this year and see what happened and if it worked it worked and if it didnt it didnt
6920161 hes up and running it will be touch and go but if he gets the all clear hes ready to go and hes making steady progress
6920162 if were fortunate enough to make it and go through the finals series and its too late for him to play vfl and theyre not in the finals then its all done on the training track
6920163 technically they do need to play but as much as it is a concern its not the be all and end all because you can still fit a lot of work into people on the training track
6920164 anthonys been a pretty good touch player in the past two or three seasons
6920165 i would say five years ago when he came back from injuries he bubbled it like you would after missing that many weeks
6920166 but in recent years ill say the last three seasons hes come back in and shown pretty good touch
6920167 any of the emergencies are a chance to play thats why you name them
6920168 thats a good shot but im pretty disciplined on this
6920169 whatever decision he makes im going to respect that decision and im going to support him
6920170 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6920171 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6920172 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6920173 this is what you want you want several days worth of press you want the excitement to build and you want to be able to go out there with a bang
6920174 when you have a hammer you see all problems as a nail
6920175 i count myself as a conservative republican yet i view it to a large degree in the theodore roosevelt mold
6920176 the conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem unless we solve that problem it will avail us little to solve all others
6920177 i came into the season underdone and i think that showed but its slowly starting to come back in the last four to five weeks i have started to get a few kicks again
6920178 the pre season wasnt the way i wanted it to be i would have liked it to have been a couple of weeks longer just to get a little bit more fitness
6920179 i had a pretty big year last year so i got held back a little bit but in hindsight we should have started normally and this pre season i will start from day one
6920180 i always knew if i kept my workrate up in games and during the week it was going to come together
6920181 you feel it a bit more when you dont have anthony rocca he was a real focal point and took a lot of attention with the three forwards going down it threw our whole forward structure out
6920182 but with the inclusion of john anthony and chris dawes the last month has been good
6920183 i was out with suspension the week anthony and ben went down and anthony has always been a bigger bodied focal point i will normally get the no 1 defender now no matter what
6920184 but jack has been kicking his goals and paul medhurst has been drawing away attention too so we have three or four forwards standing up again in the forward half
6920185 yeah hes had a few different ones but i have done a few myself he walked into telstra dome and everyone gave him a friendly mouthful and mick said a few words eddie said a few words
6920186 a lot of people have different personalities and jack is like that too he doesnt like being called john its jack but we all get along with him and have a laugh and a giggle there are one or two players like that at every club and we have got one in john

6920220 some people will choose not to work there at the unionized shops subject to testing
6920221 the golden rule of negotiated labour agreements is that you cannot contract out of human rights laws
6920222 there would be a lot of lawyers willing to take the case and i expect it to be tested
6920223 you cant contract out your constitutional rights or your human rights random drug testing of workers is never justified
6920224 the objective is to ensure sobriety on the job without prying into the private after hours activities of workers
6920225 we opted for a non invasive testing policy which is designed to measure possible current impairment on the job not what you did last week
6920226 this is precisely the stumbling block for allowing drug testing in the workplace
6920227 are predicated on the fact that whats causing safety concerns is employees impairment we would like to see some evidence of that

6920494 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6920495 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause

6920523 when parents talk about discipline they mean a rigid set of rules to prevent their children from misbehaving but the only discipline worthy of the name lies in providing a solid framework of ideals not for the child to live up to but for the parents to live within you can beat children until they are black and you are blue but it cannot make them any better than the examples they see around them every day

6920548 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6920549 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6920550 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6920551 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6920552 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6920553 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side we ask that the media respect our need to begin the process of dealing with this unexpected tragedy and to begin the grieving process
6920554 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6920555 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6920556 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6920557 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6920558 im not going to sell the players on a cap again
6920559 once we go through the cap why should we agree to it again
6920560 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6920561 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions

6920617 by divine design fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children in these sacred responsibilities fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners disability death or other circumstances may necessitate individual adaptation extended families should lend support when needed
6920618 often the answers will come as you study the scriptures they contain accounts of what the lord did in his mortal ministry and the guidance he has given his servants they have doctrine in them which will apply in every time and every situation pondering the scriptures will lead you to ask the right questions in prayer and just as surely as the heavens were opened to joseph smith after he pondered the scriptures in faith god will answer your prayers and he will lead you by the hand

6920624 ive made 250 plate appearances for the last five or six years so thats what we were kind of shooting for blum said
6920625 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days harris said
6920626 ive heard that so many times and its never really happened to me before until today it was just a good win for us we fought back the whole game
6920627 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6920628 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else harris said
6920629 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6920630 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in
6920631 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6920632 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park said harris whose 12 homers this season are five more than he had in his entire career before 2008
6920633 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out
6920634 it was wonderful to get out of silicon valley and talk to people about what is happening to innovation
6920635 too often we get caught up in our own little world in the valley and we dont see what is happening elsewhere
6920636 so in other words government is planning some kind of
6920637 the legendary song writer and producer desmond child introduced the idea to us we wanted to make a new album with the band that is more mature and not so much songs where girls are chasing boys or boys are chasing girls something deep this is a time to turn back around to find the road to humanity to find love and respect for each other in this world it is one thing to play rock you like a hurricane and to have fun theres nothing wrong with that but there is so much more to it so many parts of the world where we played we had the feeling that music can build bridges and make connections with people
6920638 when we watch the news every night on the tv that is reality in the world of music we live in the world of emotions music can create a feeling and so what we try to do is to send out positive vibes in the world we hope through music we can change but a song cannot change the world it is not a rock revolution anymore those days are over it is not the 60s anymore
6920639 obviously the technology is this advanced so you have to live with what there is once something is free people dont understand why they have to pay for it again which i can understand also but in the end you are destroying the basis for the artist to make music
6920640 from top to bottom the whole project is my alter ego tripple beam reem my reflection of the hood
6920641 oh yeah did i mention im now peeing in a bag

6920646 dont forget to mention the fact that im peeing into a bag
6920647 we were wondering if we could get some food up here to the the conversation went on for some time after that but it did result in a tray of food for me so i guess you cant question my fathers charmingly loud verbosity hospital food is an interesting thing in my experience its not particularly bad or particularly good its just fine but you eat it like it was the best thing you had ever tasted in your entire life or at least i did theres wasnt much to look forward to in a typical day at south nassau hospital there were the cute student nurses from molloy college looking all sexy and vulnerable with their little notebooks and pens that was always a nice treat there was oprah of course and the cafeteria with a full stock of lindens chocolate chip cookies but other than those few bright spots the three high points of a day in the hospital are breakfast lunch and dinner i imagine its the same thing in prison although i cannot speak about that from personal experience yet hospital meal was heralded by the squeaky rumbling of the cavernous food cart the hospital food cart is not unlike one that you would find one a plane before planes stopped serving hot food its a big cart with plenty of room for multiple trays and it somehow manages to keep everything hot with the help of molded plastic plate covers over the entrees each tray has a printed sheet of paper with the persons last name and first name often followed by dietary restrictions or special instructions if the server gives you the wrong entre at applebees no biggie but if they do it in the hospital you might die which is sort of a biggie hospital food isnt like airplane food its the real deal full portions of meatloaf or chicken or spaghetti and its the same stuff that they sell in the hospital cafeteria only you get it for free and they throw in some pudding or jello or something for dessert honestly youd be amazed at what you will eat when you have no other choice i know i was so there i was eating off my first ever hospital tray flanked by my dad on one guest chair and my mom on another when the kapur
6920648 and we both agree that it might be wise to perfrom a is a procedure where we insert a scope with a tiny fiber optic camera attached to it into your large colon and part of the small bowel
6920649 this allows us to see if there are any polyps or tumors and to remove them if necessary for biopsy
6920650 well we insert a tiny camera on the end of a scope through the anus into the colon
6920651 it transmits video from within your large colon and bowel and we watch it on a tv
6920652 well we need to clear your colon of all solid material before the procedure can be done
6920653 so monday would be good that means you would consume only clear fluids over the weekend like apple juice or bouillon
6920654 your colon must be cleared of all solid matter through a process of diet and a laxative such as

6920909 the united states and ghana enjoy warm relations and a shared commitment to promote peace and prosperity in africa and throughout the world
6920910 the two presidents will discuss efforts to combat malaria and neglected tropical diseases as well as ghanas efforts to promote democratic values peace and stability in africa
6920911 if they did that in ireland it would be terrible
6920912 that was our last major run as a team and it was pretty good
6920913 some of the factors are hard to explain and hard to see but you can tell everyone is very responsive when someones talking you get a lot of eyes directed straight at you
6920914 at the contest at the breakdown guys are really getting in there getting stuck in i tend to think thats a good thing
6920915 the positive mindset to put ourselves under as much pressure as you can at training and to execute under those pressures are some of the things that have been going on this week
6920916 i dont think there were any uppercuts just good intensity there is no question that is going to be really important on saturday
6920917 you cant help but look at a teams form leading up to a test match
6920918 part of that is doing your analysis of how they are playing and part of it is probably in their mindset as well
6920919 in the last test in new zealand we knew they were going to come out to us with a fair bit of intensity and unfortunately we didnt match it
6920920 thats probably going to be the case again this time hopefully we will match it
6920921 its a massive challenge in front of us south africa are a really proud nation especially at home we are expecting a significant battle
6920922 they have the world cup tag so there is still an underlying confidence with that
6920923 it wasnt too long back when they secured that amazing victory in dunedin the last couple of matches they may not have gone as well as they would have liked to
6920924 ive got no doubt theyll look to bounce back there is still a lot of confidence in their team
6920925 they are missing a few guys bryan habana and bakkies botha who are quite crucial for them but theyve still got guys who are the worlds best in their positions they are a pretty handy crew
6920926 i think thats a good thing there is a lot less baggage among this crew at the moment
6920927 we possibly saw that in that first test against the all blacks in sydney and hopefully we can see that over the next two matches
6920928 it was a long time ago great memories about that whole trip that whole era really
6920929 it was a victory that reflected the team at that time we were involved in many wins where we came from behind and won late that was just one of a number of times we did that
6920930 it has been in the context of as you would have seen publicly of involvement also with western australia and the western australian government
6920931 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
6920932 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
6920933 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
6920934 we have been talking with them and we have been talking with the gmb today
6920935 they did speak with acas but just to say they wouldnt talk to them
6920936 they said theyll talk to us after the strike when theyve had time to reflect on how much money theyve lost
6920937 they called this morning and said if we cancel the strike well talk to you on wednesday i took that to the members and their response wasnt very good as you might imagine

6920940 the vast majority of transgressions like liquids are genuine mistakes people recognise they have to pass through security but its not something they want to do you have to make sure you get the balance right between customer services and ensuring security and then you have to maintain a high level of concentration in what are fairly mundane circumstances until of course some thing happens
6920941 they all understand what the nature of the job is
6920942 everyone wants to get on their flight quickly or theyre on holiday and see it as a chore the operators need to maintain their level of service and ensure theres no breach of security its a challenging task and of course its got to be done thoroughly
6920943 you cant cut corners if the queue is very long theres little you can do to speed that up as an individual but that doesnt mean people who are late wont get irate
6920944 theyre given regular changeovers and there are regulations around those who are operating the machinery particularly the viewing screen
6920945 off the top of my head i think its either a twenty minute or half hour cycle trouble is that only adds to some customers frustration youre in the queue and then you see staff changing over

6920958 the jmg goal is for students to secure a quality job or post secondary education that leads to a meaningful career we believe the best way to achieve this objective is to keep students in school and to improve their success in the workforce by helping them acquire employability skills before leaving high school students are selected for the program because they have barriers to successful completion of high school and job entry
6920959 the program is aimed at meeting their academic social and cultural needs
6920960 honestly when they first drafted him i was like who is this guy whyd we get him and now i see the guys a playmaker im glad ive got him on the other side
6920961 i didnt know he had those type of receiving skills
6920962 i thought we drafted him a little bit more as a returner i didnt really realize he could be our starting z flanker hes a go getter he picked up the offense quick he attacks the football hes got great speed gets in and out of cuts hes fun in the huddle he understands what were doing
6920963 it hasnt happened that way before but we have never picked with the 12th pick either you have a little bit better chance but you dont always know in the second round if that guy is going to be there
6920964 i thought he was the best wide receiver versus bump coverage that came out in the draft
6920965 a lot of guys you get in the second round as wide receivers its a years growth it takes a while to understand the nfl and get used to it but this is the type of guy that has the ability to help us in special teams and he doesnt have to help us right away on offense
6920966 there could have been if royal wasnt there we had a number of options to move back and we could have gotten a third or a fourth depending on how far back you want to go you can do that quite a bit but sometimes when you do that you lose out on guys that you think can help your football team
6920967 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6920968 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6920969 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6920970 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6920971 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6920972 the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but

6920974 man is but a reed the most feeble thing in nature but he is a thinking reed the entire universe need not arm itself to crush him a vapor a drop of water suffices to kill him but if the universe were to crush him man would still be more noble than that which killed him because he knows that he dies and the advantage which the universe has over him the universe knows nothing of this
6920975 i hope i wont have to go on the disabled list

6920977 her favorite song will say more about her than her mouth ever will
6920978 you cannot take a strong stance from a dependent position
6920979 since we have won the past two years how could we not have a target on our back
6920980 i think the target is only as big as you make it we go game by game day by day and if we take it one step at a time well be fine for the conference games the big ten tournament and so on we cant look too far ahead but its always in the back of our minds each game is win or lose it is not a given
6920981 weve been to the national tournament a couple of times and it ended the same way with losing in the first round i think we have a lot of returners and upperclassmen who are going to do whatever it takes to not allow that again we are one year better one year more fit and were one year stronger on the ball we know what to expect and were excited to get started
6920982 that was a huge momentum boost for us we had a great game against wake did really well and came out against north carolina and played a horrible first half we played a great second half and actually we thought we won three of the four halves that was huge for us were looking to do the same thing take a half at a time a game at a time and at the end of that weekend ideally we need a split
6920983 i think we have a great team and an awesome coaching staff we lost two seniors last season and one all around starter so on paper it doesnt take a field hockey professional to realize what we have we are really excited to show what we have were also really excited to learn what we have wake forest is extremely strong every year and we will be excited to see how we match up against that
6920984 these three scrimmages we have had we have never had before in a season
6920985 its really good game preparation for next weekend what were coming into we really want to focus on coming out strong and doing one game at a time its my last year so i want to play every game and leave everything on the field each time
6920986 this was a great experience for us to have three games where we are actually putting on the black and gold and playing against another team
6920987 you know how it is in any sport you practice against yourself you beat each other up you know each others moves you lose a little bit more of that motivation so i think our team will be physically and mentally ready to play next weekend we wouldnt be doing what were doing if we werent embracing every single day stepping out on the field and training together the energy is great
6920988 i do think were capable of winning a national title
6920989 we need to develop and i think that is what we are looking to do with every week either we are doing it with longer stretches of time or were playing ends of halves better were going to try and keep building every single week i really think we can be there but its not something im talking to myself about every day its more what kind of work we need to put into it where we need to come along with our team and that will take care of itself
6920990 being a hawkeye and being on this field is motivation in itself just wearing the hawk and iowa on my jersey are more than i could have asked for
6920991 we start off with a bang and were not afraid to do it
6920992 the last time vangelis and demis roussos worked together on an album they decided to collect a set of songs from the old days their effort for reflection is by some regarded as their worst cooperation ever the songs sounding kind of cheesy fortunately there are also people who enjoy listening to this so you better find out for yourself

6920997 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so thought i would give it a shot and see if it works
6920998 we are here today to side with the people and to help them save at the pump immediately
6920999 this program is no substitute for a consistent long term national energy policy but it provides immediate and tangible relief from high gas prices just by following some simple recommendations drivers can get 15 percent better gas mileage save money at the pump and reduce demand for foreign oil during the transition to more renewable and secure energy sources well all benefit and save money from the most efficient use of gasoline
6921000 well spend about 2 200 a day running our school busses
6921001 they were telling us any way you can shorten your route you need to
6921002 rather than benefiting just one small group we wanted to look at the entire community and try and preserve the way of life that we have in randolph county
6921003 the sheriff will get the inmates to go out and do the labor to wash off the graffiti that is if the owner of the property would not handle it himself
6921004 its just one of the out front tactics that we along with the community can do to get it off and to show that were not gonna take this lying down
6921005 were gonna fight for our community to keep it looking good and theyre not going to take possession of it
6921006 sometimes they will strike the same place twice and if they do we just need to be vigilant and stay on top of it
6921007 if they put it up were gonna have it taken off
6921008 we certainly did not realize the extent of the graffiti in asheboro and certainly we know were on the right track as we become knowledgeable about whats going on in our community
6921009 weve been open a little over two years and things have gone pretty well
6921010 were hoping this is going to have a huge positive impact on our business as a whole
6921011 you can figure 800 to 3 000 people almost every week that were open
6921012 weve already started hiring new servers and bartenders were doing a lot more staff training
6921013 we dont do lunch on the weekends and we dont do anything on sunday so were trying to ascertain if we want to open up saturday lunch for instance or sunday brunch
6921014 rankings like u s news are one of many ways that we use to measure the quality of what happens at duke
6921015 its a very imprecise and imperfect in some cases arbitrary ranking but on the other hand if there is going to be a list of the top ten universities in the country we want to be on it
6921016 its great that were still in the top 10 but of course when i was applying for colleges we were in the top four or top five so its still a little lower than i would like for us to be
6921017 that is presumably because were an up and coming institution a place where a lot of interesting and exciting things are happening
6921018 he played a whole game last year against san diego with torn biceps most guys cant do that hes a football player he wants to play hell be there
6921019 the true soldier fights not because he hates what is in front of him but
6921020 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
6921021 i end up either hurting them or making them change their mind about me either way they end up hating me in the end
6921022 greek boats have been sailing these mediterranean waters for three to four thousand years how is it possible for israel to act like the police and say who can enter the sea and who cant and then say it wants peaceful co existence with the mediterranean people
6921023 the palestinians who are imprisoned in this huge open prison have the same human rights as people the world over they have the right to use their sea freely like the rest of the mediterranean people
6921024 about the right of palestinians to live freely as freely as israelis cypriots greeks and americans
6921025 we can all use a little freedom but no one more than the palestinians
6921026 im an emergency room physician from a small town so im pretty good at what you call wilderness medicine
6921027 there were no walls back then it was easy to go back and forth palestinians were used as cheap labour back then there was oppression but it wasnt a lockdown like today
6921028 every time i go back i say this is horrible things couldnt get worse than this but they do
6921029 they needed a captain so i came i only checked out the boat today shes a beauty
6921030 if they pull us in theres an argument for kidnapping weve got both us and international lawyers academics theoreticians ready to get involved
6921031 when you are not violating international law and someone drags you against your will somewhere else thats kidnapping
6921032 the israelis claim they have rights over gazan territorial waters from the oslo accords but they dont they only have the right to patrol the waters for security reasons and its already been acknowledged we are not a security threat thats very clear
6921033 we have nothing to do with hamas we are going to a population thats imprisoned this is what states do they try to scare people by telling them theyre helping terrorism like in the 1950s when everyone was seen as a communist threat
6921034 as an israeli citizen i cant go to gaza to see friends and they cant come to see us
6921035 as a palestinian for too long israel has tried to make us feel powerless
6921036 and as a human being im appalled by whats happening and horrified that governments world leaders and institutions established to uphold peoples dignity and human rights are not doing anything about what israel is doing to palestine
6921037 we palestinians have the power to mobilise to make change we deserve the freedom to live with dignity and wont rest until that happens
6921038 people of the world are not powerless to make a world they want to live in not one where people are punished starved and humiliated because they are of a certain race religion or ethnicity
6921039 lol shutup hes old enough to be your dad the guys like 60
6921040 stop exaggerating ive always been all omg abt him since i was waaaaay younger
6921041 not allowed hes old i bet you dig kobe as well and i dont
6921042 i first got the idea to do the film when i visited the plain of jars in laos in 2002
6921043 you could still see the craters from the air bombing and unexploded ordnance was everywhere
6921044 then i heard about long chen and the fact that no one had got there since the war and i thought how do i visit and how do i make a film about it
6921045 i found it bizarre that at one time this was the second biggest city in laos and it was completely secret
6921046 laos was the progenitor of the way america fights wars in the 21st century
6921047 outsourcing the war to private companies gathering public support by falsifying intelligence and documents embedded journalism and automated warfare including the use of so called smart weapons all these methods were first tested in laos
6921048 the cia had just declassified a whole lot of material so that helped as well
6921049 the most important source was the guys who were over there filming with their little super 8 cameras often illegally
6921050 we destroyed a whole civilisation we wiped it off the map we incinerated atomised human remains in this air war and what happened in the end we lost
6921051 after we went another uk crew tried to get there but they were caught and deported
6921052 there are some places in the world that have a different energy and long chen is one of these you look down the runway and think this is the place were it all happened the planes took off from here and bombed all those people
6921053 its just an army outpost now a small village a couple of hundred people soldiers and their families
6921054 the golden age of long chen is over it used to be the high tech oasis for spooks in laos there were allegedly more antennas there than trees now they do not even have power
6921055 there are still some groups but they are not organised they are certainly not politically or militarily organised they are remnants the children and grandchildren of those involved in the war who are scared to come out of the jungle because they have never known anything else
6921056 whether vang pao is guilty or not of the charges he is facing one thing that is true is that he and other expatriate hmong have used these people as pawns
6921057 vang pao has also got millions of dollars out of the hmong community in the u s under the guise of liberating their homeland
6921058 i do not see that happening in the next few years it is still far too sensitive on the part of the lao government

6921158 it was a complicated case and it should have been handled differently
6921159 the thing that concerns me is that they care we have to make sure this doesnt happen again so were going to monitor their care and make sure they follow through on improvements

6921163 nothing could have saved joe but the care there was hateful and incompetent
6921164 the study has very little to do with their diagnosis and it is not consistent with what occurred
6921165 dr bergmann made it very clear to us that the benefit of signing up for the study would be that she would develop an individual profile of joe that would help them to arrive at a diagnosis faster
6921166 he was released because his work up was complete we did all the tests we could have done
6921167 he was in need of hospice care and that is what castle point provides
6921168 wasnt concerned about my day to day life he wasnt concerned with my wartime experiences he wasnt concerned about if i was going to make it home safely after the appointment
6921169 it is only when there is no therapy or the therapy that is available is of doubtful utility that someone can be recruited to research
6921170 every researcher and every institution that does research must be sure to make an accurate diagnosis of a patient to then offer them whatever therapy is available at the institution to give them all their options in terms of treatment anywhere else and then and only then to pursue the possibility of trying something new in a research study
6921171 no one should ever be penalized for failing to volunteer for a study ever
6921172 the goal of any medical encounter must be first and foremost to provide the latest and best care when care is available
6921173 the chance to participate as a subject in research has to take a secondary role to receiving care as a patient
6921174 the research team is completely independent of the clinical team and the clinical team has priority and determines if a person is approachable
6921175 the decision to place this museum in las cruces is important because its what our state veterans wanted not something politicians decided for them
6921176 its the first time where veterans got to have direct input in deciding if they wanted a museum and where they wanted it
6921177 all of the presentations made by the six communities who participated were excellent but i have to tell you las cruces did a hell of a job the city that won won by acclamation
6921178 the decision to place this museum in las cruces is important because its what our state veterans wanted not something politicians decided for them
6921179 i want to thank the task force for their hard work and for giving the veterans of new mexico a voice on a museum dedicated to honoring their service and sacrifice
6921180 each of these communities should be proud of the strong cases they made
6921181 new mexico has a unique and rich legacy of military service that dates back generations to the early formation of our country and state this museum will present an opportunity to preserve and protect this rich history for future generations to come
6921182 in 1536 the first military people in new mexico came through las cruces in these last seven years ive tried to get people to believe in a museum
6921183 i worked on securing 200 000 in operational money for the museum in our state budget now that las cruces has been chosen those funds can be used to hire a museum director who can start the planning process and the acquisition of exhibits i am encouraging the administration to get busy on the museum we are all so anxious for this tribute to our fighting men and women
6921184 this museum is going to be an incredible addition to our city personally i feel grateful that its coming here
6921185 it will be important that we come out of the box with a compelling product to draw more interest

6921238 i think weve been influential when we engage in countries like china its important that we engage with 1 3 billion people
6921239 chinas human rights record is directly tied to its surging economic power since so many jobs that used to be done by canadians have disappeared as companies take full advantage of sweatshop conditions in china

6921286 we are optimistic of reaching agreement with the lenders under our senior credit facility and finding an acceptable solution for the subordinated notes
6921287 however terms for such agreement and solution acceptable to the company may not be available and therefore there are no guarantees we will successfully achieve compliance with the senior credit facility or be able to address our future requirements under the subordinated notes
6921288 this is good for both organizations it helps strengthen goodwills services to the community and at the same time it takes the great services worc as been able to provide to an organization that can financially support them

6921291 reached an understanding on a unique process that will allow arcelormittal dofasco employees the opportunity to test the suitability of a union to its unique working culture
6921292 i want you to give serious consideration to being a part of this partnership there are some excellent examples of successful partnerships like this within the the steel industry based on a trade union model one which places a priority on problem solving trust and mutual respect
6921293 getting the best deal that they can get for us
6921294 if it looks like a duck quacks like a duck it is a duck
6921295 its clear before the usw comes back to dofasco it has to mount a major education effort to overcome nearly a century of ignorance about the true role of a labour union in the modern industrial world
6921296 many writers on this blog seemed to be quaking in fear that joining a union inevitably meant going on strike thats not true
6921297 at the bottom of much of the anti union rhetoric however was the belief
6921298 many writers on this blog seemed to be quaking in fear that joining a union inevitably meant going on strike thats not true when theres mutual respect and willingness on both sides in a contract negotiation working conditions and pay can be improved without confrontation

6921304 yes sir for a long time looks like a connection overdose theyre still plugged in i dont see any life support or monitoring systems anywhere on their bodies sir i
6921305 then their systems have been running without them the police the fabricated politicians the corporations we have been run by machines not by men the men have died and their machines lived on and we did not know

6921310 in an earlier survey on the election and health care reform physicians were fairly evenly divided as to the solution for improving our health care system
6921311 twenty seven percent said it was universal health care with multi payer reimbursement twenty three percent said it was universal health care with single payer reimbursement and twenty five percent selected tax credits to allow more people to afford healthcare
6921312 universal health care would reduce my income in the short term but the longer term effect would be good since the current system isnt sustainable
6921313 more regulatory and bureaucratic hoops to jump through decreased income perhaps a decreased workload as access to care plummets
6921314 you know mom that steff and i are simply roommates do me a favor and dont go getting any wild ideas
6921315 ever since we had your mom over to dinner i cant seem to find that solid silver gravy ladle you dont think she took it do you
6921316 nah i dont think that my mom would do that but i will write her a letter just in case
6921317 dear mom im not saying that you did take the gravy ladle from my house and i am not saying that you didnt take it but the fact remains that ever since we had you over for dinner one has gone missing
6921318 we have been talking with them and we have been talking with the gmb today
6921319 they did speak with acas but just to say they wouldnt talk to them
6921320 they said theyll talk to us after the strike when theyve had time to reflect on how much money theyve lost
6921321 they called this morning and said if we cancel the strike well talk to you on wednesday i took that to the members and their response wasnt very good as you might imagine
6921322 it is an act of gross irresponsibility that a contractor engaged in operating an airport is refusing an offer of conciliation to resolve a long standing pay dispute
6921323 the vast majority of transgressions like liquids are genuine mistakes people recognise they have to pass through security but its not something they want to do you have to make sure you get the balance right between customer services and ensuring security and then you have to maintain a high level of concentration in what are fairly mundane circumstances until of course some thing happens
6921324 they all understand what the nature of the job is
6921325 everyone wants to get on their flight quickly or theyre on holiday and see it as a chore the operators need to maintain their level of service and ensure theres no breach of security its a challenging task and of course its got to be done thoroughly
6921326 you cant cut corners if the queue is very long theres little you can do to speed that up as an individual but that doesnt mean people who are late wont get irate
6921327 theyre given regular changeovers and there are regulations around those who are operating the machinery particularly the viewing screen
6921328 off the top of my head i think its either a twenty minute or half hour cycle trouble is that only adds to some customers frustration youre in the queue and then you see staff changing over

6921334 they dont feel at this time that theres a need to be afraid about whats changing with respect to consolidation in the steel industry
6921335 they believe nothing will change and things will be okay and itll be like it was before when dofasco was a canadian company and we gotta respect that

6921444 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6921445 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6921446 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6921447 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6921448 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6921449 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6921450 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6921451 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6921452 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
6921453 any tax increase plan wont pass with republican votes absolutely not
6921454 it will hurt the state and hurt people on fixed incomes
6921455 theres a silent majority in california against yet another tax increase
6921456 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6921457 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6921458 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6921459 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6921460 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6921461 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6921462 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6921463 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6921464 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it
6921465 we were well ahead of schedule most of the morning the rocket lifted off pitched over as it was supposed to but continued to veer south
6921466 we knew the risks of launching payloads on a first of its kind rocket
6921467 i would call it a very big disappointment but not a setback
6921468 this morning before the launch i said we have learned an incredible amount anything from this point on is a bonus i was actually hoping for a bigger bonus than we got
6921469 in fact i am quite broad minded but this is completely inappropriate for children i bought the book for my niece as a present and was reading it when i came across the word
6921470 the book has an attractive cover and is clearly for children they should not have to be subjected to trash and vulgarity
6921471 i did not expect this from a well respected author and do not want my young niece to have to see this obscene slang
6921472 she comes to visit me regularly and we read to each other
6921473 we have all the enid blyton books such as the famous five and secret seven and had finished all of them
6921474 i thought i would get her something a little more modern and had heard about jacqueline wilson through the popular tracy beaker television series
6921475 i got to the page where reference was made to a toffee nosed twit
6921476 on the next page the word changed i thought i was mistaken but then i saw to my shock it had been repeated twice again
6921477 i asked her if she was aware of this word and if she could do something about it
6921478 i would like her to explain how she would want me to explain this to my daughter even if it is in the context of the character
6921479 in the context of the character we felt it was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie would speak to each other
6921480 the book is aimed at children aged 10 and over and we felt it was acceptable for that age range
6921481 however in light of this response we have decided to amend the word when we reprint the book
6921482 since the book was launched in march this year we have sold over 28 000 copies and this is the first complaint we have had jacqueline wilson books are extremely popular with our customers and are the top selling childrens books in most high street stores
6921483 it hasnt really been an issue so far because ive never had any major illness or injury or prescriptions that i have to pay a bunch of money for or anything like that
6921484 i did have health insurance when i was going to school but i stopped going to the u about a year ago now
6921485 a students private health insurance information is subject to periodic audits providing inaccurate or false information may result in unexpected charges and is a violation of the student conduct code
6921486 we get better rates overall by having a mandatory insurance plan
6921487 you have to weigh individual benefits versus community benefits its best for the entire community because we can keep the rates low
6921488 even if people think theyre invulnerable they still need insurance students say they cant afford it but by not having insurance they could end up in bankruptcy
6921489 right now the federal government isnt doing much to address this problem
6921490 our healthcare system is built with holes in it and we need to fix it
6921491 after i graduate hopefully i will find a job that will give me health insurance
6921492 all the indicators that make it our way make it seem like theyre in crisis mode
6921493 the fact that we are looking to out of the state agencies with these few days to go tells me that the ball was dropped

6921513 between them they have had a wretched run at the box office in the past few years recently the bachchans are too much about the brand too much about cashing in on the brand and not enough about the films
6921514 given how hard adults find it to cope with a series like big brother to put children in that environment is asking for trouble

6921517 what i had not known until late october was that the small story i had been planning out with charts and maps and sketches would actually turn into a full fledged novel that would become my every breath

6921524 i can assure you my debit card hasnt left my wallet
6921525 well youll have to come into the office tomorrow when we can see what the holds are then but they are probably charges that you made and youll need to cover the over draft
6921526 i called earlier and spoke to chris who said that i have charged over 700 dollars in the last 24 hours and somehow forgotten it which is why im overdrawn but i noticed that the amount of the charges is the exact same amount as my paycheck
6921527 i know exactly which key the teller hit wrong sir the holds have been cleared youll be fine
6921528 the signing of this important protocol is a welcome boost to uk exporters i hope that the uks positive relationship with the chinese veterinary authorities will soon lead to the uk selling pig meat to the chinese market

6921548 to find so many polar bears at sea at one time is extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to melt many more bears may be out there facing similar risk
6921549 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
6921550 while these bears are swimming around in an ice free coastal arctic ocean the only thing the state of alaska is doing is suing the federal government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears
6921551 the bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice sea ice is decaying and the bears are in very serious trouble for any people who are still non believers in global warming and the impacts it is having in the arctic this should answer their doubts once and for all
6921552 the situation is compounded by the fact that our affiliates are committed to the future and sustainability of the and it is impractical for them to honor their own obligations in the form of banks loans letters of credit financing with the venezuelan state inces education training municipality taxes employee benefits and their own suppliers and customers they are suffering from capitalization of their assets and lack of cash flow which prevent them from meeting contractual obligations they have assumed under contracts signed with the cvg itself

6921556 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process

6921590 you pretty much work to drive now and so i try to save money so i can go out on the weekends and have fun so i ride the bus everyday instead of drive
6921591 we have 40 ride the bus and last year we saw that number steadily increasing at every level but especially at the high school level
6921592 we can go in and schedule when the room is occupied or unoccupied
6921593 in the process we have saved a lot of money as a school district
6921594 we have been putting increased money into our transit police but we cant be everywhere all the time

6921604 mikes wrestling is sick and tito is a really tough guy it would be a good fight for mike i would also love to see mike fight a guy like trevor prangley or maybe even drop down to 185 to fight say a renzo gracie or someone like that

6921607 its a lot easier if everywhere in lombard is 25 miles per hour
6921608 if you still support it i think we need to move forward
6921609 i dont agree with this piecemeal approach it should be more uniform its logical
6921610 it can be done just not as easily as in other communities
6921611 people will drive the speed they believe they can reasonably drive
6921612 were in our 44th year and the program has definitely grown
6921613 the area does get a huge influx of traffic on the weekends
6921614 maybe people can car pool or bring a bus so there isnt so many vehicles its tough when people park on both sides of the street the street is only 32 feet wide and it wasnt designed for that
6921615 it will be an inconvenience and people may have to park farther away but i understand why village officials did this
6921616 people were parking illegally sometimes this will be a safer environment
6921617 i think everyone was just too busy and we didnt get the vendors
6921618 it was a combination of things but everyone the staff and committee members were busy doing other things
6921619 spectator attendance has been slim except for some of the bigger events so i am hoping we can capture people coming out for the rides and live music

6921625 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
6921626 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellant relatively little is known about how it actually works
6921627 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellants are compared
6921628 this basic intervention implementing a household smoking ban has the potential to promote antismoking norms and to prevent adolescent smoking
6921629 this study provides evidence that even in a smoke free home environment parental behavior remains a strong influence on teen smoking attitudes and behavior
6921630 these bans send a strong message to teens that its not ok to smoke and in the face of so many other external factors that may influence teens to smoke peers advertising a home smoking policy is one thing that parents can control to some extent

6921701 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6921702 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6921703 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6921704 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6921800 in retrospect the u s culture of the house party played a major role in spreading the value of wii to a bigger circle faster than we ever predicted all of my american friends keep telling me man the wii is the ultimate party machine laughs but none of that was intentional on our part all we did was ask ourselves how to pack the most smiles and surprises into the product as we developed it fortunately we hit a sweet spot as a result interest in the wii has spread across the u s surprisingly quickly
6921801 i think that nintendo figuring that their technology was kind of last generation were just not just thinking about going higher than 300 they certainly could have charged 400 until they exhausted that demand then cut the prices to 300 and exhausted that demand and they always would have been able to supply them
6921802 what strategies are they using that made them so successful
6921803 it never occurred to them that the demand for the wii would outstrip demand for the ps2

6921816 why should the president consult the people with respect to the parameters of power
6921817 the government has not given its consent to the moa
6921818 so it is not a contract not an agreement yet
6921819 what is the value of this document it is not signed there is no basis there is nothing anymore to prohibit
6921820 with the absence of the signature of the people who are authorized to sign it is not yet a perfected document
6921821 on the basis of that document you referring to chief negotiator rodolfo garcia do not carry the full power of the president your authority is only based on the document
6921822 in the last two plebiscites the subject matter was armm autonomous region in muslim mindanao right and armm the organic act of armm does not provide that the armm will have its internal police security force its own courts its own comelec correct

6921824 the milf did not want to be bound by our constitution
6921825 it is a consensus that the moa will be signed but the government has not yet given anyone the authority to sign the moa since wala pang there is no go signal from the government to sign the moa even if it has been signed it will not be binding
6921826 how many participated in the three plebiscites for inclusion in the armm dont you think that is enough consultation done by the government regarding the inclusion they have been consulted three times they said yes but are overwhelmed by the rest of the province

6921831 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6921832 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous

6921927 kmbc 9 news has every indication that barack obama is about to announce his running mate will be the indiana senator evan bayh this is based on sources very close to the situation and based also on this lets take a picture of this political piece that is been produced here at gill studios in lenexa kansas it says obama and or evan bayh on it i believe i actually dont have a monitor in front of me and gill studios is one of the leading manufacturers of political material in the nation they do more than 60 million worth of business they are non partisan they do stuff for the mccain campaign they do stuff for the obama campaign they do material for all sorts of political campaigns and initiatives throughout the nation they are very well respected organization when it comes to political literature our sources are telling me that the obama bayh pieces are going to be shipped to denver in anticipation of the denver democratic convention they may also end up showing up in springfield illinois tomorrow thats where we believe that the obama campaign will announce that it is evan bayh and is confirmed at least by the fact that this political piece is being manufactured here in gill studios in kansas city

6922090 first of all i keep getting off track every time i seem to get any information on what yall re up to something breaks in and the conversation gets sidetracked im getting fairly annoyed with that fact but suffice it to say ill keep an open channel for you from now at least until i see a reason otherwise i insist on you answering one simple question what is the signal being used for at least from your perspective i dont want the definition or an excuse i want to know in your words sal what is its purpose no b s
6922091 well if you insist on being so blunt ill be as forthcoming as i can the signal was initially used for
6922092 yes yes yes im aware that in the early days of the occupation the chips were put in place as a means of monitoring the slaves activities which is not what i asked you
6922093 you have no idea how much i want to reach through this screen and strangle you right now
6922094 sydney calm down sal is not aligned with the controlling body she is a rogue agent her communications are not sanctioned by the grc
6922095 the galactic regulatory council they are the ones in charge
6922096 youve got to be kidding it is all for entertainment thats what all the secrecy is about tens of thousands of years of occupation genetic manipulation slavery abductions wars death and our culture has been reduced to the galaxies little amusement park i find repulsive condescending and absolutely hilarious but in a weird way it makes perfect since sal if that is the case what is your roll that just bring out a whole but load of fucked up sense
6922097 im sure my cohorts will be able to fill you in on my roll i need to ask you something before we loose contact this facility you are in how were you able to reactivate it we have been looking for such a facility to use as a base of operation there on earth for thousands of years this particular facility alpha epsilon 4 was abandoned and lost over a hundred years ago we knew it existed but there were over three thousand of these scattered over the planet most were removed some were lost we had records of the locations of about thirty that still had functional ais however alpha epsilon 2 3 and 4 were deemed irrecoverably damaged the grcs records show this one located near devils tower wyoming how did it get to chicago
6922098 yall are really good at redirecting if i didnt know any better id say you were trying to manipulate me ill let that go for now i dont see any harm in showing my hand on this one i was able to activate this facility using a code key that i found in wyoming in 1973 while excavating a cave with a friend i met that was an abductee we were exploring a network of underground caverns and found using my chip detector a frequency in the upper em band that would allow us to pinpoint certain types of power distribution nodes buried deep within the earths crust about two miles down they were networked clear across the country and i later found around the world they conjoined in certain locations and had an interesting effect on the earths em field funny thing about it was that people for centuries called these conduits by the term lay lines and numerous spiritual belief systems across the world used these places as points of religious importance the most well known location of a nexus of these power lines is called stone hinge in england they can be used for much more than a place to prey if you know how to tap the energy you can use it as a means of transportation i took it upon my self to explore these underground caverns as often as i found them i was looking for just one of these facilities in chicago i managed to fake an entry code to this location as it was still on the grid i convinced it that it was alpha epsilon 4 in order to gain access dharma was the ai from alpha epsilon 4 i transferred her program using the lay lines to this facility alpha epsilon 2 it was a simple task really didnt take to much effort especially considering my friend was well aware of these facilities he is the one that lead me to them if it werent for everything i learned from him id still be mucking about in the desert looking for an entrance id love to say it was all my doing but i have to give credit where it is due
6922099 im getting an indication that i will be loosing my signal shortly thank you sydney for your honesty i think we will be able to work together to end this occupation tim please fill him in on our intentions and lorena see what you can do to locate and access alpha epsilon 3 signal gone in 3 2 1 end transmission
6922100 i regret to inform you we have experienced a power loss due to an unexpected em burst it has destabilized the core i suggest we brace for impact
6922101 impact what flair what the hell happened get these engines back on well if you cant get the core back up at least give me attitude control
6922102 you have attitude control ill see what i can do about the propulsion but in the mean time i suggest you look for a soft secluded place to land i will be busy for the next 29 5 seconds as i attempt to mask our decent we are already a ball of fire im sure we have been spotted
6922103 em i think we will be at ground level by the time we hit central oklahoma im attempting to find a soft place can you give me any help here at all em em
6922104 if you want to have any breaks you will leave me alone and look for a lake preferably in the middle of a very flat area in a rural town with an municipal airport
6922105 okay i think i have it we are looking for lake carl blackwell do you see it is that going to work i can guide us to it is there enough time to get us in under control
6922106 well lets just say we will be there in about 15 seconds and the engines are available in about 14
6922107 okay here it comes i need you to break as soon as the engines are up em breaks em
6922108 excuse me hey kingston trio over here i have something you might find interesting while you guys are trying to figure out weather or not you have a comet or a hunk of mars over there i tracked the ship to central oklahoma i have the ai online it appears that the mainframe has been off loaded but i have the entire database at hand here wanna take a look at the pilot
6922109 how the hell did you manage that let me see her
6922110 sydney you are quite the hacker i dont think i have ever seen anyone cut through code so easily how did you manage to get inside an alien ship so quickly especially a merkaba
6922111 well first of all they have the same brainwave patterns as an organic so it is just a simple matter of locating and manipulating the carrier wave and bouncing a quantum harmonic resonance amplifier off one of those jet airliner hulls that are constantly blanketing the planet with ions
6922112 okay sorry i asked did you have a point or do you just want to gloat over your find what do you have from the ai
6922113 oops sorry about that the ai appears to be attempting to repair the engines at the moment see over here the wave patterns are peaking at about 52 341 that is definitely an indication that it is damaged it must have taken a bad flair on the way in it appears to have offloaded the bulk of its active memory i dont see any indication that the pilot is on board let me access the exterior sensors sal can you punch up a merkaba schematic for me oh and lorena ill need you to monitor the military channels while we access it if they saw it im sure we dont want them to know we are hacking it
6922114 sydney if we can get our hands on that ship we could use it to
6922115 we cant afford to take chances like that not yet besides according to my data the ship is surrounded by hundreds of armed guards and at least a battalion of armored infantry it is mobile moving west on a flatbed looks like it is headed for the rockies besides it looks like its an old derelict model anyway i wouldnt trust that thing to float much less fly
6922116 jesus doesnt that lump have any concept of time alright im on my way
6922117 finally you both have to leave for chicago immediately i think i found a new leak it was after our last conversation when i lost my signal i was contacted by a man named sydney im not sure how you will find him but i have an image of him i am transmitting now he is not on the net
6922118 not on the net how is that possible sal i thought the grc had a number on ever soul alive or dead on this planet i dont understand
6922119 hun we have got to find this guy sal you said his name was sydney he is in chicago can you tell us how he made contact
6922120 yes chicago he apparently has been aware of the signal for some time i got an impression that he knows more than he let on it was as if he was testing me he told me he knew that aliens existed for a long time however i got an impression that he was not completely sane his speech was erratic and there was an air of nervousness about his line of questioning he was exceedingly suspicions especially of the fact that i speak english that led me to believe he does not know the nature of the signal he has tapped into
6922121 sal you didnt get a name or an address or anything on this guy
6922122 i dont care if you think this person is an agent or a human off the link we have to find him regardless of his involvement his linkup is not authorized by the grc and we need that technology you said that he pulled your signal hacked your hack so to speak if that is the case then you have tracked it dont you have some kind of resonant lock on the location check your data it has to be there somewhere
6922123 this may take some time i suggest you head for chicago now while i search for more information take the truck log back in tomorrow at this time i should have something for you by then im online now i have good signal so ill try to stay on as long as i can you have a lot of solar activity today itll strengthen my signal so i can stay for at least a few more hours if i can get through to this guy ill let stacey know hell contact you in rout
6922124 okay sal you got it were out stacey you keep the link up and call us as soon as you hear something or loose signal
6922125 the uh guy inside she uh well you need to when you get to your first campsite take a look at this
6922126 its okay stac we gotcha thanks well take care of it you go back inside im sure your needed
6922127 zack you have to hang on i can feel your pain i know it is difficult to focus
6922128 em i can hear you i dont know where they are holding me they have been at this for hours i think they are trying to force you out by torturing me dont let in you know how i am they wont break me they cant i have borne more pain than this i think my jaw has just about healed
6922129 we have to find a way out of here can you see anything in the room that would give you an indication of where you are in relation to the direction you are sensing me what is the color of the light outside your room through the cracks
6922130 primary propulsion online life support holding steady we have sustained minor hull damage we will not be able to launch from this position im taking on water we are currently submerged i will be able to repair the damage but it will take 2 weeks 21 hours and 19 minutes we are 15 feet below the surface of the lake i am monitoring local phone lines police channels airport tracking and military channels we as it stands were undetected well at least unreported as of yet our impact displaced a massive quantity of water and we have ignited a small forest fire scanning for life forms there is a single human male standing on the opposite shore he is currently throwing rocks in our general direction this accounts for the occasional pings you are hearing the stones are hitting our hull
6922131 well it is obvious he at least saw the impact i cant imagine what must be going through his mind switch to a monitoring channel and show me what he saw as we impacted
6922132 there seems to be some interference i am receiving no signal from him
6922133 what do you mean you cant tap him tell me what you do know did he see the impact show me the south bank of the lake as we descended from the time we entered the atmosphere till now tap a military satellite and show me what he was doing
6922134 can you find an angle that is not from the top
6922135 no we were on fire at the time and i was focused on keeping us from becoming a crater so this is what we have
6922136 okay i know you are watching me i assume you are at the bottom of the lake now ill be right down i suggest you get what ever you need ready to go im sure the police and military will be here soon enough if your ship survived the impact and can be repaired it would be advisable to get that damn ai onboard to start digging deep under the silt then download it i guarantee those pricks in the air force are gunna dredge the lake for it
6922137 excuse me sir how did you manage to gain entry
6922138 you people have been abducting me for the better part of 1500 years now and you dont think i would have picked up on a few tricks now and then seriously if you want to get out of here before the first chopper from bla bla air force base i suggest you open the inner seal and let me in
6922139 before you come in here would you mind telling me just what you are doing here
6922140 saving your ass from about 20 years of intensive and invasive research hey you look human were you surgically altered or chemically oh by the way im zak and you are get your shit my truck is waiting and we gotta get goin if we expect to cover our tracks
6922141 im ananona you can refer to the ai as em i was chemically altered we need to get out of here im downloading em to my deck you have transportation thank you zach the ship will dig into the silt after we leave and when we return it will dig itself out it should remain relatively safe till we get back
6922142 like i told you before i have been abducted for the last 1500 years on my last trip lets just say a little bird told me where to find you why exactly are you here i assume it has something to do with the signal
6922143 well i personally believe we are here to find you i had no idea you would be waiting for us when we arrived i calculated at least a month of searching databases its a good thing to with the botched landing we cannot remain concealed the ship will hopefully repair itself by the time we need it
6922144 okay download is complete em is online with me we can leave
6922145 so zach tell us how have you managed to stay hidden all these years from your government it couldnt have been easy you are not on the net who removed your implant
6922146 i was taken the first time when i was 18 the anuaki removed the implant on my first abduction
6922147 you better get this heap going those sirens are getting closer and that fire is lighting us up like a spotlight
6922148 right their intention i later learned was to see just how much data a human mind could hold they force fed me all kinds of information from star charts to pop tarts i learned a lot about this little galaxy and what yall are doing here on earth its a disgusting thing our government is doing cooperating with your people like they are
6922149 not my people we left that organization we have not be a part of that place since the dark ages
6922150 yeah right okay anyway keeping us from exploring the universe god i hate that spineless prick that runs it when i came back i lived in the desert out west for about 50 years while living there i was befriended by a rather odd fellow from tikarando maleirioza he to had been altered to look human he told me that i was unusual because of my genetic makeup the aging process could not be reversed i am now for all intense and purpose immortal it pissed me off ive jumped of bridges and found myself lying on a bank a few hours later ive been hung and drug behind a horse for hours electrocuted just to wake up with burns all over my body buried alive blown up and decapitated that one i thought would be the end of it i just grew a new head it took a painful 2 days hell ive died so many times i stopped counting my head is so full of information i dont even remember where i was born ive lived in every country and have visited at least a hundred planets the committee cannot hear me nor can they see what i see i plan on keeping it this way
6922151 see what in that crowd he could be any one of them
6922152 no i saw a black shadow run out of the alley in front of us speed up i can still see it moving ahead of us it looks like a person follow it it could be our guy
6922153 lorena it went straight through that door over there it is definitely a man i got a clear look at it when it stopped in front of the door i dont know if this is our guy but i gotta find out who or what this is
6922154 good lets get over there and into the warehouse weve been here for four days now and nothing even if its not him it is better than sitting in this truck another day i personally want to find out what that was if it is our guy ill bet he has some interesting things inside
6922155 i figured that was you sneaking down the road after me you two had better keep it low key around here if you know what is good for you
6922156 sydney is that you sal sent us weve been looking for you for days can we go somewhere and talk
6922157 well not here thats for sure come inside go to the back of the building ill open the door come inside and walk to the front it will be dark inside ill guide you i cant risk you knowing dont look at anything in fact once youre inside keep your eyes closed trust me or you will never speak to me again
6922158 uhm i appreciate the sentiment but you are squeezing the wrong hand take lorenas hand with your other im leading you dont forget to keep your eyes closed till i tell you to open them
6922159 okay you can speak freely now oh and open your eyes
6922160 what are you two doing chatting with that lump that calls itself sal youre supposed to be working for the government i have looked into your project youre not reporting to the government any findings you have been busy for the last couple of years appropriating funds covering your tracks building a fleet of those shadowy vans when i found your signal and subsequently tapped your wavelengths i learned quite a bit from your memories those freaky aliens cant even do that now what exactly is this grc hmmm
6922161 you know i could really use a hot cup of coffee
6922162 i know what youre thinking but at heart im really a geek
6922163 there are so many rooms here actually i dont think ive been in this one for months i usually eat in my bedroom well the room that has the bed anyway
6922164 no you dont have to worry about them seeing anything here ive made sure of that your brains are safe with me my mind isnt susceptible to the same kind of hacking yours are but i took certain precautions to ensure our privacy once i realized you would be coming here
6922165 how is it that you are not susceptible every human is and ill need some proof that we cannot be tapped before i continue with this dialogue
6922166 opps sorry about that i should have warned you ahead of time i guess about the room im not use to having visitors just be warned that a lot of things in my home will come as a surprise to you they are quite commonplace to me
6922167 thats quite alright sydney i think well cope now what was it you wanted to show us in here anyway
6922168 right the eeg machine tim may i call you tim or do you prefer doctor
6922169 tim is just fine the eeg machine what is the significance of it in regards to the signal
6922170 well then lets see lorena would you like to hook tim and i to the eegs
6922171 first of all youll notice that once you turn on the eegs you will see no brainwave patterns coming from either of us
6922172 no actually but that may just be that your machines are not functioning properly
6922173 no they are fine keep watching the read outs dharma deactivate the dampener
6922174 i can only keep it off while we arent talking if we are going to continue our conversations then we need to get those things out of your head the only problem is once they discover you are both off the net and your signals are deactivated you will bodies will be searched for and if not found within a month you will both become fugitives that wont give us much time do you trust me now you read the eeg do you need me to explain any further or can we start talking about this sal character
6922175 sydney all youve really shown us that you dont have any brain waves care to explain that id feel a little more comfortable if i knew how you were able to pull that off
6922176 jeez you are difficult to please lorena is he always like this
6922177 fine i had a little accident when i was a kid i sustained a severe head injury the back of my neck was impaled by a high voltage regulator that fried the device and pushed it out of my hippocampus toward the surface of my upper spinal cord i should be dead but the energy was absorbed by the device i could go more in depth but suffice it to say i fried it i was visiting relatives on vacation from mit for the summer and was out doing things any normal 10 year old would be doing you know climbing high voltage lines to in an attempt to charge an array of 350 drained automobile batteries to power a small laser i was working on well anyway i fell and when i woke up i ran into the house and removed the device with a pair of kitchen shears a painful experience i would not duplicate and when i got it out i became suddenly aware that it was not supposed to be there
6922178 take a look at what is in that pouch and tell me what you see

6922224 i just dont know why anyone would want to steal my identity im not rich or famous and work hard to earn every dime of my money this is terrible now i have to get new credit card numbers and email address and passwords
6922225 someone got my email address my passwords and my credit card information too they spent up all that i had on my cards spammed some websites and sent emails to my friends with pornography in them
6922226 how in the world did that happened exactly what happened did you get a virus on your computer or some malware you should have called me if you were having problems with your computer generally theyll act differently when something has been downloaded
6922227 well you know when those sign up forms ask for your email address
6922228 oh uh you put in your email password on the application website
6922229 yes i thought thats what they wanted anyway someone passed my email information to someone else and then they got into my email account
6922230 so how did they get your credit card info and other stuff like that
6922231 well i didnt store my passwords and account info in an encrypted file on my desktop you know the way you always recommend i just couldnt stop and pull up the file make up a code for the account and do all of that so i simply emailed my credit card and other account information to myself its way easier for me to open my email to get that info you know i really like the thunderbird email client that you recommended
6922232 oh so you put in your email password with your email address in an application for an online account for whatever it was then your email account got accessed and your identity got used is that what your telling me some jerk employee took advantage of you and now youre credit is on the run
6922233 yes most of it is being charged off but i had some very private stuff in my email and the porn stuff that got emailed out i dont even like porn

6922243 northstars achievements can be attributed to strong support from northstar corridor communities and dedicated officials including the minnesota department of transportation the metropolitan council and federal and state policymakers
6922244 with todays groundbreaking ceremony the journey to build northstar is one step closer to completion and the journey of tens of thousands of commuters is about to begin
6922245 more than ever the need for mass transit is glaringly apparent and this project has provided a unique opportunity to create jobs save commuters time and conserve energy i am proud i could play a role in moving this project through congress over the last six years and i look forward to witnessing the positive impact northstar will have on the lives of minnesotans our economy and the way we think about transportation
6922246 today is an exciting day for northstar supporters and all minnesotans who are seeking smart and affordable transportation alternatives
6922247 im happy to report that construction of the stations and other portions of the northstar project are on schedule and on budget so lets get ready to ride the line in 2009
6922248 northstar trains will provide a fast reliable and safe way for northern metro residents to connect to the twin cities
6922249 northstar will encourage future development in communities along its route including elk river in fact weve already started to see new business and community investments here that anticipate the arrival of northstar next year

6922469 first to destroy america turn america into a bilingual or multi lingual and bicultural country history shows that no nation can survive the tension conflict and antagonism of two or more competing languages and cultures it is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual however it is a curse for a society to be bilingual the historical scholar seymour lipset put it this way the histories of bilingual and bicultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil tension and lebanon all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy if not nigeria suppressed an ethnic rebellion france faces difficulties with basques bretons corsicans and muslims
6922470 third we could make the united states an hispanic quebec without much
6922471 i would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture i would replace the melting pot metaphor with the salad bowl metaphor it is important to ensure that we have various cultural subgroups living in america enforcing their differences rather than as americans emphasizing their similarities
6922472 fourth i would make our fastest growing demographic group the least educated i would add a second underclass unassimilated undereducated and antagonistic to our population i would have this second underclass have a from high school
6922473 my fifth point for destroying america would be to get big foundations and business to give these efforts lots of money i would invest in ethnic victimology i would get all minorities to think that their lack of success was the fault of the majority i would start a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority placation
6922474 my sixth plan for americas downfall would include and promote divided loyalties i would celebrate diversity over unity i would stress differences rather than similarities diverse people worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other that is when they are not killing each other a diverse peaceful or stable society is against most historical precident people undervalue the unity it takes to keep a nation ancient greeks the greeks believed that they belonged to the same race they possessed a common language and literature and they greece took part in the olympic games a common enemy persia threatened their liberty yet all these bonds were not strong enough to overcome two factors local patriotism and geographical e pluribus unum
6922475 next to last i would place all subjects off limits make it taboo to talk about anything against the cult of diversity i would find a word similar 16th century that stopped discussion and paralyzed thinking words like racist or xenophobe halt discussion and debate having made america a bilingual bicultural country having established multi culture having the large foundations fund the doctrine of victimology i would next make it impossible to enforce our i would develop a mantra that because immigration has been good for america it must always be good i would make every individual immigrant symmetric and ignore the cumulative impact of millions of them
6922476 regrettably in many cases the emphasis has changed from the desire to provide a needy child with a home to that of providing a needy parent with a child as a result a whole industry has grown generating millions of dollars of revenue each year
6922477 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
6922478 anyone who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without feminine upheaval social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex the ugly ones included
6922479 the individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe
6922480 the horrors of war pale beside the loss of a mother
6922481 she is 18 months we only just got her we were lucky we did
6922482 oh i dont know this one has been pretty tough she spent almost her entire first year with the birth mother the agency told me that was bad for her that is why she is so difficult for me it was wrong for her to spend that much time with her birth mother
6922483 stef sweetie we have to go i have to visit your brothers teacher and also drop paperwork off at the office
6922484 ditt cepe jag vill ha dig s j vla mycket
6922485 youre being arrested for exercising rights you thought you had but i guess you didnt have em didja
6922486 in the age of obama is street protest still relevant
6922487 a scripted and sanitized spectacle for a homogenous group of wealthy elites inside the convention hall versus a thriving organic movement of the masses outside
6922488 its to say to the whole country we are here
6922489 we plan to show that this is a crisis this is something that needs to be looked at with a little more urgency we dont have enough housing we dont have enough healthcare and its killing the people
6922490 democracy is not waiting to vote once every four years democracy is getting out in the streets
6922491 they the politicians are not gonna do it by themselves were gonna force their hand because that is the nature of democracy
6922492 especially now with a candidate who talks a lot about hope and change people talk about why do you need to protest
6922493 i think that we need to define what hope and change are we need to decide what that means to us as a people
6922494 for people who are disenfranchised by the system some of them for the first time are being motivated into politics
6922495 we want to create a broad progressive movement that can invite these newly politicized people in and we want to create a campaign that can take that beyond the voting booth
6922496 the story obama tells about how were gonna change this world by regular people taking action
6922497 creates more space for social movement organizing in a way we havent had since the 60s i would like to see the conventions and the protests around them take full advantage of that opportunity
6922498 use both conventions to put forward a narrative that we are starting a new chapter in american history our job is to be part of that progressive wave and to pull it to the left as much as we can
6922499 because obamas running they think weve got them theyre coming out theyre gonna support obama no matter what
6922500 some of us arent so sure that its gonna make a difference
6922501 the candidacy of obama is a reflection of the publics desire for something different
6922502 we believe that despite the rhetoric obama uses genuine change will always come from the bottom up and that means countering the system as a whole
6922503 people have learned that a top down approach to things doesnt work
6922504 what we have in common is a desire to break the spell that elections have over the us left
6922505 our message is one of direct participation in democracy bypassing corrupt politicians who dont represent us but instead further corporate interests
6922506 the rnc is a very easy target because they are so visibly to blame for whats happening in this country
6922507 theres a whole lot more energy for the rnc than the dnc
6922508 i dont know what to make of shutting down the rnc
6922509 id like to see more of a consciousness raising thing i dont want the left to be perceived as crazy
6922510 we know that it is the police not protesters or activists who will have the tasers guns rubber bullets concussion grenades chemical weapons helicopters the media spin machine and millions of dollars on their side
6922511 were just hoping that the denver police dont recreate the violence that happened in chicago in 68
6922512 recreate 68 at the 2008 dnc has become a point of contention all its own even among activists born decades after 1968 and bred amid a new world order
6922513 it provides inspiration and an example of what can be possible
6922514 but it can also prove a disservice if we just recreate 68 we will be destined to also recreate its problems
6922515 that culture of activist summit hopping im not really into that i do think it is important to show a resistance to both parties i just think that there are different ways that people go about doing that and i hope we dont lose steam over this election weve got a long way to go
6922516 is to get to work organizing where we are at our campuses workplaces and in our communities while at the same time building links with people struggling all around the world
6922517 we really need to find a way to engage the people who are excited and really do think that obamas gonna change something
6922518 we have to do a lot of popular education to say that it isnt politicians who make real change its the movements that politicians have to follow
6922519 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6922520 were going to try to go dark to the extent that the dc comics characters allow it
6922521 people fear death even more than pain its strange that they fear death life hurts a lot more than death at the point of death the pain is over
6922522 does you really think an animal would mind if it knew if it was going to a premier on the back of p diddy
6922523 i think that the animals would prefer to live their lives in the woods and die a natural death and probably dont know who p diddy is
6922524 yeah even i know who he is but im not a fox or a chinchilla
6922525 i want to create a video product for sale on the internet that will appeal to everybody everywhere
6922526 who holds sway us natives born rightwise to this fine land or the foreign hoards defiling it
6922527 everyone knows that rule number one for any job is showing up no private company would put up with its employees refusing to show up for work let alone watch the problem grow year after year these findings are an insult to the american taxpayer and should be of great concern to the agencies included and members of congress
6922528 it is inexcusable that federal agencies would sit by and let this problem get worse while some agencies are completely unaware that there even is a problem before agencies come hat in hand to congress asking for money to hire more employees they should fully use the ones they already have by getting the awol problem under control awol employees put a hidden tax on the american taxpayer by making the federal government more inefficient with the resources it has been given
6922529 half of its a rock opera you know paul oneill is famous for his rock opera and the other half is instrumental its called nightcastle and we are in the final recording stages were scheduled to mix the album august 10th so right now al pitrelli is down here in florida with me and every night we are down here doing the final guitar tracks and solo tracks its great its a brilliant record its taken two and a half years to do but i think that once people hear it they are going to be quite surprised its got some great material that in my opinion is the best yet that i have done with tso im looking forward to it its got some really great songs that should be out by christmas hope

6922532 when i made the woman she had to be special gt gt gt gt i made her shoulders strong enough to carry the weight of the world gt gt gt gt yet gentle enough to give comfort gt gt gt gt i gave her an inner strength to endure childbirth and the rejection that many times comes from her children gt gt gt gt i gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going when everyone else gives up and take care of her family through sickness and fatigue without complaining gt gt gt gt i gave her the sensitivity to love her children under any and all circumstances even when her child has hurt her very badly gt gt gt gt i gave her strength to carry her husband through his faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his heart gt gt gt gt i gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never hurts his wife but sometimes tests her strengths and her resolve to stand beside him unfalteringly gt gt gt gt and finally i gave her a tear to shed this is hers exclusively to use whenever it is needed
6922533 the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears the figure that she carries or the way she combs her hair gt gt gt gt the beauty of a woman must be seen in her eyes because that is the doorway to her heart the place where love resides

6922584 april 4th 1984 last night to the flicks all war films one very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterranean audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water audience shouting with laughter when he sank
6922585 do you begin to see then what kind of world we are creating it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined a world of fear and treachery and torment a world of trampling and being trampled upon a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself progress in our world will be progress toward more pain
6922586 there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment how often or on what system the thought police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to you had to live did live from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard and except in darkness every movement scrutinized
6922587 from where winston stood it was just possible to read picked out on its white face in elegant lettering the three slogans of the party war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
6922588 never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling everything will be dead inside you never again will you be capable of love or friendship or joy of living or laughter or curiosity or courage or integrity you will be hollow we shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves
6922589 the party seeks power entirely for its own sake we are not interested in the good of others we are interested solely in power not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness only power pure power what pure power means you will understand presently we are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing all the others even those who resembled ourselves were cowards and hypocrites the german nazis and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives they pretended perhaps they even believed that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal we are not like that we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it power is not a means it is an end one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship the object of persecution is persecution the object of torture is torture the object of power is power
6922590 we are not content with negative obedience nor even with the most abject submission when finally you surrender to us it must be of your own free will we do not destroy the heretic because he resists us so long as he resists us we never destroy him we convert him we capture his inner mind we reshape him we burn all evil and all illusion out of him we bring him over to our side not in appearance but genuinely heart and soul we make him one of ourselves before we kill him it is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world however secret and powerless it may be even in the instance of death we cannot permit any deviation we make the brain perfect before we blow it out
6922591 the ideal set up by the party was something huge terrible and glittering a world of steel and concrete of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons a nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually working fighting triumphing persecuting three hundred million people all with the same face
6922592 a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness a desire to kill to torture to smash faces in with a sledge hammer seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current turning one even against ones will into a grimacing screaming lunatic and yet the rage that one felt was an abstract undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp
6922593 we shall abolish the orgasm our neurologists are at work upon it now there will be no loyalty except loyalty towards the party there will be no love except the love of big brother there will be no laughter except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy there will be no art no literature no science when we are omnipotent there will be no need of science there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness there will be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life all competing pleasures will be destroyed but always do not forget this winston always there will be the intoxication of power constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever
6922594 most of the time when people go to get read they know what theyre going to hear already even if they dont know that they do

6922678 cut and run john murtha is in charge of the appropriations committee for defense and he is certainly no friend of the military
6922679 and dont talk to me about him being an ex marine lord that was 40 years ago a lot of stuff can happen in 40 years thank you for your service as being an ex marine but that doesnt mean youre not an idiot and he is
6922680 congressman murthas record of supporting our troops and our veterans speaks for itself
6922681 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord
6922682 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain
6922683 now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain
6922684 but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end
6922685 f or we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation
6922686 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it
6922687 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
6922688 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul
6922689 for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation
6922690 as one who sins repeatedly but keeps getting back up to live for god
6922691 for a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again
6922692 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance
6922693 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
6922694 brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins
6922695 james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting
6922696 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves
6922697 every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
6922698 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad
6922699 whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him
6922700 this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh
6922701 and the lord said who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season
6922702 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
6922703 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him
6922704 because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it
6922705 worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly
6922706 of continued obedience to god then salvation is a process
6922707 now the parable is this the seed is the word of god
6922708 for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law christ is become of no effect unto you
6922709 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live
6922710 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth
6922711 the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness
6922712 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
6922713 for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning
6922714 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all
6922715 romans 10 12 if that harelips every dog in the county i dont care the bible teaches that a mans faith is counted for righteousness romans 4 5 22 i am not condoning sin not at all believers who sin will be dealt with accordingly at the
6922716 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee save thyself
6922717 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence
6922718 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
6922719 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times
6922720 and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul am made a minister carefully notice what colossians 1 20 says
6922721 this scripture must be reconciled with all others ephesians 2 8 9 plainly teaches that mankind has nothing to do with salvation it is of god
6922722 assuming indeed that you are adhering to your faith having been placed upon a foundation with the present result that you are on that foundation firmly established and that you are not continually being shifted away from your hope held out by the gospel which you heard that gospel which was proclaimed in all creation which is under heaven of which i paul became one who ministers
6922723 pauls point is that we have been reconciled it is an accomplished fact so if you are a child of god today you will continue in the faith grounded and settled you will not be moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard
6922724 therefore i endure all things for the elects sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory
6922725 clearly this has nothing to do with losing salvation but rather the unsaved this passage of scripture speaks of those who have rejected jesus christ peter denied jesus 3 times but he didnt lose his salvation the issue is not losing salvation but rather have you been saved at all
6922726 ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men
6922727 but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live
6922728 therefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth
6922729 this is the heart of the matter here god is simply condemning self righteousness the new testament states in romans 10 3 4
6922730 for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
6922731 but secretly so for fear of being persecuted john 12 42 all of jesus disciples forsook him prior to the cross

6922750 thi s paper has explored the effects of television and in particular of programs such as soap operas on womens fertility our analysis draws on the experience of brazil a country where soap opera watching is ubiquitous and cuts across social classes we exploit differences in the timing of entry into different markets of rede globo which until the early 1990s had an effective monopoly on novelas production in brazil to estimate the impact of globo availability on 22 fertility choices we find that after controlling for time varying controls and for time invariant area characteristics the presence of the globo signal leads to significantly lower fertility this effect is stronger for women of low socioeconomic status as measured by education or durable goods ownership the effect is also stronger for women who are in the middle and late phases of their childbearing life suggesting that television contributed more to stopping behavior than to delayed first births consistently with demographic patterns documented for brazil finally suggestive evidence in the last part of the paper indicates that the results may be interpreted not only in terms of exposure to television but also of exposure to the particular reality portrayed by brazilian novelas our findings have important policy implications for todays developing countries

6922997 i think id rather have my dog have my dog have me try to rescue her than try to eat a puppy
6922998 from the time we were introduced to the puppies to the time we actually started the competition it was about three hours it was about 105 degrees that day in the beginning when bella saw the puppies she went darting toward them she was so excited three hours later she could care less it was so hot no dog wanted to be out there presley got overheated star got overheated
6922999 im so short i couldnt see where she was at all and it was very hard to navigate her and where she was
6923000 soulmate shes part of everything i do shes my muse and my mentor she inspires me daily i dont know where id be in my life without her we rescued each other shes my world
6923001 im funny and goofy but im not a total spaz like that they the producers wanted to make a character i get it
6923002 i take better care of bella than i do myself
6923003 i would hope every person in america reading this would do the same for their dogs because health and nutrition is so important and people take that for granted
6923004 it was completely premeditated on her part to go out there and throw me under the bus
6923005 in no way shape or form was i hurting my dog whatsoever
6923006 those yelps were voiceover yelps thats not even how my dog yelps so they were trying to make a story about it
6923007 some of the best trick dogs on that show sometimes just said im just going to sit here and not listen to you right now
6923008 ive completely come around and i understand the nuances of dogs
6923009 i guess it was our time to go painting was definitely not our thing i dont know how that relates to being the greatest dog
6923010 they were trying to really encourage us to teach our dogs these new things that were so foreign to them in such a short amount of time and he was exhausted
6923011 i went there to have a good time with preston and escape my crazy life in show business
6923012 i really was focused on making the experience fun for him i was so fortunate to have 40 days to hang out with my best friend preston
6923013 to be able to wake up every day and not have to think of anything but is my dog happy and today i get to play with my dog and 11 other incredible animals was just such a joy and i feel so lucky to have that opportunity
6923014 it was difficult to keep some sense of normalcy for your dog and make sure they stayed on their normal feeding schedule
6923015 finding the balance between work and rest and play was really important to me
6923016 is a very thoughtful good human being who has become a very dear friend of mine since we first went on this journey together
6923017 the fact that travis and i are both in los angeles were both in the industry and our dogs both adore each other we had so much fun together
6923018 travis and i are getting to know each other were very close we went to the dog museum the other day we took our dogs surfing we went to a dodgers game and caught a foul ball
6923019 i cant say that were dating but were definitely close
6923020 i felt bad the way it was cut together made it seem like there was a big thing between the two of us everybody had noticed bella had cried out of course she knows her own dog so if she says shes working through her issues its not my position to judge i wasnt the only one who said something to the judges its just the way the show was cut they really tried to play up travis and my alleged showmance and have some big traumatic ending like we hated each other
6923021 my fiance is the stern dad who she likes to play with all the time its unfortunate he couldnt be on the show with us because she listens to everything he says she just likes to be a little brat to me
6923022 when we got home you should have seen how her face lit up
6923023 but shes definitely going to be in all the pictures its going to be beacons day too
6923024 its like having a little child im the mother and hes the father and shes the baby were just a happy family
6923025 i couldnt understand why one of my friends was talking to someone we werent supposed to like
6923026 as far as the other two go i really dont care what they say a lot of things they said to me was the total opposite of everything my trainers have told me like manipulating my dog to sit
6923027 shes really mean shes just conniving and evil thats what i personally think im glad im not in the house any more to have to deal with that i dont even see the need to ever talk to her again she claims she is the

6923516 that is not true the mayor wrote to me on may 28 requesting for a site he gave me three months which means by august 28 i should be able to give him a site but it was not up to august 20 he went ahead and announced that we have not provided a site i think i still have about two weeks to provide a site for the market and i am confident that before the deadline i will have a site for the market
6923517 right now the present mayor wants to relocate it out of great soppo if they are going to move the market from the present site for whatever reason we shall go back to the former site and build our small daily great soppo womens market
6923518 that will be fine but as at now i cannot rule out the relocation until he provides the site

6923534 according to our statistics by 2009 we should see the baby boomers start to die off in large numbers heart attacks strokes cancer kidney failure you name it the boomers are going to be dropping from it
6923535 before long tens of millions of members of this irritating generation will achieve what such boomer icons as jim morrison janis joplin timothy leary and john kennedy already have death before long we will live in a glorious new world in which no one will ever again have to endure tales of joan baezs performance at woodstock
6923536 our nation must steel itself for one vast final orgy of boomer self obsession as we are hit with a bewildering onslaught of magazine pictorials hardcover coffee table books and multi part motown soundtracked television specials looking back on the glory days of the 1960s
6923537 but once this great final spasm of nostalgia passes the ravages of age will take its toll on boomer self indulgence and the curtain will at long last fall on what is regarded by many as the most odious generation america has ever produced
6923538 the selfishness that has been a hallmark of the boomers will continue right up to the very end as they force millions of younger americans to devote an inordinate amount of time and resources to their care bankrupting the social security system in the process
6923539 in their old age the boomers will actually manage to take as much from the next generation as they did the previous one which fought wwii so that their boomer children could have philco tvs and davy crockett air rifles
6923540 its not exactly clear how but for the past 40 years this generation has managed to keep the spotlight on itself
6923541 the era defining flower children of the 60s hedonistic disco goers of the 70s bmw driving yuppies of the 80s and graying private investor homeowner parents of the 90s all have one thing in common theyre all boomers

6923551 the panel of trial judges was improperly composed as it included his lordship justice martin mbeng a judge regularly appointed and serving in the court of appeal
6923552 that a trial court had no jurisdiction to hear the matter as the court was composed of a judge from the southwest court of appeal and judges not appointed to the meme high court
6923553 that the learned judges convicted and sentenced the appellant ayuk on circumstantial evidence which was plagued with discrepancies and previous testimonies based on the evidence of pw1 pw2 pw13 and pw14
6923554 to have failed to do so pendente lite before the meme high court and raise it now on appeal was at best an ambush and at its worst patent bad faith
6923555 ar te no 55 s johnson ayuks counsel had properly played their legal trump card
6923556 we therefore consider it incumbent on us to grant the appellant bail pending when the legal department shall decide to prosecute the matter de novo this accordingly granted bail in the sum of fcfa 5 000 000 and two sureties in like sum

6923564 alc is out to detect the african intellect and put them into a network whereby they can help one another to make a difference for the interest of the african continent so our mission is to unleash the potential of those african leaders who are really willing to make meaningful contributions to the development of our continent
6923565 we in the findings also try to see if the studies offered in the school in question reflect the need in africa if we are satisfied we approach the school to work out a partnership in a bid to facilitate the admission of interested africans across the continent
6923566 what we are doing with alc is just our modest way of trying to make a difference for this our beloved continent each african has a responsibility to work in his own modest way for the development of this continent
6923567 do not ask what your country has done for you but rather ask what you have done for your country
6923568 this is exactly what we are doing with alc africans trying to do something for africa
6923569 with alc we humbly believe that we are moving towards a new beginning in africa where all of us need to understand that it is imperative for us to reinvent ourselves in order to better position ourselves in this world of globalisation with alc we are building a connection among ourselves for the development of africa
6923570 regardless of your situation you can transcend barriers and project yourself and your future in order to realise your own goal if you believe in the change that you believe is good for you
6923571 the african people should discard inferiority complex believe in themselves and take their own destiny into their own hands

6923591 did you know that there is an open practice on monday
6923592 i dont care what time it is i am going hell yeah
6923593 wait where is it at at the stadium or at the rugby field or will they be in the everest
6923594 god experienced the events of the world he has created as they happen rather than all at once in some timeless eternal perception this also means that not even god knows the future in all its details
6923595 present dispositions proclivities inclinations intentions and probabilities as well as they can be known
6923596 god does not need us or the rest of creation for anything yet we and the rest of creation can glorify him and bring him joy
6923597 god is unchanging in his being perfections purposes and promises yet god does act and feel emotions and he acts and feels differently in response to different situations
6923598 open to new experiences has a capacity for novelty and is open to reality which itself is open to change
6923599 god is immutable in essence and in his trustworthiness over time but in other respects god changes
6923600 god has no beginning end or succession of moments in his own being and he sees all time equally vividly yet god sees events in time and acts in time
6923601 god does not have size or spatial dimensions and is present at every point of space with his whole being yet god acts differently in different places
6923602 i do not feel obliged to assume that god is a purely spiritual being when his self revelation does not suggest it the only persons we encounter are embodied persons and if god is not embodied it may prove difficult to understand how god is a person embodiment may be the way in which the transcendent god is able to be immanent and why god is presented in such terms
6923603 god is not divided into parts yet we see different attributes of god emphasized at different time
6923604 the doctrine of divine simplicity so crucial to the classical understanding of god has been abandoned by a strong majority of christian philosophers through it still has a small band of defenders
6923605 let us not treat the attributes of god independently of the bible but view the biblical metaphors as reality depicting descriptions of the living god whose very being is self giving love
6923606 gods omnipotence means that god is able to do all his holy will
6923607 we must not define omnipotence as the power to determine everything but rather as the power that enables god to deal with any situation that arises
6923608 god cannot just do anything he wants when he wants to his power can at least temporarily be blocked and his will not be done in the short term
6923609 until the time of the socinians the belief that gods omniscience included all future events was not generally questioned
6923610 since then there is not reason no passage of scripture from which it can be clearly gathered that god knew all things which happened before they happened we must conclude that we are by no means to assent such a foreknowledge of god
6923611 god cant foreknow the good or bad decisions of the people he creates until he created these people and they in turn create their decisions
6923612 from plato aristotle and the subsequent hellenistic tradition the church arrived at the notion that god was altogether unmoved impassible immutable nontemporal and purely actual
6923613 it is true that medieval theologians were aware of the teaching of certain greek philosophers in discussing gods immutability they noted platos argument that change in a supremely perfect being constitutes corruption deterioration and loss of perfection the fact is however that the hebrew christian belief in gods immutability arose independently of greek philosophy it stemmed from revelational sources rather than from speculative conjecture
6923614 they quoted the new testament alone more than thirty six thousand times omitting from all reference only eleven verses
6923615 impressive philosophical evidence supports the open view of god and reality
6923616 we are always to make a discriminating use of sound hermeneutical principles we must not study them in the light of modern systems of divinity but should aim rather to place ourselves in the position of the sacred writers and study to obtain the impression their words would naturally have made upon the minds of the first readers still less should we allow ourselves to be influenced by any presumptions of what the scriptures ought to teach
6923617 in terms of biblical interpretation i give particular weight to narrative and the language of personal relationships in it the biblical
6923618 i would propose that the general rule to be followed is that the teachings about what god is like should be the explanation of what he appears to be doing in a given situation
6923619 from a christian perspective love is the first and last word in the biblical portrait of god the statement god is love is as close as the bible comes to giving us a definition of the divine reality
6923620 consequently when we enumerate gods qualities we must not only include love to be faithful to the bible we must put love at the head of the list
6923621 a doctrine of god that is faithful to the bible must show that all of gods characteristics derive from love
6923622 to attribute supreme love to god therefore we should think of him as supremely responsive to the experiences of his creatures
6923623 this technique seeks a larger picture in a passage before investigating the details in fact it disparages traditional methods that investigate the details first before proceeding to the larger picture
6923624 the lord was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth and it grieved him to his heart
6923625 god changed his mind about saul but this was not gods ideal will he did it as a necessary and just response to sauls own free decisions it seems clear that if god can hope for one outcome only to be disappointed by another it must be possible for humans to thwart his will in some instances
6923626 verse 11 does not intend to suggest yahwehs fickleness of purpose but his sorrow over sin it does not depict yahweh flustered over lack of foresight but yahweh grieved over lack of obedience we need to know that the god of the bible is no cold slab of concrete impervious to our carefully defended apostasies
6923627 is it possible for god to have mistaken beliefs about the future the traditional theological answer is that god cannot but there are several biblical texts that seem to affirm that what god thought would happen did not come about
6923628 how long will this people spurn me and how long will they not believe in me despite all the signs which i have performed in their midst
6923629 they have built the high places of topheth which is in the valley of the son of hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire which i did not command and it did not come into my mind
6923630 so many details involving future free choices with such precision this is truly overwhelming evidence in one chapter of the bible of the reality of gods foreknowledge 84
6923631 the promises of god should be understood as part of the divine project rather than as some eternal blueprint a project in which god has not scripted the way everything in human history will go god has a goal but the routes remain open
6923632 while the word foreknow means much more than bare pre knowledge in romans 8 29 it cannot mean anything less the use of the word whom instead of what means that it is not faith that is foreknown but the people of god the elect
6923633 next to the central doctrines of the christian faith the issue of whether the future is exhaustively settled or partially open is relatively unimportant
6923634 there is nothing specifically said in the old testament that would have led one to predict a dying and raised messiah
6923635 at the incarnation god undertook the risk that his son would fail in his struggle with temptation
6923636 but god made the earth by his power he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding
6923637 entrust their souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right
6923638 god is yet working to fulfill his promises and bring his project to fruition the eschaton will surprise us because it is not set in concrete it is not unfolding according to a prescribed script
6923639 our prayers make a difference to god because of the personal relationship god enters into with us god chooses to make himself dependent on us for certain things

6923672 all laws which are repugnant to the constitution are null and void
6923673 where rights secured by the constitution are involved there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them
6923674 an unconstitutional act is not law it confers no rights it imposes no duties affords no protection it creates no office it is in legal contemplation as inoperative as though it had never been passed
6923675 i preside over the greatest collection of integrity and idealism
6923676 people voted for change and they voted for democrats who will take our country in a new direction
6923677 the public doesnt want to know about process and 60 votes they want outcomes they want results
6923678 whether its the deficit or the challenges to the constitution we have to dig our way out
6923679 this election is like death for life on this planet as we know it today

6923694 several bidders kept pushing up the price when our staff contacted them the price dropped
6923695 use gods word the sword of the spirit by speaking
6923696 our fight is not with people but our fight is with the evil spirits aka the kingdom of darkness
6923697 you are a wnner aka a holy nation a royal kingly priesthood a peculiar people who live by faith in gods word and not by your natural senses

6923712 mientras m s cuentos de amor leo me doy cuenta que menos amor hay en mi vida

6923714 pensavo che la basilicata fosse uninvenzione della mia maestra delle elementari
6923715 completes a pattern of hyped one sided reportage that goes back a while
6923716 stai scrivendo una storia che parla di noi e che magari parla di me
6923717 e vero sto scrindo qualcosa di te tuttavia pi importante delle parole la matita con la quale scrivo vorrei che la usassi tu quando sarai cresciuto
6923718 ma uguale a tutte le altre matite che ho visto nella mia vita
6923719 dipende tutto dal modo in cui guardi le cose questa matita possiede cinque qualit se riuscirai a trasportarle nellesistenza sarai sempre una persona in pace col mondo
6923720 prima qualit puoi fare grandi cose ma non devi mai dimenticare che esiste una mano che guida i tuoi passi dio ecco come si chiama questa mano egli deve condurti sempre verso la sua volont
6923721 seconda qualit di tanto in tanto devo interrompere la scrittura e usare il temperino e unazione che provoca una certa sofferenza alla matita ma alla fine essa risulta pi appuntita ecco perch devi imparare a sopportare alcuni dolori ti faranno diventare un uomo migliore
6923722 terza qualit il tratto della matita ci permette di usare una gomma per cancellare ci che sbagliato correggere unazione o un comportamento non necessariamente qualcosa di negativo anzi importante per riuscire a mantenere la retta via della giustizia
6923723 quarta qualit ci che realmente importante della matita non il legno o la sua forma esteriore bens la grafite della mina racchiusa in essa dunque presta sempre attenzione a ci che accade dentro di te
6923724 ecco la quinta qualit della matita essa lascia sempre un segno allo stesso modo tutto ci che farai nella vita lascer sempre una traccia di conseguenza impegnati per avere sempre coscienza di ogni tua azione
6923725 il cammino delluomo timorato minacciato da ogni parte dalle iniquit degli esseri egoisti e dalla tirannia degli uomini malvagi benedetto sia colui che nel nome della carit e della buona volont conduce i deboli attraverso la valle delle tenebre perch egli in verit il pastore di suo fratello e il ricercatore dei figli smarriti e la mia giustizia caler sopra di loro con grandissima vendetta e furiosissimo sdegno su coloro che si proveranno ad ammorbare ed infine a distruggere i miei fratelli e tu saprai che il mio nome quello del signore quando far calare la mia vendetta sopra di te
6923726 the average embedded system device continues to require greater amounts of software to serve the requirements of both suppliers and end users among many other functions todays embedded systems demand more sophisticated system interfaces incorporating increasingly complex graphical elements as well as advanced wired and wireless communication capabilities
6923727 as a result of a greater overall focus on software as means to enable increased functionality a large number of embedded systems manufacturers are currently dedicating more of their resources to software engineering tasks
6923728 i just thought he was obviously a good football coach but also a very good communicator
6923729 i thought he had a good way about him he was bright eyed he had a great sense of humor a good laugh he wasnt stiff he was a guy that you knew related well to his players
6923730 its an exciting trip for me i have some good friends there
6923731 although i wasnt there a great deal of time it felt good to be a part of what we were building there i thought it was going to be potentially special i root for those guys because theyre close and personal friends of mine it will be professionalism of course on saturday night but it will be great to see them all players coaches front office people
6923732 he was my first defensive coordinator in the pros while he was here he taught me a whole lot and im still playing by some of his rules now
6923733 its going to be a joy to go out there and play in front of him and just to show off a little bit how far ive come
6923734 mike did a great job here and had a tremendous relationship with the players
6923735 just seeing him work with our defense and the way they came around in such a short period of time i was very impressed with what he did
6923736 he knew how to communicate with everybody and that was very big on my part
6923737 he always talked about being the best at what he does definitely going up to being a head coach and taking that next step and being the best is what hes trying to do
6923738 im sure well have a lot of conversations that will be going back and forth he knows us better than maybe we know ourselves because he sat there and watched every day in practice and meetings and watched our every move he knows our strengths he knows our weaknesses but when it comes to playing a game a lot of it doesnt matter it all comes down to who executes
6923739 our place is located right where those five lines come down the mountain
6923740 but you said the cabin was right where five lions come down
6923741 they think that they are going to stay in georgia breaking this the ceasefire accord
6923742 they are talking about staying in south ossetia and abkhazia even making more stations around some buffer zones and this kind of thing which is absolutely not with this peace accord
6923743 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6923744 but if thats what the people want im not going to waste a bunch of time and fight it
6923745 he said are you working do you need a ride and she was like no and he pulled out the gun and shot her in the chest
6923746 as long as i committed a crime in their presence their trust went up
6923747 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6923748 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6923749 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
6923750 ive never seen a homeless guy with a bottle of gatorade
6923751 this is the olympic games the two best teams in the world as far as i see it and this is what we wanted and this is the way we want to win the gold medal
6923752 thats their style and thats the way they play i dont think we back down from that in any way shape or form
6923753 and well be there again all of us being physical and all of us out there and you know thats to be expected
6923754 im not sure that they ever showed their real personalities
6923755 i think last season the talent was great and the ratings were great i just think it could be more interesting and controversial
6923756 for me to deny there was friction between dena and ed would be a lie
6923757 there was friction and thats not a good thing for a network to perceive its not a good thing for the cast and crew and its not a good thing for the owner of the show to see
6923758 you put it in the freezer for a few weeks so the liquid becomes real thick
6923759 and then the way you work the shark you cant describe it but it smells awful
6923760 but you have to do it thats just the way it is
6923761 it gives you anguish yes basically existentialism is to say it doesnt matter whether god lives or he doesnt you create your own life and by doing that you make an example for others
6923762 its not so much a matter of believing in the regular sense of the word its more of enjoying the possibility of it actually existing
6923763 and it doesnt matter whether somebody judges you or not for having that possibility in your mind because its a funny possibility and it enlightens your life and makes it more colorful
6923764 they are from connecticut and it just feels like home i was feeling nostalgic so i decided i was only going to listen to 80s music i am a 80s music nut i love it i do love the 70s also but i was thinking it was a day for some 80s pop music
6923765 yeah i am sure that is what the people in that spain plane were saying as they took off down the runway in a ball of fire

6923774 and thats another thing barry is really hurting about the way youre treating him hes seriously thinking of abandoning ship to the music pod completely and then we really are in trouble you know how many times ive convinced him to stay on the show
6923775 you know its not its the uselessness of it all how is our talking making the game any better for anyone what new information are we introducing to the listening public
6923776 i dont know but i do know that you and barry arent going anywhere youve both got quite a reputation now around town thanks to sean and i if you left things could get a lot worse your setanta job could evaporate in a matter of weeks

6923779 am i you know the guardian james you dont need to be mad to work here etcetera etcetera
6923780 i cant wait to show you the trophy it is the most precious thing and the highest acknowledgment of my work i could receive
6923781 its very hard to make it but kevin is one of the few who really broke through the pretty girls were falling for him and everybody wanted to hear what he had to say
6923782 the pain of life overrides the joy to the point that joy does not exist
6923783 sayap ini melambangkan kebebasan dan keunikan seseorang itu kita boleh bebas jika tiada masalah dan keunikan seseorang itu dapat menjadikan orang itu terkenal dan dihormati orang jadi jika kita mahu kebebasan kita harus berusaha jangan juga mensia siakan keunikan kita dan apabila terkenal nanti jangan lupa diri dan menjadi sombong kerana kita akan kehilangan rasa hormat

6923823 work no 850 centres on a simple idea that a person will run as fast as they can every thirty seconds through the gallery each run is followed by an equivalent pause like a musical rest during which the grand neoclassical gallery is empty this work celebrates physicality and the human spirit creed has instructed the runners to sprint as if their lives depended on it bringing together people from different backgrounds from all over london work no 850 presents the beauty of human movement in its purest form a recurring yet infinitely variable line drawn between two points
6923824 i believe that this will be the largest multiday ticketed event in the history of san francisco
6923825 we have people coming to this festival from all over the united states and the world
6923826 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
6923827 i think people were calling up my parents and trying to figure out whats going on and all of a sudden theyre getting all these phone calls
6923828 of course they have their own opinions but you can never take a tabloid seriously if they werent supportive they wouldnt come to all the shows people like to make games out of other peoples lives
6923829 i dont think you need to be one way or another to try something and its a song about curiosity of course some people dont like it but to each is own i dont like stuff they do
6923830 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
6923831 i think people were calling up my parents and trying to figure out whats going on and all of a sudden theyre getting all these phone calls
6923832 of course they have their own opinions but you can never take a tabloid seriously if they werent supportive they wouldnt come to all the shows people like to make games out of other peoples lives
6923833 i dont think you need to be one way or another to try something and its a song about curiosity of course some people dont like it but to each is own i dont like stuff they do
6923834 katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
6923835 i think people were calling up my parents and trying to figure out whats going on and all of a sudden theyre getting all these phone calls
6923836 of course they have their own opinions but you can never take a tabloid seriously if they werent supportive they wouldnt come to all the shows people like to make games out of other peoples lives
6923837 i dont think you need to be one way or another to try something and its a song about curiosity of course some people dont like it but to each is own i dont like stuff they do
6923838 but now its been more constructed its just going to be called j o n a s and is going to be us dealing with trying to take out the trash and not get hounded by fans its going to be a funny show
6923839 true communication is possible only between equals because inferiors are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies than for telling the truth a central tenet of discordianism often invoked by hackers to explain why authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically the effect of the s n a f u principle is a progressive disconnection of decision makers from reality
6923840 the fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt
6923841 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
6923842 the important thing in writing is the capacity to astonish not shock shock is a worn out word but astonish
6923843 the caller will try to convince you that you can avoid defaulting on your loan by sending the payment to their processing center immediately
6923844 this is an old scam and unfortunately it is still used today
6923845 the poor person today is the oppressed one the one marginated from society the member of the proletariat struggling for the most basic rights the exploited and plundered social class the country struggling for its liberation in todays world the solidarity and protest of which we are speaking have an evident and inevitable political character insofar as they imply liberation to be with the oppressed is to be against the oppressor
6923846 the protest of which we are speaking have an inevitable political character to be with the oppressed is to be against the oppressor
6923847 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
6923848 the message is for a kid from in marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
6923849 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
6923850 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
6923851 we really want change we really need it its not the same no more
6923852 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
6923853 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
6923854 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
6923855 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
6923856 the most problematic hip hop gets 90 percent of the coverage in the non music press
6923857 hip hop is associated in so many peoples minds with crime drugs and misogyny so obamas faced with a constellation of problematic images the question is how do you send a message that doesnt wind up demonizing somebody
6923858 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
6923859 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
6923860 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big
6923861 during this election young people from all walks of life have responded to senator obamas message of hope and change for the future with great enthusiasm
6923862 and that includes those in the hip hop community individuals who are talented intelligent and entrepreneurial in spirit but who in the past have felt that government and politics dont really work for them
6923863 senator obama wants to engage the hip hop community more in the political process because issues including education jobs and health care are as important to this generation as any other we will be talking to the hip hop community more throughout this campaign and letting them know they have reason to put their trust in senator obama because he will work to fundamentally change their lives
6923864 the hip hop experience is for some the black experience and the campaign has been very inclusive and has been one that has welcomed voices from all over the country
6923865 with the hip hop community its been an interesting conversation because on the one hand we know the hip hop community has reflected a great deal of whats been happening in our inner cities for a long time and the systemic challenges that face that community senator obama has a plan as part of his overall call for change that will address those challenges the voice of the hip hop community will be reflected in this campaign with senator obamas plan for inner city communities
6923866 these situations are a case by case basis when and where and timing
6923867 the hip hop community has clearly embraced senator obama and they see him as someone who can effect change in a dramatic way the key with us as we go through the next few months is identifying opportunities where we can work together to communicate the senators message
6923868 i thought about hip hop associations harming obamas chances i really did
6923869 so in the concert i always say this is not sponsored by obama i make it very clear to say that cause i know obama associated with this guy from f in marcy projects i know thats coming any day i think about that often i mean what do you do what do i do i have to support the guy but i dont wanna hurt him i aint like the preachers and all those guys i dont wanna make the inappropriate statements and keep going im the guy that will fall back
6923870 you gotta speak what you feel you gotta be respectful though
6923871 like anything you do you cant come to anybodys show and be disrespectful if youre supporting them so you dont speak on nobody and act a fool
6923872 in some ways you have to assume most of the hip hop community will be behind him because they dont have a choice because their vote aint going to mccain
6923873 but if he uses this kind of secret code the dirt off the shoulder saying you and i both know it but i cant afford to say so it could work for him
6923874 rappers have to realize that supporting obama publicly is like a corporate meeting come support us but dress for the occasion
6923875 its hard you wanna see him be a part of it more but you know the powers that be are going to make it such a big deal theyll be like obama was with dude who was smoking weed i would love to see obama go on
6923876 if a king goes out and fights wars with his people his people will do anything for him
6923877 if youre just a king in your castle and you calling shots then the respect from the people will never be there we dont see our leaders with us in our situations on a heavy heavy level
6923878 a lot of people may not feel me on this but you gotta feel me if you real im not voting for obama
6923879 i dont like obama obama is a traitor he turned his back on everybody he turned his back on reverend jeremiah wright reverend wright has been with him since the beginning ludacris has done stuff in his support he speaks the truth but obama feels that a certain demographic may not vote for him because of it so he turns his back on luda bernie mac he invited bernie mac to come in and do his roast or whatever it was called bernie mac said some things that were offensive thats what bernie mac is known for what does he do turn his back on bernie mac whos he gonna denounce next im not even voting this year if i did vote it would be for mccain i like to know the enemy barack i dont know
6923880 having a young person like obama run for president has inspired many in the hip hop community
6923881 but hes running for president so hes not going to endorse any one genre of music or any one aspect of a cultural phenomenon like hip hop because hes going to be the president of
6923882 it falls short of being four 1 records in a row i think with the jonas brothers second week
6923883 half of that is more than what well sell and its good for those guys all i can say is weve been here for 10 years and this is our sixth record i feel proud to be able to say that if its not 1 its not 1 what are you going to do
6923884 but its just a different version of the boy band thing all over again where its not hip hop or r amp b based theyre playing gibson guitars
6923885 we went in and started writing and the songs that were coming out werent the heaviest songs but they were really good songs
6923886 we wrote 14 songs and there are 13 on the album there was only one song that didnt make it and it wasnt because it didnt stand up i just couldnt come up with anything to sing over it musically it was one of my favorite songs on the record i just couldnt come up with anything that was worthy of it in a melody and lyrical sense the songs we were writing were great songs we couldnt cast them aside and say no those arent heavy enough if we had wed probably still be there writing

6924148 why dost thou call the apostolic chair the chair of pestilence if for the men that sit therein i ask did our lord jesus christ on account of the pharisees reflect upon the chair wherein they sat did he not commend that chair of moses and preserving the honour of the chair reprove them for he sayeth they have sat on the chair of moses all therefore whatsoever they shall say to you observe and do these points if you did well consider you would not for the men whom you defame blaspheme the apostolic see wherewith you do not hold communion
6924149 neither on account of the pharisees to whom you maliciously compare us did our lord command the chair of moses to be forsaken in which chair he verily figured his own for he warned the people to do what they say and not what they do and that the holiness of the chair be in no case forsaken nor the unity of the flock divided on account of the wicked lives of the pastors

6924178 for what it has acknowledged responsibility for the attempt to destroy us as a race of people by taking away our children
6924179 the nation will be enhanced by the constitutional recognition it accords indigenous peoples because governments need to be made accountable in their dealings with aboriginal peoples
6924180 they need to justly and constructively engage via negotiation on the alleviation of the disastrous health education and social ills bedevilling indigenous australians and embark courageously in dialogue on constitutional recognition beyond a preamble
6924181 both matters have to be dealt with and both should involve the free choices of the aboriginal peoples

6924234 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
6924235 i was in high school when she hit it big
6924236 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
6924237 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
6924238 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
6924239 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
6924240 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
6924241 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
6924242 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
6924243 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
6924244 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
6924245 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
6924246 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
6924247 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
6924248 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40
6924249 todays retail sales figures are yet another indicator of an economy in the doldrums with consumer activity now running 5 2 lower than this time last year with far fewer houses being built and fitted out sales of furniture and lighting was down a whopping 18 7 compared with june last year sales of electrical goods as well as hardware paints and glass have also been badly hit with volumes down by more than 10 car sales have also been badly affected by the downturn with motor trade activity running more than 14 lower than last years levels publicans are also feeling the pinch with bar sales down almost 6 as consumers continue to trim their spending habits the contraction in retail sales is having a huge effect on the governments budget because it means far less is collected in value added tax vat receipts for july which reflect retail sales in may and june came in a whopping 460m lower than expected so far this year the government has collected 1 1 billion less in vat than expected at budget time todays figures also reveal that ireland is one of only three countries in the euro area where retail sales have contracted the other two are italy and spain

6924254 no i meant about the magazines you and the three bands you are in were all written about in a bunch recently like rolling stone filter magazine the new york times spin the stranger did a feature on you as the reformation last year i remember thinking hows that feel
6924255 say his new record the wishes and the glitch was recently reviewed in rolling stone and spin among many other publications sophisticated psyche tinged indie rock an eclectic collection of blissed out bass and synth heavy ruminations is what rolling stone had to say about it filter wrote about model photographer and mentioned the other two bands im in the reformation and say hi so yeah that was pretty cool thats the first time ive ever been talked about in such a big magazine
6924256 so whats on the horizon for you youre in three bands and theyre all going somewhere you are obviously the common denominator thats a lot of balls up in the air what if you had to choose
6924257 the first polaroid we clinked our glasses in a toast to celebrate the irony of the first picture taken on a newly bought camera that was sentenced to a life of extinction by kodak less than a month ago cest la vie
6924258 touring lets start by saying touring with say hi is very different than touring with the reformation sometimes you have a few luxuries but yes it can be very tough tough in all kinds of ways including on romantic relationships but in the end there is nothing id rather be doing than playing music i cant imagine what i would do with myself if i couldnt play music all the time i love it more than anything
6924259 yes actually one moment especially captures that spirit and dedication for me which was last summer when you played as revival revival you guys playing in the summer sun last year at the cascades block party man that was for real the crowd was loving it i was actually interviewed by the seattle times about the crime rate and homeless demographic in the neighborhood at one point and you were just having a ball with it all
6924260 yeah that was great thank you what a day yeah that was probably the best show revival revival ever gave we just had so much fun playing the songs of credence clearwater revival it was purely a labor of love we just had a great time performing throughout the summer of 2007 and gave our grand finale performance in september at the s s marie antoinette it was a fun time
6924261 hops shortage you say i had no idea really tell me more
6924262 crop damage actually its hard to get at the moment and local breweries are going under you can check it out online
6924263 so what do you guys think of the event so far
6924264 see im danielle gibeson reporter for mutineer magazine were doing a piece on this event actually can we get your picture with the wine
6924265 it is really packed though last year the venue was better i think it was bigger it was at qwest field last year
6924266 yeah last year was not this crowded but the food is amazing
6924267 my name is phil kline of natural slice vineyards ive had a 26 acre parcel of land my whole adult life but in 2002 i had a mid life crisis and instead of buying a harley i got into the wine business i have the highest elevation in washington situated in west yakima snow just got off my land only last week but i dont make the wine i grow the grapes i let someone who really knows what theyre doing to make the wine but we make a very nice riesling and syrah this is our pinot grigio
6924268 we heard you have good white wine would you come with me to our table over here we need some good white
6924269 lets eat you have to try this stuff and we can take pictures of the chefs
6924270 eat this it is made from organic washington summer peaches it tastes like summer in winter the citrus gelee adds an extra touch of summer with a light lemon zest to compliment the peach mousse
6924271 jeff you have to try this its amazing give me the camera
6924272 so what does being a washington wine ambassador actually mean
6924273 it means you are basically learning and teaching everything you can about wine you get to go on tours of all the local wineries and get to taste all the different wines we sponsor and host lots of wine focused events like this one and taste of seattle just promoting and enjoying wine culture
6924274 i want to be a wine ambassador that sounds like fun
6924275 coming out of a rock n roll band i should have picked a sexier issue lets begin by explaining what irv or ranks choice voting is some people appreciate that
6924276 say we are at the northwest musician appreciation club and we are here to elect a chairman scattered giggling we use the old fashioned traditional run off method like they use in unions so we pass out a ballot everyone gets a ballot we write down our favorite and then we go have a drink a bite to eat chat a little bit now once they count ballots and if someone gets a majority of the votes they win if no one has a majority of the votes we eliminate the last place candidate and pass out a second ballot ok if your candidate is still in the race than you put him down as your first choice but if your first choice was eliminated well ive got to pick one of the four remaining candidates so you put down your second choice we count em again if we have a majority winner we have a chairperson if not we pick up a ballot and do the same thing you get it right we could go through three maybe four ballots people are going i didnt plan on being here until 9 30pm ya know were asking people to name their 2nd 3rd and 4th choices over and over again well we can do all this with one ballot you can put down your 1st 2nd and 3rd choice and then we count them all up if someone got a majority of votes they won if there is no majority you eliminate the last place candidate and those votes just like the traditional way you get those 2nd and 3rd choices and you distribute them to the remaining candidates evenly until someone gets a majority its the same system its in roberts rule of order which is what we use to conduct our business at our musicians appreciation association
6924277 theres the geekwonkey non monotenicity anomaly is that no election system is perfect
6924278 you could be a jerk on a message board who really wants range voting or the condorcet method which are fine but alot of times the supporters of those systems are obsessive and theyll follow like rob or well be on a message board or well write something or well appear in some newspaper and these people will do the same in suspect and come and attack it but the thing is were not attacking what theyre proposing however our proposals have been tested in federal court our proposals have been used in the united states and theirs never have and its alot of work to get something on the ballot and why would you want to take that risk on something thats never been proven
6924279 like the governor of vermont why we have to pressure the governor so much is because his political party has won several seats without a majority
6924280 and he thinks that if this system was in its place he may have lost some of those seats and this may shock you but sometimes politicians consider those factors when evaluating electoral rule
6924281 if your first choice doesnt get picked then your second choice gets credit
6924282 hey krist how to you get ranks choice voting on the ballot

6924295 ive lived here for six months and ive never met any of my neighbors
6924296 well thats a shame you never know whos right next door
6924297 so camille tell me how did you first become involved with fashion
6924298 well this may sound clich but ive always loved fashion my mom is a seamstress so ive always just been sewing things she does interiors so i began with little pillows and what not when i was a kid in high school i took a fashion design class and began designing and making my first clothes when i was 17 i began interning every saturday at pretty parlor with anna banana she took me under her wing and taught me a lot shes such an inspiration and really set me off
6924299 so for my senior project i actually came up with a business plan and sewed my first line called femme fatale or something cute which was based on bond girls
6924300 so what are you up to now whats new any more fashion shows or big projects for my millie vixen
6924301 no actually i am in school right now at the new york fashion academy and working a part time job im going back to school to improve my skills because im basically self taught its a cool school its kicking my ass
6924302 how is school changing your outlook on your design have you noticed its influence in your ideas
6924303 yeah as i learn more skills i learn whats doable and whats not doable i had these crazy ideas but didnt know how to attempt them huge dresses with long trains with corsets but now im like fuck thats going to take 49 hours to do and plus you have to think about money you cant spend too much time on it otherwise you dont make any money
6924304 where else do you get your inspiration from music film history literature pop culture
6924305 i want to work for myself for the rest of my life right now i work at a salon and i love it there but i never want to work for anyone else ever again my dream is to have multiple stores in cities like l a new york miami kind of along the lines of betsey johnson
6924306 ive always wanted to be in l a and actually went there to go to fashion school but i didnt like the people or the atmosphere that much im really well connected here in seattle but i dont want to stay here forever i dont know where i want to go yet someplace warm where i can have a vespa two pugs and a house
6924307 ive got a caucasian lover and hes already pretty spicy
6924308 at the moment im working on three main projects past lives champagne champagne and a new band that doesnt have a name yet ill start with champagne champagne i used to play in a band called the blood brothers and toured non stop for many years that made it really hard for me to try other projects with people outside of the five dudes i saw daily so while on tour i would bring drum machines samplers and recording devices to keep my creative side busy after a few years i started to acquire a large amount of songs when the blood brothers broke up last year it was only natural to unleash the music ive been stock piling i tried a few different mcs over the beats but nothing really worked out coming from a world 100 different from the hip hop world i really had no idea were to look one day i was hanging out with my out of town friend terri from young love and we were talking about what i was trying to do musically he mentioned that he had a buddy named pearl and that he was coming to hang that night pearl and i met talked about what i was trying to do and scheduled a day to meet up and track a song at the time my favorite beat i had was soda and pop rocks so i put it on for him to try some stuff on after a few takes we completed the track and it was fire ever since then we have been writing music and it just works
6924309 the transition between schools wasnt that good for me i hated my new school i started to teach my self how to play i feel like i was really lucky to grow up in the seattle area well the east side we have this place called the redmond firehouse that lets bands come and show there shit we were just a group of 14 year old kids that made noise they still gave us a show and let us grow after a few years of learning our instruments we started to make good music the fire house always had its door open to us and i dont think that music would be such a huge part of my life if they didnt give me the option to explore it i would have just been another kid that played guitar in junior high and then gave it up its great to see that the old fire house is still doing what they do for the next generation of seattle musicians
6924310 bodies were flying around shirts were off dancing was had it was fun we have a big projection screen behind the dj set up its fun to play movies that most people know and can laugh at with out sound shit like lost boys amp goonies we have a full bar and dewars specials all night all of the bands play on floor so the crowd just surrounds them and the room just pulses together its fucking awesome everyone is a part of the performance check it out for the self

6924406 its always our aim to win for the fans and this is going to be an entertaining game
6924407 above all we want to win for the fans who made that long trip to boro last weekend and give them something back hopefully we can make up for that defeat for them
6924408 we know that its a long league season ahead but we cant deny that it was a bad first game and to start with a defeat wasnt good
6924409 lets the hope that saturdays game gives us the chance to put things right with a victory and then we can return to normal
6924410 we are conscious that we put in a very good pre season but we also know that we have to put in maximum effort in games in order to win them
6924411 like every team these days sunderland are very organised and they make things difficult because they compete
6924412 whats always vital is the first goal when its a tight game and until that first goal comes imposing yourself can often be difficult
6924413 three kinds of anarchists i refuse to get along with
6924414 because the evacuation of the regions in armenia which are under the occupation of the russian forces and ought to be rendered to ottoman state this might cause detrimental chaos in the friendly relations of the two states in these regions the ottoman state guarantees without losing time the redressing and arrangements required for the local interests in these provinces where the armenians live and providing the security of the armenians towards kurds and circassians
6924415 the ottoman state guarantees without losing time the redressing and arrangement that are required by the local interests in the provinces where the armenians live and providing peace and security of the armenians towards kurds and circassians and since it shall notify the concerned states about these precautions these states shall monitor the implementation of these precautions
6924416 it is up to the councillors on the day if they wish to go into public excluded as this decision is actually an extension of the hearing process this is normal until the decision is released they are actually deciding on whether to accept the recommended decisions of the commissioners who heard the evidence of all at the hearings they may however decide not to go into public excluded that is up to them obviously once the decision is released it will be sent to all submitters at the same time
6924417 as the establishment of an independent and non communist armenia within the boundaries designated by the abrogated s vres treaty and the enforcement of payment of compensation by turkey in return for the crimes said to have been committed against the armenians
6924418 we will continue to insist on the implementation of the s vres treaty as being one of the milestones in the pursuit of our cause
6924419 a national liberation movement has to go through two phases in order to attain its end firstly the phase of internal propaganda when bases of support are secured secondly the phase of external publicity directed towards gaining the sympathy of the world and attracting attention for the cause hence the necessity for organizing activities that serve as demonstrations
6924420 perhaps no other revolutionary party not even the russian narodovoletz narodnaya volya or the charbonari of the italians adepts though they were at terrorism and undaunted by anything that came in their way could breed terrorists as reckless and impassioned as the dashnaks hundreds of men carrying guns daggers and bombs are up in arms
6924421 we are to continue our struggle for the recognition of the legal rights of the armenian people and of the genocide committed by the turks as well as the payment of a compensation for the human cultural and economic losses endured by our nation and the restitution of the armenian national home which has belonged to us for thousands of years
6924422 terrorism is the last hope and the only path to follow in the liberation struggles of today

6924426 labourers and productive class comprise great majority of humanity this class shall be free from the exploitation of the wealthy sovereign minority which has the capital thereby having all the power and means of production land plants mines and means of transportation the independence of the productive class means the freedom of humanity as a whole general economic prosperity in order to attain this objective and put this into practice actually the productive classes in all civilised countries ought to organise in ways peculiar to themselves and materialise the communist revolution in all countries through activating the general political opportunities under their rule therefore the other classes will disappear and the productive class will establish a socialist order in this establishment people will enact their own laws and show their power now the armenians are under the rule of the classes which are dependent on autocratic regimes their administration taxation and financial systems are destructive for them one hand capitalist production methods are applied in these countries and on the other hand the old economic and management methods are being annihilated continuously
6924427 taking the serious responsibility that is required by our activities and objectives and the danger emanating from them into account we have to avoid adventures and irresponsible behaviour in order to prove that we are civilised people the balanced influences and means which are planned meticulously are the only solutions to achieve our goals and our operations
6924428 tashnaqsutyun congress takes into account economic social and administrative policies contrasting and followed by the government of party of union and progress against christian factors and especially armenians and its deceptive activities about oppression and reforms so it decided to remain as an opponent to the party to criticize partys political program to struggle severely against itself and its organization
6924429 russian armenians will fulfil their duties in order to take revenge of the abuse against our brothers corpses by taking place on the side of moscow armies we armenians under the tyranny of turks shouldnt point any of our arms to france which is our second homeland and to its allies and friends armenians turkey calls you to arms without telling you who the enemy is to enlist voluntarily in the french army and its allies in order to help the defeat of wilhelm iis army whose railways passed over the corpses of 300 000 of our brothers
6924430 when the war broke out armenians in that region eastern towns contacted with russian authorities in the caucasus secretly and volunteers from turkish towns were begun to join the russian forces by the help of an underground organization
6924431 garo pasdermichan pastirmaciyan deputy of erzurum passed across the border to join the russian army with almost all the armenian officials and soldiers the third army
6924432 in compliance with the 1908 constitution the government of enver pasha had the right to call armenians to arms together with turks who were at the right age for military service however they immediately began to resist with arms against authorities especially in zeytun along the eastern borders armenians began to escape and join russian armies the government of enver suspected the loyalty of the rest and transferred them to working battalions

6924450 ja ik heb het bericht om 10 voor 7 ingesproken
6924451 the promises given to turkish armenians until today lead to the right to establish an armenian home in east anatolia for its realization the board of the league of nations gave some privileges to armenians and they were in compliance with their decision about the suitable territory
6924452 the majority in cilicia was muslims and turks therefore cilicia could be left to turks
6924453 the position of armenians should be taken into consideration due to the disasters they faced and the favors they had done to the allied states during the war therefore it is requested that the league of nations help to find a national home in order to protect armenians and to find a solution to their problem
6924454 now i will talk about armenians these deserve to be taken into consideration due to the guarantee given to them about their future but not due to the cruelties which they faced through several generations which horrified the modern world in erivan which is now one of soviet republics there is an armenian government as i heard their population is 1 250 000 because of great numbers of immigrants coming from various regions the country is over populated and cannot accept any immigrants on the other hand armenians in kars ardahan van bitlis erzurum were harmed when the french withdrew from cilicia armenian people living there followed the french army due to fear now they live in iskenderun aleppo beirut and along the turkish border of syria scattered here and there in my opinion the number of armenians living in anatolia was three million previously but now there remained 130 000 most of them immigrated to the caucasus russia iran and the other neighboring countries i think it would be necessary to add special articles in the treaty concerning the protection and the security of armenians who would be in large numbers in anatolia and thrace in the future now i will mention the demands of both armenians and their sympathizers in order to found an armenian land it is so natural that armenians want to live in their own land the territory of armenia republic would not be sufficient for them because of this the armenians living in turkey demand the land in either northeast or southeast of cilicia circumstances make it impossible to realize those demands now when compared to the past however we would be pleased to find out the thoughts of turkish representatives on this issue
6924455 turkish people and turkish government always tried to settle the rebellions and reacted to them when their patience came to an end the reasons for the evil actions armenians are faced with in turkey were their own atrocities adana events in 1909 and rebellions provoked in many towns of anatolia during the first world war were the continuation of the same horrible tragedy as it is understood from the events mentioned here unless the non muslim subjects of the ottoman empire misused the good will of the administrators of the country where they lived in peace and wealth for hundreds of years turks never denied their rights the jewish community who has never complained about any inhuman treatment of the turkish government and people is an example which proves for the tragic events that happened armenians and byzantine greeks were responsible therefore history emphasizes that the two principle factors of the minorities issue should be borne in mind firstly foreign political influences by some states emerging with the desire to interfere with the domestic affairs of the country under the cover of protecting the minorities and hence the creation of the desired disorder with provocation and riot secondly domestic political factors which emerge after the tendency the minorities concerning their freedom in order to found an independent state when we consider armenians the relations which were consolidated with the treaties between turkey and the armenian republic removed the possibility of a siege by the armenian republic on the other hand armenians who decided to stay in turkey should take into account the necessity of living as decent citizens as a result the representatives of turkish grand national assembly think that first of all improvements in the life conditions of minorities in turkey depends on the removal of all the provocation caused by all foreign interference in order to reach this target firstly it is necessary to exchange turks and byzantine greeks the best guarantee for the reliability of the minorities which are excluded from the mutual exchange measures and for reforms was the legal guarantee provided by turkey for all the communities who have given up the duties to be undertaken by turkish citizens
6924456 due to the explanations by the committees in lausanne conference and the peace treaty project published in newspapers armenian representatives understood that the entente powers had left the armenian issue to its fate
6924457 we demand that our aforementioned territories should be annexed to soviet armenia in return for the confiscation of our goods and the invasion of our territories by turks during the events resulted in the death of one and half million armenians
6924458 each englishman who knows armenian history knows about their sufferings and sympathize them we will try to make these positive feelings the general view of english public opinion when we return home
6924459 armenians just want justice to prevail in order that their territories are given back to them
6924460 armenians in paris welcomed general sunay and expressed their respect and regard for this country turkish president received a standing ovation from them however we would like to emphasize that it does not mean that armenians do not demand anything from turkey we would not give up our just cause we will continue our struggle in the political arena in peace and try to find a solution

6924517 if by any chance the armenian nation has been preserved as a nation and if it is preserving its beliefs its church language history and cultural values all these are due to the protection help and benevolence shown by the turkish government to the armenian nation fate bounds armenians to turks because of this armenians can not remain indifferent during wars and hardships facing the state on the contrary they are obliged to help the state as they have always done the armenian who loves his homeland and who will help the state will receive the best service of his own nation

6924520 theyre still not behind obama some of them are stirring up a lot of trouble i dont like it im a peace maker this story empowers the puma crowd because they see this and i do too as sort of disrespecting senator clinton and breaking senator obamas word
6924521 the meek may inherit the earth but they wont keep it long
6924522 i see puma as a steadfast state of consciousness that wants democracy back in the democratic party its a virtual think tank where every democrat that wants democracy back in the democratic party can particpate and become active
6924523 i love clinton and passionately want to see her become potus it may be that i would not have noticed had she not been in the race but my opposition to the dnc is not because of my support for her rather it was my support for her that opened my eyes to the disease in the party
6924524 well we dont want to win but we also dont want to be too obvious about it say lets find an inexperienced but media attractive man its got to be a man because having a woman so close to becoming potus is too scary and we dont want to take that risk with a diverse background who is narcissistic enough to think hes qualified to be potus but who even in losing and well make sure that he gets the nomination but then loses the election will send a clear message to disadvantaged groups and youth that anything is possible in america everyone will love us and re elect us oh and of course it would be a good thing for the country
6924525 if supers pick the candidate ill quit i swear i will

6924618 man is created to praise reverence and serve god our lord and by this means to save his soul
6924619 the goal of our life is to live with god forever our own response of love allows gods life to flow into us without limit our only desire and our one choice should be i want and i choose what better leads to the deepening of gods life in me
6924620 lord grant that i may see thee more clearly love thee more dearly follow thee more nearly
6924621 jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
6924622 and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish my father which gave them me is greater than all
6924623 and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ
6924624 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost
6924625 then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
6924626 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
6924627 but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you
6924628 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
6924629 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
6924630 and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour
6924631 search me o god and know my heart try me and know
6924632 jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
6924633 jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work
6924634 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
6924635 not only to apply ones self to ones own salvation and to perfection with the help of divine grace but to employ all ones strength for the salvation and perfection of ones neighbor
6924636 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
6924637 and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men
6924638 love god in all things and all things in god
6924639 but our god is in the heavens he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased
6924640 for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing
6924641 when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord

6924666 due to the process of learning which they have gone through these two minded lds often no longer accept the church as the only true one with the only true priesthood authority and the only valid sacred ordinances but they see it as a christian church in which good inspired programs are found as well as failure and error
6924667 since the social relationships between them and other ward or stake members suffer avoidance silence even mobbing because of their status as heretics which is usually known via gossip and since the extent of active involvement and range of possible callings are reduced because of their nonconformity in various areas there is a risk that they end up leaving the church after all because they are simply ignored by the majority of the other members
6924668 it is necessary that the church not only shows more support and openness to these apostates but also teaches and advises all members bishops stake presidents etc who usually dont know how to deal with such a situation in terms of organizational and ecclesiastical questions and out of insecurity fail to treat the critical member with the necessary love and respect that even a normal stranger would receive

6924753 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
6924754 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
6924755 as you can see ice has grown in nearly every direction since last summer with a large increase in the area north of siberia also note that the area around the northwest passage west of greenland has seen a significant increase in ice some of the islands in the canadian archipelago are surrounded by more ice than they were during the summer of 1980
6924756 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

6924856 when life seems to be the hardest i always must remember that im depending upon unseen resources
6924857 throughout the months of recuperation ignatius noticed how god led him to pay attention to the diverse voices inside of him to the movements of consolation and desolation in his heart and spirit he learned that god was shaping and forming him to be a companion of jesus the fruit of these months of prayer and reflection is contained in his spiritual exercises
6924858 where he practised the most rigorous asceticism with frequent confessions and masses and the performance of the most disagreeable and menial tasks he is said to have had visions of the trinity of the mystery of the creation of the union of deity and humanity in christ in the eucharist
6924859 the contemplation of any religious act or meditation on any of the great facts of redemption brought before his susceptible mind realistic images of the events concerned the virgin became the object of his devotion
6924860 ignatius possibly learned about the spiritual advantages of the practice taking the eucharist more often at montserrat by the time he was at manresa he was receiving the eucharist every sunday at manresa moreover he discovered entire fourth book of the imitation is on the eucharist the fifth chapter of which recommends its frequent reception
6924861 it was at this time too that he began to make notes of his spiritual experiences notes which grew into the little book of
6924862 god also afflicted him with severe sicknesses when he was looked after by friends in the public hospital for many felt drawn towards him and he requited their many kind offices by teaching them how to pray and instructing them in spiritual matters
6924863 military imagery played a prominent part in his religious contemplations before he left manresa he had wrought out his
6924864 designed to reflect the idea that any work that is not evil can be meritorious for the spiritual life if it is performed with this intention
6924865 the type of academic psychological and spiritual education for which the jesuits became so famous was well worked out before the founders death the tone remained religious students must hear mass every day go to confession every month and begin their studies with prayer their master should take every fit occasion to inspire them with love of heavenly things and encourage a fervent habit of prayer
6924866 a small group using a loudspeaker demonstrated at kini radio in st francis recently the group led by alfred bone shirt and others say they want equal access to the airwaves
6924867 the radio station is owned by the rosebud reservations jesuit community which hires indians to work at the station group members say tribal members are denied access to the airwaves to discuss political issues on the reservation
6924868 bone shirt said his grooup will keep coming back to the radio station to protest
6924869 if lakota people are denied access to promote and discuss lakota issues and political issues then the jesuit community should turn the station over to tribal members were not going to take it anymore only certain people are allowed access to the airwaves were not going to take it anymore

6925062 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6925063 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6925064 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6925065 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation

6925105 i see the immigrant community wanting to be a part of this
6925106 but where are the black people born in this country
6925107 i hear from different individuals about what youre doing in the community

6925116 i love what i do i havent looked at the offer yet ive been at the gang violence task force meeting all morning
6925117 i have no idea id be really torn i love my community and ive been able to do some great work in this place were luckier here at the oregonian than at a lot of other newspapers where they have just laid people off with a months notice
6925118 i think the buyout offer is testament to stickel in particular in that they have treated people like a family to how much they care about the people who have given their lives to this place
6925119 people at this point are really more concerned about whether it makes sense financially to go sooner than they had planned
6925120 there hasnt been a package like this ever i dont think
6925121 of course i may end up taking the offer but being at the bottom of the list
6925122 the question were all asking is there more stability in taking the buyout offer or in staying at the newspaper
6925123 i dont know what the deal is at your shop but were all at a total loss right now as to the future of our business the future of journalism and whether we have this ridiculous confluence of a bad economy and a rapidly evolving information system that might leave newspapers behind
6925124 the buyout offer arrives at a really interesting been intense for a while in there but a lot of us are understandably and naturally conflicted especially those of us who love what we do about whether its time to pursue something else or renew our commitment
6925125 that you should never be afraid to quit a job and a lot of us are trying to make sense of a business we assumed would be here for our lifetimes is the rug being pulled out from underneath us not by the oregonians buyout offer but by a business thats rapidly changing

6925189 you can definitely affect the market by what you put into it

6925196 the taxpayers are footing the bill for essentially four day long campaign ads for the parties and their candidates
6925197 it was to try to insulate the people who end up in the white house from that money fundraising phase where people who raise the money might be expecting some sort of special consideration down the road
6925198 with the checkoff the concept is only if citizens are actually willing to basically earmark at that time a dollar of their taxes to go to this program will it go there

6925201 i introduced this measure with the aim of preventing another catastrophic fish kill like the one that took place on prospect island last year to protect our states declining fisheries and the commercial and sport fishing industries those fisheries support
6925202 todays vote takes us a step closer to that goal discussion on this issue and the broader effort to save the delta and its fisheries continues to move forward i hope that the fishing community will continue to actively participate in the conversation and thank them for their support in this effort
6925203 it addresses part of the problem stopping a repeat of the horrendous fish kill that occurred at prospect island last year
6925204 however the amended bill does nothing to mitigate the impacts of the state and federal water projects as well as proposals to modify the hydrology of the delta on chinook salmon steelhead delta smelt striped bass and other fish
6925205 the fishing community should be indebted for wolks efforts on behalf of california fisheries unfortunately the fishing community was not able to overcome the scorched earth style opposition of the hydraulic brotherhood to consider mitigation for the damage they have caused to delta fisheries
6925206 the death of tens of thousands of fish including striped bass and other sportfish could have been prevented with some basic planning this bill is a strong first step towards preventing further losses to our states fisheries
6925207 the fishing community is disappointed that the badly needed mitigation provisions of the bill didnt pass
6925208 however we are pleased that ab 1806 will help coordinate and plan fish rescues in the future so a tragic disaster like the prospect island fish kill wont occur again
6925209 we need to do everything we can in the future to pass a bill that will hold the water contractors and agencies accountable for the damages theyve caused to our fisheries
6925210 the state and federal agencies are responsible for restoring delta fisheries and the ecosystem for too long fishermen and others have been disenfranchised by the agencies that are supposed to uphold the public trust

6925587 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration

6925599 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
6925600 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
6925601 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
6925602 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back

6925698 but its wonderful that we have this long history of gay comics and im proud to be part of it
6925699 my friend andrea and i used to plan our own birthday parties we didnt trust anyone else to get it right and we dont like surprises
6925700 i wanted to write about her and i had an axe to grind with the ex who had just dumped me so all the early strips were just about me and andrea and my ex who became the character walter
6925701 i would draw one copy and circulate it around class
6925702 not much has changed since then in high school i got serious about it i took every art class i could and i would submit samples to archie comics
6925703 i was one of very few people doing comedy critics were negative because apparently i wasnt portraying gay characters the way they were supposed to be portrayed but i was just writing about people i knew
6925704 so ive often been on the outs with the gay community which is sort of a theme in jayson anyway he wants acceptance but on his own terms
6925705 people said it stood the test of time because its character based
6925706 there was plenty of gay theatre in new york and an audience for it but gay theatre at the time was as much of a downer as gay comics had been i thought it was time to laugh again
6925707 the good news is that we ran for ten weeks and made 30 000
6925708 with an a story and a b story which was great and allowed me to feature more of the supporting characters

6925713 music has proved a wand of empowerment for the vast array of texans who have wielded it
6925714 this between the lines conclusion that music enables transcendence grows out of hartmans thesis that texas ethnic diversity has engendered a musical cross pollination that forms the backbone of american music the manifestation of that notion is the history of texas music a concise primer on the states music examined in social political and economic contexts
6925715 hartman takes one step backward to scott joplin of texarkana whose ragtime and boogie woogie piano playing learned under the tutelage of a german texan named julius weiss foreshadowed two jazz geniuses
6925716 in writing treemonisha the libretto was his own joplin clearly intended to author a social as well as musical document he set up the forces of ignorance and superstition against liberalism and education represented by a young lady named treemonisha
6925717 morehouse college aided by a rockefeller grant gave treemonisha an ambitious performance

6925729 i was told i was a positive match and so we got pretty excited about the idea of being able to contribute to someone that was in deep need of some bone marrow
6925730 i have a brother and two sisters they were not compatible with me
6925731 and ive been lucky to have someone matching and right now im here because of that
6925732 its important that people understand that its a painless program
6925733 this festival set out to have an impact on political discourse and we are honored to have so many lawmakers journalists and activists joining our filmmakers and subjects to discuss the issues and priorities explored in our exceptional films
6925734 i definitely want to get something bad on the road
6925735 big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
6925736 wir haben als reine technik firma angefangen stellten dann aber schnell fest die technik allein bringt nicht das was organisationen oder politiker brauchen also haben wir neben der technik auch die strategie f r ihre anwendung angeboten
6925737 we definitely wanted to get the first one under our belt
6925738 there are still things we need to work on but i felt like we controlled most of the game i would have liked to finish a few more chances and in the final third but we didnt expect perfection today were just taking it one step at a time and we can take a lot from today to make ourselves better for next friday
6925739 we as a team didnt want to stop at 1 0 and we needed another goal
6925740 lizzy is playing at a different position for us than she is used to at center forward and shes going to be a great one
6925741 she has a lot to learn but i was definitely impressed with her she keeps getting better and better as the preseason has gone she is learning quickly and we are very pleased with her and have high expectations for her
6925742 coach monaghan is a great coach and we have great girls on our team
6925743 they work hard every minute of every day that is what im here for and im very happy to be here
6925744 georg salzner is an exceptional person and we are proud to have him as our president dario sattui formerly known as darryl the exotic winerys owner a spokesman for the company couldnt immediately identify the former president of castello di amorosa or explain what happened to that individual
6925745 brian j noggle apparently forgot that the proper design for a tin foil beanie calls for the shiny side out
6925746 im weeping openly right now thanks for hurting my feelings pinhead
6925747 breaking news obama will deliver text tommorow before springfield event
6925748 a lot of people are afraid to say what they want thats why they dont get what they want
6925749 with all of the vice presidential buzz in the air and the democratic convention just days away whats most important is what
6925750 quite simply he needs to create a more compelling narrative on change use history as a context for the economy and get mad about something
6925751 first and foremost obama must bring a narrative to his position as a change agent you cant simply seek change for changes sake
6925752 the argument must be made that this is an election with two choices the change seeking good guys or the status quo clinging bad guys the campaign needs to brand every negative attack by the republicans as just another desperate attempt of the status quo clinging to power
6925753 obamas campaign should argue that all of our political friends have the courage to break from the same old game in washington in order to provide the change we need while all of sen mccains friends in washington refuse a new direction for america
6925754 and he certainly offers more of the same failed bush economic policy which leads me to my next point
6925755 obama can connect with voters on the economy by using history as a guideline
6925756 the campaign needs to say that since 1900 democratic presidents have not only won but dominated on every economic front gdp growth employment deficit and income equality need more how about a better performing stock market and a more fiscally responsible spending
6925757 theres no need to listen to mccains marginal rates death tax deregulation trickle down supply side shenanigans because historically democratic presidencies have produced better economies
6925758 desperately looking for something to relieve his boredom but with little strength to perform everyday tasks he picked up a pencil and started doodling on paper
6925759 although js is never going to replace the server side website completely not if you care about accessibility anyway
6925760 this kind of basic analysis thats not supported by any evidence after two years is not going to assuage family members concerns
6925761 it is difficult to imagine a more archetypal instance of the press informing the public of government operations through government records than ostergrens posting of public records to demonstrate the lack of care being taken by the government to protect the private information of individuals
6925762 in the end it appears this law was passed not for the purpose of protecting social security numbers but to silence a critic of the states failure to protect such numbers from identity thieves
6925763 fuck the purebreds fuck fuck the queen if you cant hear them howling then you wont hear me scream
6925764 just because youre not wearing pants doesnt mean you cant practice well
6925765 we kunnen alles en doen dat vaak ook zegt gerard kiffen 47 wijkagent van palenstein
6925766 wij zijn voor alle handelingen opgeleid die de politie mag doen maar we doen van alles maar een beetje wijkagenten sturen de burger vervolgens door naar de collegas die zijn gespecialiseerd in de handeling waar het om gaat dit kan bijvoorbeeld om een mishandeling of zedendelict gaan

6925770 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6925771 if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6925772 i will put my judgment on foreign policy over the last five years against john mccains anytime anytime
6925773 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6925774 maar of dit uniek is in nederland weten wij niet
6925775 maar je kunt dit gerust uniek noemen zegt ronald zijlstra namens de nvvb
6925776 sommige gemeentes proberen veel om op het gebied van internet en multimedia voorop te lopen
6925777 het werkt ze komen de zaal binnen ah ze ziet er prachtig uit en de bruidegom ook
6925778 ik weet alleen niet hoe en we hebben op deze computer nu geen geluid
6925779 dat was vanmorgen niet zo toen ik met haar kapsel bezig was
6925780 ze zegt nee klinkt het vanachter de toonbank klanten en andere de kapsters lachen in de wetenschap dat maurits en anneloes nu cht een paar zijn
6925781 ik was wel stomverbaasd toen ik hoorde dat dit een primeur is zegt maurits dusoswa
6925782 ik dacht dat dit de normaalste zaak van de wereld was
6925783 there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section
6925784 there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
6925785 it is all about the scoring an activity usually taken for granted
6925786 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6925787 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6925788 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6925789 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6925790 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6925791 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6925792 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realise that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6925793 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one per cent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 per cent said they hated it thats a lot
6925794 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
6925795 wait wait wait backtrack a little where did the blood come from you didnt say anything about blood
6925796 dat is echt de meest gehoorde leus over ons zegt frank de koning 45 wijkagent van buytenwegh
6925797 maar je hoeft ons ook niet elke dag te zien
6925798 de hoofdgedachte blijft ons kantoor ligt op straat wij moeten zakendoen in de wijk zegt kiffen
6925799 als vakboer loop ik door de wijk en zie ik dat het sociale vlak leeft zegt kiffen
6925800 je ziet veel stoeptegelkijkers in de wijk dat zijn mensen die naar beneden staren en niet met hun gezicht de wereld inkijken ik wil ervoor zorgen dat mensen elkaar gaan aankijken zodat ze weerbaarder worden ja dat vind ik ook tot mijn takenpakket horen
6925801 wat in deze wijk opvalt is dat er veel huiselijk geweld plaatsvindt mochten wij bij een familie geweld ontdekken dan ondernemen wij natuurlijk actie en wij komen twee keer terug om te kijken hoe het nu is gesteld ook blijven we met buurtpanels alles in de gaten houden
6925802 zo hebben wij geflyerd in de hele wijk voor was kracht daar kwamen vijf reacties op dan moet je je als diender afvragen hoe re el is het om dit op te zetten
6925803 het aantal uur dat de jongerenwerkers in de wijk werken bijvoorbeeld ze willen vaker de straat op
6925804 mensen moeten niet bang zijn voor de jeugd dat is ook nergens voor nodig
6925805 als de burger wat heeft gemeld dan moeten we altijd laten horen wat we ermee hebben gedaan

6925837 thats okay would you still be willing to help us by answering a few questions
6925838 our purpose is to love god and others through jesus christ
6925839 if sinners be damned at least let them leap to hell over our bodies and if they perish let them perish with our arms around their knees imploring them to stay if hell must be filled at least let it be filled in the teeth of our exertions and let not one go there unwarned or unprayed for

6925898 you know im right the sooner you suck it up and try again the sooner you will be over this
6925899 the attempt to delay democracy by this government is breathtaking this is a cynical attempt to muzzle the voice of nzers who are opposed to the hugely unpopular and highly flawed anti smacking law
6925900 the referenda held at the same time as the 1999 general election caused confusion congestion in polling places and significantly delayed the preliminary results and the chief electoral officer has advised me the same problems would occur this year if the referendum was held at the same time as the general election
6925901 they do not know how they need more and better training
6925902 and he personally gave some to be apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the training of the saints in the work of ministry to build up the body of christ
6925903 this applies only to those of you who have the gift of evangelism
6925904 i am the vine you are the branches the one who remains in me and i in him produces much fruit because you can do nothing without me
6925905 you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you
6925906 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth go therefore and make disciples
6925907 consequently because all authority has been given to me you go
6925908 as the father has sent me i also send you
6925909 i am able to do all things through him who strengthens me
6925910 the preaching or promulgation of the gospel the work of an evangelist
6925911 gods act of working through believers empowered by the holy spirit to communicate the good news of jesus christ to every person and people group with the purpose to persuade the lost to come to salvation
6925912 to evangelize is to spread the good news that jesus christ died for our sins and was raised from the dead according to the scriptures and that as reigning lord he now offers the forgiveness of sins and the liberating gift of the spirit to all who repent and believe evangelism itself is the proclamation of the historical biblical christ as savior and lord with a view to persuading people to come to him personally and so be reconciled to god
6925913 evangelism is the proclamation of the gospel of the crucified and risen christ the only redeemer of men according to the scriptures with the purpose of persuading condemned and lost sinners to put their trust in god by receiving and accepting christ as savior through the power of the holy spirit and to serve christ as lord in every calling of life and in the fellowship of his church looking toward the day of his coming in glory
6925914 evangelism is one beggar telling another beggar where to find bread
6925915 i dont talk about jesus i just live a good consistent life and let other people see him in me
6925916 all authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe everything i have commanded you and remember i am with you always to the end of the age
6925917 you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth
6925918 we engage in evangelism not necessarily because we want to or because we choose to or because we like to but because we have been told to the church is under orders the risen lord has commanded us to go to preach and to make disciples and that is enough for us
6925919 the son of man has come to seek and to save the lost
6925920 at that time you were without the messiah excluded from the citizenship of israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise with no hope and without god in the world
6925921 the one who believes in the son has eternal life but the one who refuses to believe in the son will not see life instead the wrath of god remains on him
6925922 young men if i could have had my way i would never have had you here for these years of training but i would have put you in hell for 24 hours i would have allowed you to feel the pains and pangs of the damned to hear the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth i would have caused you to see how they suffer forever then i would have sent you out into the world to warn men to flee from the wrath to come
6925923 he was right if we really knew what hell was like nothing could stop us from urging men to come to christ
6925924 i mean there wasnt even a hades a gehenna or a sheol
6925925 very little will stultify evangelism and missions any quicker than the belief that nobody is really lost and everybody is going to make it to heaven sooner or later why go across the sea or across the street with the message of jesus if everybody is either already saved or everybody will make it to heaven ultimately anyhow
6925926 what would you do if you met a really modern man on a train and you had just an hour to talk with him about the gospel
6925927 i would spend forty five or fifty minutes to really show him his dilemma to show him that he is even more dead than he thinks he is that he is morally dead because he is separated from the god who exists often it takes a long time to bring a person to the place where he understands the negative and unless he understands whats wrong he will not be ready to listen to and understand the positive
6925928 now is the acceptable time now is the day of salvation
6925929 we must do the works of him who sent me while it is day night is coming when no one can work
6925930 the grace of god has appeared with salvation for all people instructing us to deny godlessness and worldly lusts and to live in a sensible righteous and godly way in the present age while we wait for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great god and savior jesus christ
6925931 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
6925932 little gti youre so much fun i love to drive you
6925933 i have come that they may have life and have it in abundance
6925934 the highest science the loftiest speculation the mightiest philosophy which can ever engage our attention is the name the nature the person the work the doings and the existence of the great god
6925935 all scripture is inspired by god and is profitable for teaching for rebuking for correcting for training in righteousness so that the man of god may be complete equipped for every good work
6925936 beginning with moses and all the prophets he interpreted for them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures
6925937 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy one is understanding
6925938 i never stop giving thanks for you as i remember you in my prayers i pray that the god of our lord jesus christ the glorious father would give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him i pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so you may know what is the hope of his calling what are the glorious riches of his inheritance among the saints and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power to us who believe according to the working of his vast strength
6925939 this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and the one you have sent jesus christ
6925940 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me
6925941 and this is the testimony god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son the one who has the son has life the one who doesnt have the son of god does not have life i have written these things to you who believe in the name of the son of god so that you may know that you have eternal life
6925942 he came to his own and his own people did not receive him but to all who did receive him he gave them the right to be children of god to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man but of god
6925943 that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures
6925944 the son of man has come to save the lost
6925945 i was guilty when i was born i was sinful when my mother conceived me
6925946 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
6925947 you are free to eat from any tree of the garden but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil for on the day you eat from it you will certainly die
6925948 he said to the woman did god really say you cant eat from any tree in the garden
6925949 the woman said to the serpent we may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden god said you must not eat it or touch it or you will die
6925950 the ancient serpent who is called the devil and satan the one who deceives the whole world
6925951 he was a murderer from the beginning and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him when he tells a lie he speaks from his own nature because he is a liar and the father of liars
6925952 your adversary the devil is prowling around like a roaring lion looking for anyone he can devour
6925953 our battle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the world powers of this darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens
6925954 sin entered the world through one man and death through sin in this way death spread to all men because all sinned
6925955 the heart is more deceitful than anything else and desperately sick who can understand it
6925956 we all went astray like sheep we all have turned to our own way
6925957 for gods wrath is revealed from heaven against all godlessness and unrighteousness of people who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth since what can be known about god is evident among them because god has shown it to them
6925958 therefore god delivered them over in the cravings of their hearts to sexual impurity so that their bodies were degraded among themselves they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshiped and served something created instead of the creator who is blessed forever amen
6925959 dont fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
6925960 young man there is a move but there is only one
6925961 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he was with god in the beginning all things were created through him and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created life was in him and that life was the light of men that light shines in the darkness yet the darkness did not overcome it
6925962 christ jesus existing in the form of god did not consider equality with god as something to be used for his own advantage instead he emptied himself by assuming the form of a slave taking on the likeness of men and when he had come as a man in his external form he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even to death on a cross
6925963 for god loved the world in this way he gave his one and only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life
6925964 the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world
6925965 we all went astray like sheep we all have turned to our own way and the lord has punished him for the iniquity of us all
6925966 he made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of god in him
6925967 dont be alarmed he told them you are looking for jesus the nazarene who was crucified he has been resurrected he is not here
6925968 has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
6925969 jesus paid it all all to him i owe sin had left a crimson stain he washed it white as snow
6925970 in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace
6925971 there is no one who does good god looks down from heaven on the human race to see if there is one who is wise and who seeks god everyone has turned aside they have all become corrupt there is no one who does good not even one
6925972 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him
6925973 by grace you are saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is gods gift not from works so that no one can boast
6925974 faith comes from what is heard and what is heard comes through the message about christ
6925975 for the lord is good and his love is eternal his faithfulness endures through all generations
6925976 just as i am without one plea but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou biddst me come to thee o lamb of god i come i come
6925977 both the spirit and the bride say come anyone who hears should say come and the one who is thirsty should come whoever desires should take the living water as a gift
6925978 everyone the father gives me will come to me and the one who comes to me i will never cast out
6925979 whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life because of me and the gospel will save it
6925980 for what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul for what will a man give in exchange for his soul
6925981 to all who did receive him he gave them the right to be children of god to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man but of god
6925982 if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved with the heart one believes resulting in righteousness and with the mouth one confesses resulting in salvation now the scripture says no one who believes on him will be put to shame for there is no distinction between jew and greek since the same lord of all is rich to all who call on him for everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved
6925983 god knows your hearts for what is highly admired by people is revolting in gods sight
6925984 lord jesus christ i confess that i am a guilty and helpless sinner there is nothing that i can do to save myself but i have heard the good news about what you have done for me thank you for dying in my place i rejoice that you were raised from the dead i am turning from sin to you i submit to you and acknowledge that you are lord i am surrendering the control of my life to you i am turning from every other allegiance right now i trust only you as my personal lord and savior in your name i pray amen
6925985 do not be amazed that i told you that you must be born again the wind blows where it pleases and you hear its sound but you dont know where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit
6925986 to all who did receive him jesus he gave them the right to be children of god to those who believe in his name who were born not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man but of god
6925987 therefore if anyone is in christ there is a new creation old things have passed away and look new things have come
6925988 i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
6925989 in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding
6925990 in him we were also made his inheritance predestined according to the purpose of the one who works out everything in agreement with the decision of his will so that we who had already put our hope in the messiah might bring praise to his glory in him you also when you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in him when you believed were sealed with the promised holy spirit he is the down payment of our inheritance for the redemption of the possession to the praise of his glory
6925991 my sheep hear my voice i know them and they follow me i give them eternal life and they will never perish ever no one will snatch them out of my hand my father who has given them to me is greater than all no one is able to snatch them out of the fathers hand the father and i are one
6925992 how can i know that this is really happening how can i know that my sins are forgiven and that i have eternal life in christ
6925993 because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of it the world hates you remember the word i spoke to you a slave is not greater than his master if they persecuted me they will also persecute you if they kept my word they will also keep yours but they will do all these things to you on account of my name because they dont know the one who sent me
6925994 you will have suffering in this world be courageous i have conquered the world
6925995 and this is the testimony god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son the one who has the son has life the one who doesnt have the son of god does not have life i have written these things to you who believe in the name of the son of god so that you may know that you have eternal life
6925996 as it is written because of you we are being put to death all day long we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered no in all these things we are more than victorious through him who loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other created thing will have the power to separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord
6925997 everyone who will acknowledge me before men i will also acknowledge him before my father in heaven but whoever denies me before men i will also deny him before my father in heaven
6925998 those who accepted his message were baptized and that day about 3 000 people were added to them
6925999 as they were traveling down the road they came to some water the eunuch said look theres water what would keep me from being baptized and philip said if you believe with all your heart you may and he replied i believe that jesus christ is the son of god then he ordered the chariot to stop and both philip and the eunuch went down into the water and he baptized him
6926000 crispus the leader of the synagogue believed the lord along with his whole household and many of the corinthians when they heard believed and were baptized
6926001 do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to determine if they are from god because many false prophets have gone out into the world
6926002 there are some who are troubling you and want to change the gospel of christ but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel other than what we have preached to you a curse be on him as we have said before i now say again if anyone preaches to you a gospel contrary to what you received a curse be on him
6926003 wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereto according to thy word thy word have i hid in mine heart that i might not sin against thee
6926004 all scripture is inspired by god and is profitable for teaching for rebuking for correcting for training in righteousness so that the man of god may be complete equipped for every good work
6926005 you dont have his word living in you because you dont believe the one he sent you pore over the scriptures because you think you have eternal life in them yet they testify about me and you are not willing to come to me that you may have life
6926006 i have spoken these things to you while i remain with you but the counselor the holy spirit the father will send him in my name will teach you all things and remind you of everything i have told you
6926007 very early in the morning while it was still dark he got up went out and made his way to a deserted place and he was praying there
6926008 clap your hands all you peoples shout to god with a jubilant cry
6926009 he lets me lie down in green pastures he leads me beside quiet waters
6926010 if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
6926011 pray also for me that the message may be given to me when i open my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for this i am an ambassador in chains pray that i might be bold enough in him to speak as i should
6926012 dont worry about anything but in everything through prayer and petition with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god which surpasses every thought will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
6926013 let us be concerned about one another in order to promote love and good works not staying away from our meetings as some habitually do but encouraging each other
6926014 by this all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
6926015 carry one anothers burdens in this way you will fulfill the law of christ
6926016 based on the gift they have received everyone should use it to serve others as good managers of the varied grace of god if anyone speaks his speech should be like the oracles of god if anyone serves his service should be from the strength god provides so that in everything god may be glorified through jesus christ
6926017 when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth for he will not speak on his own but he will speak whatever he hears he will also declare to you what is to come he will glorify me because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you
6926018 you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses to the ends of the earth
6926019 every day in the temple complex and in various homes they continued teaching and proclaiming the good news that the messiah is jesus
6926020 so those who were scattered went on their way proclaiming the message of good news
6926021 these men who have turned the world upside down have come here too
6926022 when he saw the crowds he felt compassion for them because they were weary and worn out like sheep without a shepherd
6926023 we are ambassadors for christ certain that god is appealing through us we plead on christs behalf be reconciled to god
6926024 you are in christ jesus who for us became wisdom from god as well as righteousness sanctification and redemption in order that as it is written the one who boasts must boast in the lord
6926025 as the one who called you is holy you also are to be holy in all your conduct for it is written be holy because i am holy
6926026 i do not consider myself to have taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and reaching forward to what is ahead i pursue as my goal the prize promised by gods heavenly call in christ jesus
6926027 work out your own salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who is working in you enabling you both to will and to act for his good purpose
6926028 in pauls day it was also used for working a mine that is getting out of the mine all the valuable ore possible or working a field so as to get the greatest harvest possible
6926029 an exposition of the new testament comprising the entire be series
6926030 my goal is to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being conformed to his death
6926031 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith in the future there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me on that day and not only to me but to all those who have loved his appearing
6926032 for we know that if our earthly house a tent is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens and the one who prepared us for this very thing is god who gave us the spirit as a down payment
6926033 your heart must not be troubled believe in god believe also in me in my fathers house are many dwelling places if not i would have told you i am going away to prepare a place for you if i go away and prepare a place for you i will come back and receive you to myself so that where i am you may be also
6926034 therefore brothers by the mercies of god i urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual worship do not be conformed to this age but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may discern what is the good pleasing and perfect will of god
6926035 we need more than rhetoric to make progress in the next 12 to 18 months
6926036 there has been no single country that has spoken against an agreement in general
6926037 they would like to see it implemented in different ways but nobody has tried to kill the proposal off everyone wants it to happen
6926038 we feel extremely uncomfortable with the kind of sectoral approaches that are being discussed
6926039 to say i am pleased with the results is an understatement we were hoping for prices of up to 40 per cent lower than the current benchmark achieving around 50 per cent savings for the laptops is a phenomenal result this will really pave the way in helping our customers meet their savings targets
6926040 insight is delighted to be working with ogcbuying solutions and the wider public sector we are offering high specification lenovo laptops and pcs at hugely competitive prices we fully expect this to be of interest to buyers as there is no minimum order quantity
6926041 we need more than rhetoric to make progress in the next 12 to 18 months
6926042 there has been no single country that has spoken against an agreement in general
6926043 they would like to see it implemented in different ways but nobody has tried to kill the proposal off everyone wants it to happen
6926044 we feel extremely uncomfortable with the kind of sectoral approaches that are being discussed
6926045 this kind of basic analysis thats not supported by any evidence after two years is not going to assuage family members concerns
6926046 we are auctioning allowances on 25 september and are then doing it four times a year
6926047 we think that auctions are the most economic and fairest way to distribute the publics right to clean air
6926048 any discussion of the level of the cap is based on short term trends which are the weather and fuel switching and those trends can go up and down
6926049 we think the long term market stability is ensured by a reserve price so any discussion of over allocation is based on short term trends

6926059 the environment agency has no staff to oversee those who knowingly flout the weee directive he said
6926060 on the way they had been arguing with one another about who was the greatest
6926061 teacher we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he wasnt following us
6926062 if anyone wants to be first he must be last of all and servant of all
6926063 and if your hand causes your downfall cut it off it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and go to hell the unquenchable fire where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched and if your foot causes your downfall cut it off it is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell the unquenchable fire where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched and if your eye causes your downfall gouge it out it is better for you to enter the kingdom of god with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched
6926064 he burned incense in the valley of hinnom and burned his children in the fire imitating the detestable practices of the nations the lord had dispossessed before the israelites
6926065 their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched
6926066 as they leave they will see the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me for their maggots will never die their fire will never go out and they will be a horror to all mankind
6926067 and the king will answer them i assure you whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me then he will also say to those on the left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
6926068 for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life because of me and the gospel will save it for what does it benefit a man to gain the whole world yet lose his life what can a man give in exchange for his life for whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his father with the holy angels
6926069 the person who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me the person who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and whoever doesnt take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me
6926070 i assure you unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it remains by itself but if it dies it produces a large crop the one who loves his life will lose it and the one who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life if anyone serves me he must follow me where i am there my servant also will be if anyone serves me the father will honor him
6926071 you are obsessed with which one of you in going to be greatest in my kingdom you are bent out of shape because you are afraid someone who isnt a member of your club is going to do something that will steal my blessing which you jealously covet for yourselves you are totally missing what this business of following me is all about it is not about you your positions your ambitions or your turf i have a mission to accomplish through you but if you insist on holding on to these hindering attitudes you are going to hurt people instead of helping them you will end up being an exclusive little fraternity while i am talking about extending grace to people of every race language and culture i dont care how precious something is to you i dont care how ingrained an attitude of prejudice is it must go if you insist on holding onto anything that keeps you from hearing me and obeying me then you will end up on the garbage pile you will be useless to me
6926072 that is asking too much that kind of drastic action would cost me everything
6926073 jesus doesnt really mean that you have to be willing to undergo that kind of radical surgery
6926074 for everyone will be salted with fire salt is good but if the salt should lose its flavor how can you make it salty have salt among yourselves and be at peace with one another
6926075 but you be on your guard they will hand you over to sanhedrins and you will be flogged in the synagogues you will stand before governors and kings because of me as a witness to them
6926076 a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering service to god they will do these things because they havent known the father or me
6926077 when they heard these things they were enraged in their hearts and gnashed their teeth at him but stephen filled by the holy spirit gazed into heaven he saw gods glory with jesus standing at the right hand of god and he said look i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing at the right hand of god then they screamed at the top of their voices stopped their ears and rushed together against him they threw him out of the city and began to stone him and the witnesses laid their robes at the feet of a young man named saul they were stoning stephen as he called out lord jesus receive my spirit then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice lord do not charge them with this sin and saying this he fell asleep
6926078 then agrippa said to paul are you going to persuade me to become a christian so easily
6926079 you guys know all about the salt that comes from the area around the dead sea it is full of impurities and its flavor only lasts a little while once the sharp tang is gone it is worthless people throw it out and go looking for something else to make their meat taste better if you are going to depend on your own personalities and cleverness to attract people you will have them for a little while and then they will go after the next slick preacher who comes along if you are willing to be severed from yourselves and any hindering influence i will give you a strong enduring attractiveness that will draw people to gods amazing grace this will be the holy spirit indwelling you and working through you
6926080 which would you rather have an assist or a 3 pointer
6926081 he needs to be intelligent and have his teammates best interest at heart
6926082 have salt among yourselves and be at peace with one another
6926083 right now i want you to understand the importance of coming together as a team you have to watch each others backs you have to esteem one another you have to be as willing to assist as you are to score men you have to really love each other if you dont do that how do you expect to love unlovely people
6926084 now we ask you brothers to give recognition to those who labor among you and lead you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work be at peace among yourselves and we exhort you brothers warn those who are lazy comfort the discouraged help the weak be patient with everyone see to it that no one repays evil for evil to anyone but always pursue what is good for one another and for all
6926085 therefore brothers by the mercies of god i urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual worship do not be conformed to this age but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may discern what is the good pleasing and perfect will of god
6926086 nothing between my soul and my savior naught of this worlds delusive dream i have renounced all sinful pleasure jesus is mine theres nothing between
6926087 nothing between my soul and my savior so that his blessed face may be seen nothing preventing the least of his favor keep the way clear let nothing between
6926088 nothing between like worldly pleasure habits of life though harmless they seem must not my heart from him ever sever he is my all theres nothing between
6926089 nothing between like pride or station self or friends shall not intervene though it may cost me much tribulation i am resolved theres nothing between
6926090 nothing between eer many hard trials though the whole world against me convene watching with prayer and much self denial ill triumph at last theres nothing between
6926091 we dispatched an officer to the address and found a 5 foot to 6 foot alligator in the house
6926092 according to the owner he has had the alligator for five years obviously it came to him as a small alligator and has now certainly increased in size 5 foot to 6 foot is a pretty large alligator
6926093 ziggy is not somebody i would like to live next door to we certainly want to caution people that alligators and wild animals should be left in the wild they should be left to the care of those people that are well trained and experienced to keep those kinds of animals

6926098 i dont classify it as an injury something that needs to be healed it was tightness in both sides of his ribs it wasnt a strain it wasnt that he pulled anything it was something almost like a spasm in both sides of his ribs that needed to unspasm

6926121 divers are personally invested in the oceans and truly understand the importance of safeguarding marine wildlife and habitats
6926122 divers are avid participants in ecotourism and show a great willingness to protect all that inhabits the oceans
6926123 divers are great advocates for the oceans because they see first hand whats happening in the water
6926124 failure of ocean managers to decrease pressures from commercial fishing pollution and climate change continues to threaten the health and future of the worlds oceans
6926125 respaldamos la firma de nuestros gobernadores del jefe de gobierno capitalino y de los senadores
6926126 asistimos porque queremos ser parte de una ofensiva que en 100 d as tiene que dar sus primeros resultados y que en los pr ximos meses tiene que dar resultados mayores
6926127 the action will also include the secretary of state and the policing board who ultimately retain jurisdiction under section 6 of the police act to prevent their piloting and actual deployment from the outset a duty that they failed to discharge and which we believe will be a central feature of the forthcoming litigation
6926128 because these weapons are potentially lethal police officers must be trained to the same high standard as they are for using a firearm receiving intensive ongoing training to ensure that they only use these dangerous weapons in very limited circumstances
6926129 we are surprised that the police are deploying this weapon after only a two day training programme
6926130 considered that the ability of police to honour these policing obligations could be hindered by the release of information outlining training methodology
6926131 is this fashion still abundant or has it relatively died
6926132 tenho um grupo de trabalho e de acordo com as circunst ncias do jogo entra um ou outro

6926137 ser que a organizada mesmo quando fazem isso elas colocam os nomes delas e eu ouvi que a torcida prometeu estar ao nosso lado no domingo est o dando muito espa o sem saber se a origem a torcida motiva o pol tica um palmeirense desbaratinado ou algu m mandou fazer isso

6926144 its sexually graphic its very suggestive and it still would be if it were a man and a woman
6926145 may actually find it safer to send non dmca takedowns on the assumption probably correct that most service providers will treat them exactly the same
6926146 the court just assumed that even if it didnt hit all the criteria it was for all intents and purposes
6926147 looks like rather a huge assumption to make and why woud you make an assumption like that

6926155 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6926156 the second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6926157 and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6926173 she said what do you want on the poster and i said mmmm ok vote for bertha means the great grandmama for obama and you know people were lined up throughout the convention wanting photos of me
6926174 i really didnt know who that president was who was providing all the nice things for people who grew up underprivileged
6926175 and so i guess thats one of the reasons that i have loved the democratic party all my life because it is a party that cared a party working for change
6926176 and if theres a hillary supporter whos not for obama i would say this is the democratic party and we are together

6926197 how can i be successful and happy when my father always told me i wouldnt amount to much
6926198 my mother was never a role model for a happy healthy woman
6926199 no one ever showed me love when i was a child so how
6926200 that leads in my case and i would think in other cases as well that people say well lets just not reinsulate the roof
6926201 what we didnt know in july was that these cases were part of a larger ontario outbreak that only became known the end of july
6926202 we do that as a precaution when the cfia indicates that theyre doing a review or an investigation so that our food service distributers arent further putting that product into distribution
6926203 the issue with that is that this is a bacteria thats invisible
6926204 it doesnt take a lot its not like youre going to have dripping stuff all over the place it just happens to get in there despite having a very good system with a whole bunch of checks and balances
6926205 what we didnt know in july was that these cases were part of a larger ontario outbreak that only became known the end of july

6926208 it doesnt take a lot its not like youre going to have dripping stuff all over the place it just happens to get in there despite having a very good system with a whole bunch of checks and balances
6926209 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
6926210 helping me to take away your heart and your innocence
6926211 thats what they have done and i should thank them but i wont

6926213 ive had too much focus on keeping my family together and protecting my daughter fighting cancer for the last few years but now that this appears to be close to over im going to work on changing that
6926214 in ontario there are three confirmed deaths at this point linked to the investigation and another is still under investigation
6926215 there are some additional cases of listeria currently under investigation in quebec
6926216 we have one confirmed case of listeria thats associated with the provincial outbreak and that case is deceased
6926217 we have confirmed that the primary cause of death is listeriosis
6926218 what well find out is whether the illness and the meat were linked if its the same strain
6926219 weve put in place a new system that allows us to detect an outbreak and to see a pattern very early in the game
6926220 im glad we got hold of it early and now well take serious steps working with the feds to put it behind us
6926221 we then notified the canadian food inspection agency on aug 6 to tell them we had these positive food samples and the cfia then worked with us to collect further samples from the nursing home
6926222 it was based on the results of those early tests and as well based on communication that maple leaf foods put out to its distributors that we on august 14 asked the long term care facilities to put certain products on hold
6926223 well the protocol says up to 24 hours it can take the average is eight we did this one in five

6926226 for example after there was a sewage spill there was a lot of questions about how soon is it safe to go back into the water clearly very quickly the water gets mixed up but what happens to the sand what happens to the pollutants that cycle through the sand how quickly do those actually get through we dont have numbers
6926227 so we can hopefully say something about keeping things healthy keeping the reef healthy
6926228 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6926229 were number one how can we possibly lose unless we quit or those fill in your civilian quislings of choice stab us in the back

6926284 ik speel nu voor orion en met orion wil ik winnen dit is een heel lekkere seizoenstart we wisten dat we het heel zwaar zouden krijgen omdat nesselande veel wedstrijdritme heeft in de champions league ze wonnen dinsdag bijna van treviso ik had verwacht dat we het heel zwaar zouden krijgen

6926399 when such cases verbal abuse are reported we can only forward it to the education department for further action
6926400 however it would be difficult to charge a teacher suspected of racially abusing a student unless there is strong supporting evidence and witnesses who are willing to testify in court
6926401 despite the reports the teachers who allegedly abused the indian students verbally and physically continue to teach and no apparent action has been taken against them
6926402 on nov 16 last year a male teacher sent an open apology letter endorsed by the senior assistant of the school for his actions against a student and promised to change his behaviour
6926403 however because he was let off lightly he did not change his ways and this had resulted in a police report lodged against him on february 29 for abusing another indian student
6926404 the parents are disappointed as no disciplinary action has been taken against the teachers involved

6926434 in my opinion its now critically important to get into the real world and really challenge yourself expose yourself to risk put yourself in situations where you will succeed or fail by your own decisions and actions and where that success or failure will be highly visible by failure i dont mean getting a b or even a c but rather having your boss yell at you in front of your peers for screwing up a project launching a product and seeing it tank being unable to meet a ship date missing a critical piece of information in a financial report or getting fired why if youre going to be a high achiever youre going to be in lots of situations where youre going to be quickly making decisions in the presence of incomplete or incorrect information under intense time pressure and often under intense political pressure youre going to screw up frequently and the screwups will have serious consequences and youll feel incredibly stupid every time it cant faze you you have to be able to just get right back up and keep on going that may be the most valuable skill you can ever learn make sure you start learning it early

6926477 anyone whos moved into the no 1 spot must be doing something right
6926478 it was definitely shocking you see carpet everywhere you see nice buildings and you see people with nice cars
6926479 you look at every coachs history everywhere theyve been and try to tie some of that in there
6926480 but sometimes you can complicate things that way too there will be a lot of adjustments on game day
6926481 obviously wed love to redshirt him but im not sure he couldnt help us
6926482 the way i look at it at the air force academy it takes us all to make a one

6926495 be especially careful to keep your goal of application not interpretation only in mind when you do a word study

6926575 estamos comprometidos para intentar mejorar la manera en que respondemos a las preocupaciones y a las cr ticas sobre el fondo
6926576 reconocemos que para hacer esto tenemos que salir de washington y pensamos que la manera m s efectiva es traer los conocimientos de firmas del sector privado que ya tienen una reputaci n global

6926580 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so thought i would give it a shot and see if it works
6926581 we have a lot of points left in the game
6926582 we know what we need to do i think they have more to lose than us were going to be fighting
6926583 if there is one point between us even if at sometimes it looks impossible and right now its not even close were going to have the faith were going to continue working
6926584 joking aside the good news is nobody got hurt and things can definitely be replaced
6926585 but when you go back to the truck its hard to forget a lot of our tools that we would be able to use here are gone the good news is team penske is always prepared we already had a truck that came from charlotte stuff that well be able to use now
6926586 you just have to keep focused on what youre trying thats the biggest thing for us making sure that we make as many points as we can at any opportunity at least then you know youve done your best even if somebody takes you out of it
6926587 hes very competitive and penske is a team that has won many races a lot of championships a lot of indy 500s so theyve definitely got the equipment and the drivers to do it
6926588 look at helio hes come second seven times this year so easily he could have won some races hes on top of his game
6926589 the good news is that im very comfortable with the road courses
6926590 the bad news is he is also very comfortable with the road courses
6926591 this kind of basic analysis thats not supported by any evidence after two years is not going to assuage family members concerns

6926640 la decisi de sacrificar colin ha estat molt dura i emocional
6926641 she walks like greta garbo but she talks like yogi bear
6926642 the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle
6926643 the replacement of complex inner density with a new kind of self evolving under the pressure of information overload and the technology of the instantly available
6926644 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submission of proposals if we dont get sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres little option for us other than not to bid in this competition
6926645 really into this idea just as much as we were
6926646 everyone whos had a top 10 hit in the last 14 months is in there
6926647 its a confidential deal and the buyer wants anonymity but i can tell you it is not mr trump and its not john mccain
6926648 at this point im not sure i see a consensus for how the commission ends up addressing it
6926649 but this is cash money its a small boutique group of artists with a very similar fan base
6926650 theres a core group of consumers that associate with the specific cash money brand

6926657 i tried with all the models from the spacewar starter kit and they seem to all have the same problem the cockpit and engine exhausts never get the correct material texture lighting although the fuselage looks fine
6926658 all our objects are going to be lit and will be textured and will not use vertex colors
6926659 there has been an abuse of power by the state labour inspectorate
6926660 the inspection was not intended to serve the purpose of a full and comprehensive examination of compliance with labour legislation but rather was an attempt at all costs and as soon as possible to initiate the procedure to disqualify r w dudley
6926661 he was unable to appear due to having been invited at exactly the same time to attend the federal migration service of the russian federation for the purposes of extending his visa his non appearance would mean termination of the visa
6926662 the inspector knew that findings of violations would be made
6926663 the above circumstances are simply the most flagrant examples of the prejudicial attitude of the said officials to the inspection carried out in respect of ojsc
6926664 it doesnt matter which country a product comes from its an open market economy here now and i am not looking for a product from a certain place just because it comes from a rich country
6926665 what i buy has to be better than what we have here and also be cost effective
6926666 there was a time when all our industries were protected
6926667 the products were not as good because companies knew that people still had to buy them since the implementation of the free market after 1990 the economy has opened up and products have improved because of competition we have a choice now and that is good
6926668 when i arrived in bombay fifteen years ago i had nothing and nowhere to live so i stayed at the mercy of a friend
6926669 i got a job as a teacher and have made a lot of progress since then as have many of my classmates the last ten years have given us all a huge boost and i think nearly everyone in india believes that we are one of the worlds strongest emerging economies
6926670 having a television then was a luxury but today they are common the purchasing power of people has increased greatly for nearly every family now has a tv they also have mobile phones as well as a landline number it wasnt long ago people were using a telegraph service
6926671 of course there are still many people who are poor and dont have even the most basic necessities but you cannot expect the whole country to change within ten years it takes time
6926672 the extremes are still there but slowly it is changing
6926673 it is tremendous to see children reach out and want to become professionals
6926674 the way my children are growing up is radically different from the way i grew up they have opportunities that i did not have because their father has more money than their grandfather had
6926675 i hope they become professionals maybe in the it or healthcare sectors or perhaps they become engineers because there is huge scope for infrastructure developments here
6926676 thats not a target when that was said it was making the point that the in house arm could aspire to that thats not a target its more a balance supply for itv as with the bbc is governed by all sorts of things market forces as well as strategy
6926677 for broadcasters like itv its very important to maximise our own production capability while working with the best indies ive always believed in a mixed economy
6926678 summer exam results and the olympics created something of a distraction for our customers
6926679 the out of town stores had another poor week although the dotcom business showed good growth
6926680 more changeable weather should help encourage an increase in shopping activity and this coupled with the arrival of new autumn stock will provide lots of inspiration and choice
6926681 a recalculation of damages based upon the trial transcripts without having the opportunity to observe the witnesses would be a further miscarriage of justice
6926682 undertook a duty to meet the standard of care with respect to the examination and any recommendations as a result thereof
6926683 reaffirms the position that if you see a patient once and give bad advice you cant claim theyre not your patient
6926684 our banking is sub sub sub sub prime you cant get any lower than us we have no collateral no insurance no taxpayer guarantees and no lawyers in our system
6926685 yet we have a loan repayment rate of over 98pc our model has never faltered over the years
6926686 the worlds big banks had all the collateral all the guarantees all the lawyers and what did they do they sent us a 1 trillion bill
6926687 we send our people out on bicycles to check if they are poor enough if a woman lives in a one room house she qualifies if she has a leaky roof she qualifies we even give loans to beggars this is risky
6926688 the banks gave the impression that they were almost perfect and then we find there is a fundamental flaw in the structure of the system
6926689 we dont seem to be accusing anybody over this whole debacle it is as if nobody is responsible we can all go off and play golf the taxpayer will take care of the problem when things go well the bankers take the profit and when it goes wrong they are compensated this is not symmetrical
6926690 the next thing we are going to see is a micro finance bubble the players are becoming bigger and bigger weve now got hedge funds and mutual funds going around saying this is a wonderful idea you can make so much money and help people at the same time its intoxicating
6926691 we dont like them this is an abuse of the whole philosophy of micro finance
6926692 this is about getting people out of poverty it is a non loss non dividend company with a social objective it is totally de linked from the profit system
6926693 women have a feature of self sacrifice for the family that you see all over the world men like to spend
6926694 the extreme right religious groups accused us of destroying the social order by giving loans to women we were encouraging them to disobey their husbands they were using religion for what was really a male issue
6926695 there is nothing in the koran against women being in business the prophet mohammad married a businesswoman
6926696 the left didnt like us either they said this was an american conspiracy to spread capitalism at the grass roots level so we were squeezed from all sides let them all scream the revolutionaries are all talk and do nothing
6926697 we sell in the cheapest possible way with no frills hoping that enough of it will reach poor children
6926698 so far 11 000 have stopped begging completely and the other 90 000 are now part time beggars they know when to sell and which houses are a soft touch for begging this is good market segmentation it takes time to close down a core business
6926699 i believe all people are entrepreneurs poverty is not inherent it is artificially imposed by the denial of opportunities
6926700 we are excited by this unique opportunity to create a powerful global franchise the offer provides fair and certain value to our shareholders
6926701 if you look at benfields recent results there are certain areas where they have just scratched the surface despite their best efforts like the us division the corporate risks division has also been making consistent losses in recent years so i would expect those divisions to be looked at if the deal is completed
6926702 in fact there are many more sets of eyes on the highway everyday and that may actually lead to an increase in the number of impaired driving convictions
6926703 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6926704 there are a handful of insurers that have pretty decent exposure to fannie and freddie equity
6926705 frequently the subject of speculation about our future plans and it is our policy that we do not comment on rumors
6926706 fuel costs are a challenge for us and the industry as a whole but they could cause more people to utilise public transport in the future
6926707 spending behind the us presidential election and around the beijing olympic games should continue to boost 2008 revenues however the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the us and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6926708 we have done well on that but there are so many issues to handle now were getting into all the other things we have to do
6926709 we have identified all of the issues but i cant be confident that we have quantified them
6926710 as of what i had heard this morning every single person had been at least left a message to call us
6926711 but more than half of them had been reached directly
6926712 we have work for our first years when they get here
6926713 like many firms were taking steps to manage our expenses
6926714 russians have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
6926715 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6926716 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6926717 mr mangan has finally fully and completely been vindicated in this matter
6926718 both of the secs claims have now been dismissed as a matter of law and the judge found there was not even a factual dispute related to these claims
6926719 indiana thinks that in person verification with photo id helps to reduce cheating on legal rules for both buying wine and voting and perhaps other subjects
6926720 it would be awfully hard to take judicial notice that in person verification with photo id has no effect on wine fraud and therefore flunks the interstate commerce clause
6926721 can get beer locally may not want to pay for costly upmarket wine plus shipping charges
6926722 systematically and deliberately commingled client money and appropriated it for his own purposes
6926723 in spite of mr mcintyres insistence that no client ever lost a dime this is not the standard
6926724 the supreme court has stated that the moment the lawyer succumbs to a temptation to appropriate for his own use any of his clients money entrusted to his safekeeping is the moment he shows his unfitness to be a practicing lawyer
6926725 gratified by the court of appeals decision today upholding the district courts decision in the pcaobs favor
6926726 highly effective organization whose continued existence is vital to protecting investors and furthering the public interest in the preparation of accurate and informative audit reports
6926727 the supreme court has long recognized that some types of restrictions on presidential authority within the executive branch are permissible especially in the case of independent agencies
6926728 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6926729 criminalize conduct wildly beyond the sweep of the mail wire fraud laws
6926730 the same office that was simultaneously attempting to place one of its own prosecutors in the office formerly occupied by judge blitch
6926731 by attempting to insert ausa johstono into judge blitchs former position the government has done more than attempt to set standards for good government of local and state officials
6926732 since the alleged victim of the fraud in this case the citizens of the state of georgia were well aware of mr suttons relationship to judge blitch and voiced no complaints about it neither they nor the united states attorneys office have the right to complain about it now much less base criminal charges on a breach of fiduciary duty theory
6926733 and that is true from the president of the united states to the mayor of the smallest hamlet
6926734 courts have refused to allow the mail and wire fraud statutes to become a broad method of federalizing all violations of state law
6926735 counsel has found no case where the department of justice has ever prosecuted a criminal case based upon a judicial order that it contends was without legal authority this is an expansion of the mail fraud statute that cannot stand
6926736 prosecuting the judges for the issuance of erroneous orders is unheard of
6926737 criminalize a citizens pejorative comment regarding the performance of official duties by a public officer
6926738 she elevated the quality of life of these dogs above the safety of their neighbors
6926739 there is some relief some closure here but we still have the sentencing
6926740 the barack obama and john mccain campaigns have agreed to hold three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate in september and october sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the campaigns have come to the earliest agreement on presidential debates reached in any general election in recent history this announcement reflects the presidential campaigns agreement on dates locations and the formats for the fall debates campaign appointed debate negotiators house democratic caucus chairman rahm emanuel d il and senator lindsey graham r sc said they were pleased to have reached an early agreement to provide the american people with the opportunity to see and hear the candidates debate the critical issues facing the country the two campaigns have accepted sponsorship of the debates by the commission on presidential debates subject to the debates being conducted under the terms of their agreement
6926741 the parties have recommenced discussions to determine whether a negotiated resolution may obviate the need for continued litigation
6926742 reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care transportation and other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense
6926743 our conclusion follows from the plain language of the statute
6926744 that language gives the district courts broad authority to determine which of the victims expenses may be appropriately included in a restitution order
6926745 general terms that follow specific ones are interpreted to embrace only objects of the same kind or class as the specific ones
6926746 it is true that our interpretation of the statute renders congress reference to a child care and transportation expenses somewhat superfluous
6926747 confronted the same dilemma and did not find it to be a sufficient reason standing alone to invoke ejusdem generis
6926748 the court reasoned that congress might sometimes use specific terms not to limit the succeeding general ones but instead simply to remove any doubt that the specific terms are included under the statute
6926749 this reasoning is especially appropriate to 3663a b 4 the drafters of which may have feared courts would overlook child care and transportation expenses unless these items were specifically named
6926750 such fears would not likely have extended to attorneys and accounting costs because these expenses are so obviously associated with investigation and prosecution particularly in the case of fraud offenses
6926751 it should be cert worthy because even as the second circuit noted the other circuits are all over the map on this either they havent taken a position or they have issued contradictory opinions
6926752 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

6926759 the college admissions process is an initiation rite into adulthood
6926760 but if success is defined very narrowly such as a fat envelope from a specific college then many kids end up going through it and feeling like a failure
6926761 but some of these kids have had college on the brain since sixth or seventh grade or even earlier when you have that kind of stress over that kind of time thats where it starts to worry us

6926777 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads
6926778 from the day we went to school we learned nothing on the contrary we were made obtuse we were wrapped in a fog of words and abstractions
6926779 ive always said that theres nothing an atheist cant do if hes really unsure whether he believes anything or not

6926917 washington reuters in a sharp turnaround republican john mccain has opened a 5 point lead on democrat barack obama in the u s presidential race and is seen as a stronger manager of the economy according to a reuters zogby poll released on wednesday
6926918 mccain leads obama among likely u s voters by 46 percent to 41 percent wiping out obamas solid 7 point advantage in july and taking his first lead in the monthly reuters zogby poll
6926919 the reversal follows a month of attacks by mccain who has questioned obamas experience criticized his opposition to most new offshore oil drilling and mocked his overseas trip
6926920 the latest zogby poll reinforces what earlier la times bloomberg and pew polls have found barack obama has had a collapse this summer being zogby it has a more dramatic collapse than the others obama led john mccain in zogbys july poll 47 40 but now trails 46 41 a 15 point swing
6926921 this table shows obamas loss of support between the july and august reuters zogby polls among some significant sub groups the margin of error is greater for sub groups than the sample as a whole
6926922 they told the stories at times they had personally raped cut off ears cut off heads taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power cut off limbs blown up bodies randomly shot at civilians razed villages in fashion reminiscent of genghis khan shot cattle and dogs for fun poisoned food stocks and generally ravaged the countryside of south vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country

6926927 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6926928 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6926929 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6926930 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6926931 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6926932 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6926933 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person

6926935 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6926936 has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6926937 has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6926938 were monitoring closely and will have something to say when an agreement is finalised
6926939 at this point obama looks a little less reckless than he might have a few months ago
6926940 i dont think this gets the issue off the table
6926941 between now and election day not a lot of troops are going to come home
6926942 has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6926943 this is unfortunately a run of the mill child pornography case

6926945 this morning was an opportunity for him to come before an english court and english justice for the first time and make these points
6926946 unfortunately the court did not agree to my submission that the court should hear about the unfairness of his treatment at the hands of the vietnamese justice system
6926947 mr gadd wants through me to say to you that he did not commit the offences of which he was convicted in vietnam it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his case forward
6926948 why should it be this is a problem that is a fijian problem
6926949 it is all the fijian political parties all the registered political parties will participate and discuss the electoral reform that has been suggested
6926950 are we going to be bullied and pressured into doing things that are clearly not in our national interest
6926951 without the threat of losing its clientele to competitors many schools and school districts behave like the monopolies they are focused on strengthening the organizations position and goals rather than meeting the needs of students and parents genuine accountability to parents begins with school choice
6926952 it was a very poor blossom set for us this spring the bees that we have back there werent out pollinating because of the cold wet spring and as i said we pruned a great deal so there were fewer blossoms to start with
6926953 it keeps going down so for our boats everything takes a lot longer
6926954 on the positive side more stuff is exposed for us to get so i guess it works both ways
6926955 its the roofs the trusses the 2x4s the electrical box and electrical wires and the structure itself
6926956 it gets caught up in a log jam so its all mangled
6926957 its kind of all held together by the internal wiring and board by board piece by piece piece of carpet or whatever it is we load up the boats one by one
6926958 its about a foot and a half if that by the debris
6926959 we really need all the water we can get whether its rain or water from the upper reservoirs
6926960 we need rain but we dont need 14 inches in two days or something like that
6926961 its kind of weird to pick up pieces of peoples lives
6926962 this stuff roofing trusses doesnt mean much until you see those little photographs see a little bottle of perfume a little pink shoe about this long or somebodys slippers
6926963 over here we had this little kangaroo those things remind you that its husbands wives and children involved
6926964 it brain continually adjusts to weakness makes you work harder and harder
6926965 the ability to readapt when it loses certain functions reacquire those skills retrain areas of the brain to handle those things
6926966 it isnt a place to sit around and play cards or knit or just sit around theres so much going on
6926967 classes for brain activity because you dont want to sit around and do nothing
6926968 it is possible to exercise the brain muscle and enhance the cognitive fitness thats good news and why its an important topic right now
6926969 what better part of successful aging than keeping your cognitive fitness
6926970 its a very interesting programme and many of my seniors gave it the thumbs up
6926971 my name was not on the list but im very interested but i have to get my parents permission first as they may have other plans for me
6926972 does the world need another electric guitar does taylor really want to risk its stellar rep in the acoustic world by trespassing into the parallel universe of electric solidbodies
6926973 the world has become more and more flat with cultural currency and trade barriers becoming less and less with the advent of the european union the adoption of a common currency and the free movement of goods across borders a huge opportunity has been created to do more commerce at a higher level
6926974 fender has proven the concept of an american guitar and amp company successfully exporting their business model to europe and achieving much higher sales and brand awareness as a result
6926975 bill mendello shared his experiences in creating fender europe with me a few years ago and invited me to see their european operations first hand i spent a week visiting their warehouse sales offices and even their d sseldorf custom shop showroom i was blown away by their incredible success in europe and the huge potential of their sales model for taylor
6926976 we are extremely pleased to be working closely with bob taylor and kurt listug two admired industry leaders who have built taylor into a premier guitar brand
6926977 by providing our expertise in sales marketing warehousing and logistics we look forward to enhancing their success throughout the european market
6926978 watching customers move so effortlessly between acoustics and electrics brought home the fact that these worlds really do converge
6926979 thats obvious to most players but as a manufacturer with a largely singular focus up until now it definitely hit home
6926980 the neck was spectacular the walnut was unbelievable and the sound of those pickups was to die for im just a straight garage church playing rhythm guy not tommy shaw by any stretch of the imagination but im very picky about the sound of the guitar and the overall presentation and feel of playing i congratulate everyone at taylor who put the solidbody together i think its probably the ultimate electric guitar
6926981 im very impressed with this little white stallion ive been using it in my home studio and its just beautiful the simplicity of the five way switch and controls is wonderful and the taylor neck what can you say about that if you cant play barre chords on a taylor guitar quit playing
6926982 in the past two months i have been fortunate enough to purchase a taylor t5 custom and a taylor solidbody classic
6926983 after plugging it in i bought the classic the statement in the review about taylor reinventing the electric guitar was not overstated this guitar does it all
6926984 bob and his crew are always tinkering with new ideas
6926985 some of them rise to the surface and some of them dont there wasnt a plan to make a solid body electric we dont want to make something unless its original unless we think weve added value
6926986 but i got convinced that these guitars were really special and that the positive feedback we were getting meant we should do it yes the whole guitar market is very crowded now compared with when we started in 1974 now there are zillions of brands but most of them are me too products with very little innovation in my opinion and we think theres always room for original ideas
6926987 the campbells had seen the solidbody at the taylor road show we had in october
6926988 theyd been badgering us ever since when are they coming in when are they coming in we were joking with them about the way the final harry potter book was released with bookstores opening up at midnight so that kids could get it as soon as it went on sale
6926989 they left the store that day but they called us a little later asking how serious we were about opening at midnight my dad and i looked at each other and said lets just do it so after thanksgiving dinner and watching football we came back up here about ten minutes to twelve we put some christmas music on turned on our christmas lights and they met us at about five til they bought the standard model my dad waited until 12 01 a m to print the invoice and we snapped some pictures we hope they were the first people to buy a solidbody
6926990 he asked that we save all the original packaging for the 2007 pre launch solidbody guitars
6926991 he wants the original boxes because down the road they will add to their value
6926992 you tore that song up that song is yours now
6926993 i had a ton of compliments on the look and sound of this guitar its simply an excellent guitar the pickups had a classic humbucker sound but it was nice and light with just the right amount of jangle and character as far as the way it played well its a taylor it plays amazing the world needs to know about this guitar
6926994 were looking forward to getting our next re load because weve only got one solidbody left out of our three
6926995 as soon as taylor released information that there was going to be a solid body electric our phones started ringing
6926996 we think its going to be the guitar of the year 2008
6926997 i have them customers are playing them it was really loud in here this morning i havent even plugged in a custom though since my customs are pre sold i spent two minutes with one showing it to a customer then i put it back in the box because he bought it
6926998 ill probably get around to playing one sometime next year when the excitement has died down a little
6926999 i love everything about this guitar ive been a gibson guy my whole life ive got 32 les pauls and this is my main guitar now
6927000 you can actually get a lot of different sounds from the gibson sound to the strat anything
6927001 and sounds that dont even sound like either of them
6927002 thats what really makes them special theres so many unique sounds working with your volume and your tone that you get can a very unique sound going and with these pickups here referring to frenchs standard you can get the big big crunch that you like plus for a guitar thats lighter than im used to they have just as much punch youll see in a little bit they want us to rock today so were turning it up
6927003 the first time i plugged mine in and roi elam our other guitarist plugged his in we just started laughing hysterically because of how good it sounded
6927004 the bridge is so perfect for your wrist or palm the neck just feels great the weight is awesome everything just really seems like it was thought out for the guitarists
6927005 you know how a lot of times when you get a new guitar you put it on and it feels foreign as soon as i put this guitar on it felt like id been playing it for like 10 years
6927006 the standard to me just fits what i do i think theyre all great its just a matter of personal taste which is the cool thing about the fact that yall have three different models you can kind of find one that fits your style and flavor
6927007 the body contours are great the bridge is really comfortable theres no risk of stabbing your hand with a screw sticking up
6927008 its a beautiful guitar i have no complaints to me an instrument should just be a tool for you to be creative and you do feel creative when you pick up that guitar
6927009 the coolest thing about that guitar also is the 5 way switch and the way the humbuckers are split
6927010 you get some really unique tones and when youre doing rolling picking things like doyle dykes its just so articulate a lot of note separation its a phenomenal sounding guitar
6927011 when i plugged it in the sound was just humongous
6927012 but if you break my heart or hurt my feelings i will write a song about you
6927013 theyre the only acoustic guitars that actually stay in tune especially when you capo them
6927014 the most rewarding moment for me is when someone comments on how beautiful and functional our namm room is
6927015 invariably they will ask me who designs your room for you
6927016 it comes through in his fluid style speed and technical ability it was like a cutting edge blues fusion jazz rock style and that was what caught my ear the most about him that and the fact that his playing had more fire and passion than i had ever heard to that point regardless of the style that really got me plus how easy he made it look
6927017 when i put this guitar a classic on my rig it was just strong it really popped
6927018 it took me three years of auditions but i finally became a dancer at wonderland
6927019 after my second year at chiropractic college i took a sabbatical to study dance intensively in new york and los angeles i made a lot of sacrifices to take classes in new york i lived on one meal a day and in los angeles i slept in my car
6927020 i went in without any inhibitions and took real chances
6927021 my parents just didnt get it that i would give up school for dance but when i brought them to new york to see the show they were impressed
6927022 i had no aspirations for leading roles because while i did study voice i wasnt a great singer what i became was a great featured dancer because i danced my butt off i knew fosse would be my last show as a performer because i was ready to move on something creative was missing and i wanted to be a choreographer
6927023 that jersey boys would go on to greatness we pulled the show together in three weeks but it was magical the way it all gelled im really proud of the show because it is good theatre and so wonderfully creative
6927024 i want my story to get out there because im living my dream somewhere in canada there is an immigrant kid who thinks he has a handicap because his family is starting from scratch i want them to know that everything is possible
6927025 achieved something that not many other sides have been able to achieve
6927026 paul roos i think is a very good coach outside of the fact hes also a decent bloke
6927027 hes got a team that has performed very very well playing a certain role for five or six years so if theyre changing their game plans or strategies because of us weve achieved something that not many other sides have been able to achieve
6927028 its not as if were going to be sitting on our hands thinking that they wont change but well have a look at what they do and hopefully our players can address any issues that come up because weve spoken about them
6927029 adam goodes can play anywhere and hes a good player so well worry about that when he starts
6927030 the past is the past it serves you well when you want it to serve you
6927031 we know how we played in the past but thats yesterday and tomorrows the game so youve just got to get ready if youve got confidence from previous games maintain that but dont let that get in the way of the intensity thats required
6927032 were not in the finals yet round 22 tells you whos in the finals
6927033 were not about to start jumping up and down and saying were going to
6927034 we are still one of the clubs in the eight currently that can slip out and theres two sides now who are out of the eight who could go into the eight
6927035 if we make the eight youd love to think that your back up crew are also playing the instance with anthony is the classical one but you can still fit a lot of work into people on the training track they obviously lack match practice but you try to simulate that with the players that are left over
6927036 any of the emergencies are a chance to play thats why you name them
6927037 the purpose of mxtabs is to allow musicians to freely share their knowledge and to participate in a community with other musicians
6927038 the rebirth of mxtabs was done with the direct input of previous users of the site and what weve built is directly based on what musicians have been asking us for
6927039 were excited to see how fans and musicians get behind this competition
6927040 bands receive top of the line gear from taylor and a load of cash while fans get a live show from the winning band in their city everyone wins weve learned that fans love it when an opportunity arises for them to truly show support for their favorite bands the element of fan participation and advocacy will only enhance the opportunity for emerging artists to showcase their talent by way of a game changing music industry tool like eventful demand
6927041 we love helping build stronger connections between fans and artists
6927042 were excited to work with the taylor guitars to give the fans the power to shape their favorite artists tours
6927043 the challenge isnt in making a quiet single coil but to do it without losing the single coils tonal character using our flavor of design we did that and on top of it we were able to maintain what we call a modern output level
6927044 ive owned probably three or four strat style guitars in my life ive built two or three for myself but they werent my main axe
6927045 a lot of it was because i only found that sound usable for my style of playing here and there but when we did these single coils and got them up and running i found something i really liked i like the power and the edge and the fidelity
6927046 i think your standard single coil player will find something extremely appealing that he hasnt heard before and i think the guy who normally plays full shred humbuckers will find fresh inspiration
6927047 im leaving the guitar wide open while im playing but theres no noise
6927048 you can turn the volume control down and the tone will clean up so its a real versatile guitar without any of the traditional hum and buzz and artifacts of a regular single coil
6927049 i did a session the other day where we had to replicate all these old popular songs from the 70s and i took both the humbucker and the single coil classic and used them both a lot theyre really really versatile the single coil sounds great plays great
6927050 looking for information about phuket youve come to the right place
6927051 i had no idea what would become of that precious remaining wood but i couldnt bring myself to throw it away
6927052 we locked it up and moved on to other projects
6927053 its an honor to be able to use the last few pieces of this important tree to make something as totally cool as this guitar
6927054 go this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the gentiles and their kings and before the people of israel 16 i will show him how much he must suffer for my name
6927055 go south to the road the desert road that goes down from jerusalem to gaza
6927056 tell me please who is the prophet talking about himself or someone else
6927057 i love everything about this guitar ive been a gibson guy my whole life ive got 32 les pauls and this is my main guitar now
6927058 id auditioned about seven times and atom finally called to say youre doing well
6927059 recalls bostick who started acting at 10 and has recently appeared in jeremy podeswas
6927060 i thought i was sunk that hed go with an american when my agent called to say id actually got the part i was shocked adoration has been the hardest and most rewarding project ive done so far i learned so much
6927061 i dont think ive been on a casting search for an unknown this wide perhaps since felicias journey when we found elaine cassidy who hails from county wicklow ireland we looked across the country we looked at hundreds of kids coming from everywhere but devon in the end felt absolutely right
6927062 hes very bright but theres also a quality to him that is unpredictable yet compelling hes not too smart for his own good and yet he reads with intelligence that was crucial for this role i felt if the character in any way seemed to understand the implications of what he was doing the tone of the film would have been wildly different
6927063 a lot of kids are very used to the performing aspects of their personality which can become quite cloying at a certain point but there was something very genuine about him
6927064 the part that made me all messed up and all jittery was all the interviews and the press
6927065 that really took me out of my element its weird being on the spot i remember walking the red carpet and looking up at the big screen and thinking hey i am walking it was so surreal once the trip ended i was like did i just do that it never really registered it all just went by so fast
6927066 we have the whole family going we could make an army
6927067 but i want to do it because i get a feeling that i dont really get from anything else and the final product is always worth it
6927068 i like the subtleties i get to play in film and tv roles commercials are far from that maybe ill do more of that kind of work when i get older and actually need the money to live on my own
6927069 growing up in a show business family through osmosis you pick it up hes clearly a bright kid too
6927070 and he knows the ins and outs of the business hes very pragmatic about it
6927071 its a person whose life was cut short so when we first see him in the session the lead character has travelled back to the past and sees her brother it needed to be a moment where theres an instant moment of incredible connection between the two devon has a real depth as an actor hes an old soul so he can tap into that kind of expression very easily
6927072 that got me to the toronto film festival the first time
6927073 again they were looking for someone completely different i did my audition involving mime it was completely wacko and something i would never do again i dont know what caught their attention but i do know the director was actually afraid of having me on set if i actually acted like that it was a big worry
6927074 cake ice cream cake skor flavoured those dairy queen ones
6927075 when mordecai died he was under contract to do a fourth jacob two two book and wed talked about all kinds of permutations everything you can possibly imagine he also left 14 pages of a manuscript and the book was about the stanley cup and it was certainly fabulous it was vintage mordecai no question about that
6927076 lowinger phoned me up one day and said i have this amazing proposal for you and told me about it and my jaw sort of dropped its not something i would have ever thought of happening
6927077 it doesnt please everyone that someone else will be writing another jacob two two book however were all just privileged that its happening if one really wants to read mordecai richler you go to the bookshelves or you go to the library so it really doesnt in any way harm him
6927078 the first book has a great deal of charm to it which is very richlerian and could i capture some of that
6927079 his books are full of incident and if he wants to end something and jump somewhere else he just does it he does whatever he pleases
6927080 if somebody buys a hat in act 1 hes going to use a hat to smack someone in act 3
6927081 i quite liked the idea i was filling in a part of the story that hadnt been told
6927082 preening self aggrandizing vain selfish and two faced behaviour that adults often practise
6927083 sophie my 11 year old didnt even let me finish high seas before she just took the pages from my desk and not only started reading it but also started copy editing it
6927084 for years bob taylor fended off the question when are you going to build a solidbody guitar
6927085 then as part of the general process of exploration and experimentation that goes on at the company
6927086 longtime employee david hosler devised a new pickup instead of dropping it in yet another strat or les paul clone hosler and bob taylor agreed the new pickup demanded a new guitar
6927087 what they came up with is the solidbody series with variations dubbed classic custom and standard all are flat front single cutaway guitars with two pickups a standard taylor c shaped neck the same used on their acoustics a 24 7 8
6927088 the basic shape of the taylor solidbodies is captivating and they are also extremely comfortable to hold and play
6927089 the bridge common to all three models is cast aluminum with an art deco appearance designed to remain free of sharp edges
6927090 the neck is attached with taylors proprietary t lock system where an allen bolt goes through the body and pulls the neck into a pocket shaped like a w the t lock neck system is so tight that viewed from any angle but the back the neck appears to be glued on the body
6927091 sonically the five way blade switch in position one on the classic the least expensive of the group offers a warm jazzy tone with just a little more treble edge than a traditional humbucker dialing up a mild overdrive from a tube amp the neck pickup gives off a deep throaty growl with a hint of that magic steel on glass tone of a great stratocaster type pickup in position two the classic solves that age old problem of adjusting for too much low end when you go from lead to rhythm its open airy sound is still distinctly electric but wont muddy up the mix
6927092 the central position adds midrange and lower mids offering a deeper more forceful rhythm sound that is still unobtrusive position five both coils in the bridge pickup dishes out a tone very reminiscent of a telecaster though not quite as bright or with the same edge
6927093 backing up a notch to position four takes the tone of the bridge only spot on the blade and boosts it with lower mids and adds just a hint of cluck in other words a great lead tone
6927094 i am leaving for hawaii with my family and the timing couldnt have been more perfect as i wanted to take a guitar with me on the plane and to the islands
6927095 a solid body is chambered typically where the controls are but finding those areas and chambering correctly is tricky
6927096 sustain and bloom are hard to get when everythings locked down but if you chamber too much you go in the opposite direction it blooms too soon and basically starts to resonate
6927097 but this is cash money its a small boutique group of artists with a very similar fan base
6927098 theres a core group of consumers that associate with the specific cash money brand

6927116 why yes i am a god why do you ask
6927117 i started looking at what a stylist has to offer what secrets we can let the world in on
6927118 i knew that andrea was the one who really created all those images to get those people to the place where they could do clothing deals
6927119 it was not just because they were famous it was because they had fans and those fans liked the way they looked and wanted to look like them
6927120 all these things weve been incubating for the last two years are starting to come out
6927121 seeing what janet was doing with the control and rhythm nation albums i was in awe i could see the difference in who people are in real life and the image they create for the public and all the reasons why its important
6927122 gretchen whats something you know now about happiness that you didnt know when you were 18 years old darren i would say that i now believe that happiness is more than just a feeling that i have sure there are times when it is feeling related but for me im beginning to discover that happiness is also about the way i live my life i find it hard to articulate ask me again when im 50 and i might have the answer but for me its also about an attitude or a choice that i have the opportunity to make daily when i was 18 i think i allowed my circumstances to dictate my happiness these days i bring happiness to my circumstances
6927123 happiness is also about the way i live my life
6927124 what you do every day matters more than what you do once in a while
6927125 i dont know whats happening but hes a fantastic player and every coach in the world wants him
6927126 one player is not going to make a difference to whether we win or lose but i like his style we need someone who can make a difference so that we can change our system when we need to if we only have one system its easier for the opposition
6927127 ive told the president the directors and the coach i want to play in the premier league chelsea have a great squad my personal aim is to be the best player in the world and that isnt going to be possible at real madrid
6927128 i have an opinion and i give that to the board
6927129 frank has been happy in training and knows very well what his position is here this sort of thing is normal in football whether you are a player or a coach
6927130 we are putting in place superb facilities that the public can use afterwards
6927131 the games will inspire people and we are ahead of schedule to ensure we leave behind a legacy of participation
6927132 pools have been closing in some boroughs and we need to rectify that
6927133 we need to get the facilities up to scratch thats what will make sure people inspired by the games will keep coming back
6927134 it will be unbelievably sad if we dont grasp this incredible opportunity for a legacy of participation
6927135 we have to get people taking part and to do that we have to give them the facilities that will make them want to keep coming back
6927136 one of the ohio state university football teams in this case the columbus branch they wanted to hear what they said hoping to get leads hoping they would slip up
6927137 im in this race to stay im in this race to win
6927138 in the end biden may be remembered as the candidate who truly offered the voters an echo and not a choice
6927139 im going back to gary hart at least he didnt steal that girl from some far lefty in england
6927140 so my advice to candidates like joe biden is this do justly love perorations and walk humbly with thy speechwriter
6927141 times have changed you cant get away with borrowing anything these days not even an oratorical technique much less a phrase or paragraph unless you are willing to give the attribution
6927142 the international olympic committee themselves recognize that beijing is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
6927143 produce an austerity games we are not going to run things down
6927144 were being asked to deliver it in a credit crunch
6927145 these games were an absolutely unique experience this was the worlds biggest country presenting itself on the world stage
6927146 its forcing them to consider just what their priorities are
6927147 east london is very very depressed by western european standards
6927148 if you create a pleasant waterway in a major modern city we all know what happens
6927149 yeah i 100 percent admit it was my fault i should have paid it
6927150 i cant really blame the cops they were doing what they had to do
6927151 i think were back where we were last year toward the end of spring
6927152 no matter how mature i think i can be im only 16
6927153 i gave a lot of stress to the school by leaving i will stay the year
6927154 this day is holy to the lord your god do not mourn or weep
6927155 ukraine images from 5000 to 4000 bc treasures of the trypillian culture
6927156 when i started shooting bankrupt offices i found it to be more archeology than photography everywhere i went i found signs of life interrupted
6927157 if the amityville horror had been a black family that whole movie would have been about three minutes
6927158 oh baby this house is beeee yootiful nice neighborhood everything
6927159 well that sho was nice yall better get to packin isss time to go
6927160 folksy people are dumb and if we all just believe in each other well win
6927161 if youre gonna fail fail big and you wont fail
6927162 youd better keep your head down or youre gonna get smoted
6927163 you should be consuming bullys comics content on the regular
6927164 why isnt a little stuffed bull running the comics industry
6927165 technology is anything invented after you were born everything else is just stuff
6927166 its not what the software does its what the user does
6927167 the technology itself is not transformative its the school the pedagogy that is transformative
6927168 we shape our tools and afterwards our tools shape us
6927169 any smoothly functioning technology will have the appearance of magic
6927170 our system of education is locked in a time capsule you want to say to the people in charge
6927171 communications tools dont get socially interesting until they get technologically boring
6927172 indeed the role i give the computer is that of a carrier of cultural germs or seeds whose intellectual products will not need technological support once they take root in an actively growing mind
6927173 the illiterate of the 21st century wont be those who cant read amp write but those who cant learn unlearn amp relearn
6927174 the b e s t conversations i have had with the people who know the most about tech has never been about tech
6927175 we already knew that kids learned computer technology more easily than adults it is as if children were waiting all these centuries for someone to invent their native language
6927176 why shouldnt we give our teachers a license to obtain software all software any software for nothing does anyone demand a licensing fee each time a child is taught the alphabet william gibson
6927177 you must be the change you want to see in the world
6927178 hay que ir a proponer el juego no podemos ir a encerrarnos y esperar una descolgada para hacer un gol
6927179 tenemos que ir a buscar el juego all como siempre lo intentamos hacer ir a buscar el resultado porque esperando un contra golpe es muy dif cil poder ganar
6927180 puede ser que est a favor por ah el cansancio pero igual tenemos que mentalizarnos en que vamos a enfrentar un buen equipo que tambi n va a venir con ganas de hacer bien las cosas
6927181 nosotros necesitamos ganar necesitamos sumar de a tres y que mejor ahora con cruz azul

6927189 as que vamos de menor a mayor y vamos sumando que es lo m s importante as que con san luis vamos con el objetivo de ganar el objetivo de los tres puntos
6927190 tuvimos una semana donde trabajamos para corregir algunas cosas y obviamente hay que cortar esta senda de derrotas con un resultado importante porque se viene una semana trascendental ellos juegan bien y dejan jugar y saldr un lindo partido pero para nosotros lo m s importante es conseguir un gran resultados y viene una semana de nueve puntos y tenemos que conseguir una buena cantidad para encaminarnos otra vez
6927191 se molest pero no platicamos sobre eso de la ausencia a la pr ctica platicamos del trabajo estamos pensando en el torneo ah estamos queremos ser protagonistas y eso es lo que nos debe preocupar
6927192 lo dem s lo vamos a arreglar como siempre se arreglan las cosas en el vestidor pero primero es el equipo el funcionamiento y hacer bien las cosas
6927193 primero es el equipo y la gente que va a jugar o la que no juega l la volpe va a tomar la decisi n por el bien del equipo

6927201 were thrilled and honored to host such an enormously influential pioneer of dance music here in los angeles
6927202 and she started telling jane about her split with john
6927203 but he listened very intently and tried to comfort her he was very patient and attentive
6927204 if kaelyn were to talk now she should be calling me first ok i was the one who suffered all the pain and all you all just play with her
6927205 i am ready to enjoy myself and truly love what is served
6927206 the small cone with tuna tartar and cr me fraiche was plain and uneventful
6927207 this odd egg muse sic had some really bad sour cream on the top layer it was served inside a partically sic cut egg
6927208 its not my rules its the rules of jesus christ as found in the scriptures im just going by what it says in the scriptures
6927209 i am not i would say this is impossible while living in this body of sin we are in a constant battle with the flesh and our hearts are always set on evil romans 7 i would not presume to say that i am living this out nor can i accept that you are especially when scripture tells us that no one does so we can not say that we are really seeking god especially when god say that no one does
6927210 but from there the land of israel you will seek the lord your god and you will find him if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul
6927211 let the hearts of those who seek the lord rejoice seek the lord and his strength seek his presence continually
6927212 and those who had set their hearts to seek the lord god of israel
6927213 the hand of our god is for good upon all that seek him
6927214 for thou o lord hast not forsaken those who seek thee
6927215 but those who seek the lord understand it justice completely
6927216 seek the lord all you humble of the land who do his commands
6927217 seek and you shall find for he who seeks finds
6927218 for whoever would draw near to god must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him
6927219 and that whoever would not seek the lord the god of israel should be put to death
6927220 my beliefs are directly taken from scripture from my own study and from the holy spirit
6927221 oh look a book washed up on shore it must be the inspired word of god
6927222 for just as the body without the spirit is dead faith without works is not really faith
6927223 thou art not to ask for intercessory prayers from the members of christs body who live in heaven
6927224 mary was a sinner who needed a savior she says it and the whole of scripture affirms that all have sinned
6927225 this is the one i esteem he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word
6927226 you shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below 5 you shall not bow down to them or worship them for i the
6927227 but you talk to the dead and that is forbidden by scripture
6927228 you pray to mary and the saints and that is something reserved for god alone
6927229 lets not start with a predetermined doctrine and seek to prove our points from the bible but instead wipe clean our doctrinal slate and start to build it back up from scripture alone the difference is that we let scripture speak for itself without letting our preferences get in the way
6927230 again what i advocate is getting rid of teachings that have human origins regardless what name is attached to them and returning to what we know to be true the bible
6927231 if you hold to my teaching you are really my disciples 32then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
6927232 how can we know when a message has not been spoken by the lord
6927233 you see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone
6927234 for as the body apart from the spirit is dead so faith apart from works is dead
6927235 abraham believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness
6927236 lets see what the church looks like when built from the ground up from scriptures
6927237 we see here that it is taught that mary is born without sin and remained without sin
6927238 how has anyone been saved if absolutely no one is seeking god
6927239 i have kept my heart pure i am clean and without sin
6927240 i am ruined for i am a man of unclean lips and i live among a people of unclean lips and my eyes have seen the king the lord almighty
6927241 take my life i am no better than my ancestors
6927242 your mother and brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you
6927243 how about the roman catholic churchs opinion of people who reject their teaching once labeled a heretic and killed now called separated brothers and a desire that they return to the faith
6927244 does it also check low level disk access intrusions i know other behavior based ids programs do not
6927245 yes and no to do a low level disk access you have to be in kernel mode by restricting access to kernel mode you are protected from this kind of attacks once the particular driver is in kernel mode there is no way to reliable detect or block it
6927246 hidden files process detection it is something which will be done by root kits after they load into kernel although it is possible to detect hidden files process in some cases but it is not possible to control a kernel mode driver as it already had the highest possible access to system

6927265 among the many options to meet the water supply requirements for southern california is desalination
6927266 the proposed carlsbad desalination project provides 56 000 acres of new water annually replacing water now pumped form the colorado river and northern california
6927267 requirements of the project are to fully offset greenhouse gas emissions and minimize the impact on marine life
6927268 with those two requirements locked in and the need to develop new water supplies for southern california i am comfortable approving the lease of the project
6927269 this is a historic day for the state of california
6927270 as a result of todays state lands commission approval the pacific ocean will soon be a critical component of the states water supply portfolio
6927271 poseidon will be building one of the most technologically advanced and energy efficient seawater desalination plants in the world it will be a model for other desalination projects needed by the state
6927272 its very unlikely that we would bring the i10 to the united states were looking at it but right now its unlikely
6927273 i was yelling and he told me to shut up
6927274 i said i didnt want to file charges i just wanted to get my daughter back

6927279 the finding of such high grade ore as has been recently achieved has not come as any great surprise occasionally while developing the supco winze and driving along the 4th level drift the authors sampling and assaying yielded exceptionally high gold values in several instances exceeding a hundred ounces gold per ton in making the underground assay maps these high assay values were routinely discounted as anomalous but the frequency of their occurrence collectively considered with other important aspects of the vein mineralization and vein structure provided suggestion that the deposit could develop into a significant gold deposit

6927314 hindi ako ang problema e kasi kahit gustuhin ko na tanggapin ng anak ko dahil ang feeling ko challenging yung role kung hindi siya magiging kumportable hindi siya makaka deliver
6927315 first month ko pa lang dito sa lahat ng buong bayan nagpalabas na ako ng sulat saying na i am not encouraging any form of gambling including jueteng and then may mga lumalabas diyan na may share daw ako may kotse
6927316 kasi habang nandidiyan yan yan ang gagawin niya but for me na sasabihin ko na lang laging kokontrahin paano ko makokontra ang 1 3 million na population but ako lang mapapatunayan ko sa inyo im not encouraging it walang sugal pupuwede sa akin pero i cannot do this alone ayaw ninyo bantayan ninyo e diyos ko paano ko mababantayan e kung kayo nga tulungan ninyo ako
6927317 ah gay i think in offer ata but i think hes not for it
6927318 i told him lang na ang importansiya ng isang role hindi sa length it can be short but very very meaningful sabi niya naintindihan naman daw niya hindi pa lang niya ma imagine ang sarili niya ng gay
6927319 sabi ko its not ano naman e screaming gay anak e its not even a closet gay parang behave lang pero sabi niya isa psyche lang daw muna niya ang sarili niya lalo na yan kung matutuloy with john lloyd but i dont know nasa sa kanya if he wants to do it okay pag ayaw niya okay
6927320 kung ite turn down niya yon thats his decision and i will respect him for that
6927321 supposedly isa sa plano ng star cinema oo kung tatanggapin niya kung hindi hihintayin ko na lang yung isa sa usapan ng star cinema na movie with lucky
6927322 kasi kahit gustuhin ko na tanggapin ng anak ko dahil ang feeling ko challenging yung role kung hindi siya magiging kumportable hindi siya makaka deliver so thats why i told star cinema kina inang olive lamasan kina malou santos star cinemas managing director no dont talk to me
6927323 ngayon kung kukunin niya luis fine with me okey sa akin yon pero kung hindi niya kukunin then i will respect his decision ibig sabihin hindi pa siya ready for that role
6927324 kasi mamamatay siya e in the middle of the film mamamatay siya kaya doon kami lalong magkakaengkuwentro ni john lloyd after mamatay nung baklang anak yun ang engkuwentro namin

6927401 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6927402 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6927403 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6927415 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6927416 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6927417 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso

6927420 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6927421 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6927422 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6927423 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6927424 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6927425 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6927429 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6927430 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6927431 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6927432 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6927433 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6927434 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6927435 hemos pedido que faciliten al cien por cien los servicios mientras tengamos que estar aqu y para trasladar a las v ctimas es lo fundamental porque la espera aqu para identificar es muy triste cuanto m s acorten los plazos mejor as que deben poner todos los medios t cnicos para identificar y los materiales para que salgamos lo antes posible de aqu y en las mejores condiciones

6927437 ahora hay que reconocer que han mejorado su atenci n a nosotros porque al principio no hicieron nada nos trajeron de canarias porque moralmente ten an que hacerlo pero ni siquiera nos dieron la informaci n sobre si estaban vivos o no
6927438 los tel fonos de informaci n de spanair no sirvieron para nada
6927439 la vicepresidenta ha garantizado que habr una oficina en la delegaci n de gobierno de canarias para que la gente de la isla tenga acceso a la informaci n
6927440 la solidez y entereza de ahora no son reales as que no sabemos si tendremos fuerzas suficientes para volver aqu

6927442 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6927443 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6927444 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6927447 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6927448 lo que hemos solicitado al ayuntamiento es que por lo menos mientras no se derribe se mantenga un cord n de seguridad alrededor con muros con vallados porque all han muerto al menos tres personas un suicidio y dos accidentes
6927449 las instituciones abogan por el derribo pero quien tiene que asumir los costes que genera son los propietarios
6927450 hasta que no se aclare quien tiene que pagar y no tengan bien atado dif cilmente se podr derribar
6927451 ten a que haberlo dejado hablar para que todas pudi semos escucharlo pero ella estaba tan hecha polvo que no quer a ni o rlo
6927452 de las conversaciones que ellos tuvieron antes de que ella llegara a la gomera y hablara con nosotras no podemos decir nada pero que la llam mientras est bamos all y que el hombre de confianza de l estuvo dando vueltas a nuestro alrededor s que es verdad

6927458 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional

6927460 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6927467 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6927468 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6927469 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6927500 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6927501 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6927502 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6927503 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6927504 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6927505 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6927506 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6927507 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6927508 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6927509 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6927510 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6927511 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6927512 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6927514 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6927515 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6927516 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6927517 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6927518 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6927519 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6927520 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6927521 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6927522 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6927523 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6927524 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6927525 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6927526 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6927527 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6927528 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6927529 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6927530 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6927531 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6927532 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6927533 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6927534 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6927535 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6927536 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6927537 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6927538 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6927539 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6927540 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6927541 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6927542 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6927543 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6927544 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6927545 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6927546 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6927547 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6927548 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6927549 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6927550 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6927551 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6927552 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6927553 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6927554 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6927555 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6927556 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6927557 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6927558 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6927559 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6927560 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6927561 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6927562 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

6927568 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6927569 sabemos que es muy dif cil que haya consuelo aunque lo intentamos lo que s que hay es cercan a los familiares la tienen toda y tambi n toda la ayuda y medios de los que dispone el ministerio de defensa a disposici n de las v ctimas
6927570 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6927571 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6927572 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6927573 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6927574 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6927575 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6927576 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6927577 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6927578 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6927579 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6927580 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6927581 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6927582 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6927583 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6927584 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6927585 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6927586 el piloto apura al m ximo las posibilidades que da la pista
6927587 hay una prolongaci n de seguridad de la pista y parece que el avi n no coge la altura que en situaciones de normalidad estamos acostumbrados a ver explic un avi n a mitad de pista coge altura y aqu necesita m s pista para alcanzar esos metros
6927588 hemos estado muy descontentos con la reacci n de la compa a en los primeros momentos no solo el gobierno de canarias tambi n el presidente del gobierno me ha trasladado que la compa a no estuvo a la altura
6927589 se gripase o que alguna pieza saliese despedida dando al empenaje de cola y eso derivara en un giro del avi n a la derecha que el piloto no pudiera controlar
6927590 lo que dicen las c maras es que no hubo ninguna explosi n durante el despegue
6927591 ser n las cajas amarillas o negras como son conocidas las que lo diluciden
6927592 que se est n dando informaciones amarillas y malintencionadas sobre lo que es llanamente un accidente
6927593 se adoptaron todas las medidas de seguridad que se pudieron tomar
6927594 ya que no se puede olvidar que el piloto siempre es el primer interesado en la seguridad del veh culo que lidera puesto que va en primera fila del mismo
6927595 es el medio m s seguro que existe ya que los aviones sufren un examen cada d a y otro antes de cada vuelo aunque casos como ste sean m s espectaculares
6927596 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6927597 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6927598 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6927599 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6927600 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6927601 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6927602 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6927603 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6927604 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6927605 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6927606 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6927607 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6927608 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6927609 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6927610 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6927611 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6927612 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6927613 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6927614 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6927615 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6927616 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6927617 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6927618 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6927619 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6927620 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6927621 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6927622 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6927623 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6927624 if you are reading this then you are already dead
6927625 a death threat by no means is a legitimate form of political expression
6927626 they told me that if i did not cooperate with them i would not be able to come back to the u s again
6927627 they apparently have carried out that threat for no reason i was denied a visa when i last tried to visit the u s
6927628 the agency is committed to the health and welfare of those in its custody all those detained by ice receive a medical screening by a physician
6927629 we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6927630 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6927631 the little robot can be programmed with a sequence of movements that can be up to 80 steps long
6927632 risks significant misuse of funds in this 39 billion program
6927633 its an offer we feel would satisfy the ends of justice
6927634 and if it can settle the case then we would be happy with it if not then we go to trial
6927635 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras
6927636 we suggest the attorney general resign from running for governor with this weak and frivolous case
6927637 its a limited time offer and theyve got now until sept 3 to say yes to the deal
6927638 were the attorney for the people its a good deal for the people its a good deal for the city we think ultimately its a good deal for all the parties involved
6927639 police yesterday captured a district man who escaped from cheltenham youth center in prince georges county on sunday along with two other detainees maryland state troopers and d c police said they arrested 18 year old demarco e smith in the 700 block of 24th street ne in the district

6927641 tropical storm fay has produced excessive rainfall because it has always been near or over very warm water the state of florida is too skinny east to west to have ever cut the moisture off from fay completely
6927642 the center of fay is expected to continue crossing the northern florida peninsula tonight and then move near or over the florida panhandle on saturday
6927643 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6927644 a loose ligament and im waiting to get more info on what i need to do
6927645 i think he can be close to 100 percent and get back with some real good rehab work
6927646 hes been doing a great job with it and i think he just needs some more time right now
6927647 i am pleased to report another quarter during which we have grown revenues improved margins and strengthened our balance sheet the important steps we have taken over the past year to improve operational efficiency and develop market leading products are beginning to show genuine improvements to our bottom line and this gives me confidence that we are better positioned than ever for future growth
6927648 although we managed to improve margins during the first half of the year we still face a number of potential challenges in the second half in particular wafer costs and wafer quality
6927649 despite these challenges i am confident that our improving supply pipeline declining wafer costs and higher conversion efficiencies will strengthen our gross margin from the end of this year and into 2009
6927650 we are now in a far more stable financial position and are better placed to secure long term supply agreements to expand production and to fund r amp d enhancement in a cost effective manner our contract with rec will help us to reduce overall wafer costs from 2009 we remain cautious about the overall market outlook for wafer prices in the second half of this year however the expected increase in high efficiency cell production will enable us to at least partially offset any increase in wafer cost
6927651 i think this was a bit of a deeper hit in favor of obama because they were able to open up a new front and really try to make headway on this idea that mccains not an average working class american
6927652 the obama team is willing to take that hit in order to drive this other message home
6927653 tomar todas las medidas necesarias para desmontar los infundios que se est n lanzando a trav s de los medios de comunicaci n
6927654 hacen mucho da o a mi mujer y mi hijo
6927655 mi postura ante un tema tan delicado como el que nos ocupa es muy clara actuar como no puede ser de otra forma con los instrumentos que pone a nuestro alcance el sistema judicial
6927656 en lugar de pervertir un derecho tan importante como la libertad de expresi n para hablar de supuestos delitos y hacer afirmaciones malintencionadas
6927657 and there were a couple where there was just smoke in the house and that may or may not be a problem
6927658 one of them was the footing tile and stuff like that our plumbing inspector will make them aware of and make sure they get the corrections made
6927659 that could be a source of some of the problems
6927660 we may be digging up the sewers to get them fixed
6927661 if you have three of those illegally connected sump pumps youre pumping more than the capacity an eight inch sewer can handle
6927662 were looking at multiple things and as you add them all up it does make an impact on the sewer
6927663 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6927664 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6927665 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6927666 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6927667 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6927668 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6927669 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6927670 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6927671 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6927672 we believe hanafi did this because he wanted her to give him all of her assets and a divorce outside of the courts so he would not have to pay her alimony or split their assets
6927673 youre one of only two people in the entire dorm who doesnt drink
6927674 it was one of the ways to deal with the tensions and anxiety of the typical college life instead of drinking until i threw up
6927675 if god isnt a penn state fan why is the sky blue and white
6927676 we ask them if they have a brother or sister if they play a sport if they have pets and from that one thing leads to another and conversation just gets started
6927677 i ts all a little nerve racking we have done daycare so we are used to going everyday but its still my baby going to school
6927678 because they will have as much anxiety as the parent does if the parents high on anxiety then the child is high anxiety
6927679 its always nice to have an extra set of hands when you have 22 five year olds
6927680 you cant fight mother nature you work with her and do what you can do
6927681 this is shocking to me because ive been here since 1999 and it never flooded
6927682 i think that i am responsible for some conduct that has caused damage to the system to my office
6927683 i hope ive conveyed to the court that i feel badly
6927684 if there is a silver lining it is that ive become a better lawyer
6927685 i think a lot of stuff caught up with him
6927686 there was a renovation report done for assumption showing it needed about 10 million in repairs so the cross would be part of that parish leaders and the diocese are working together right now to decide the best future for the church
6927687 but to me its just not the same not having the cross there
6927688 im looking forward to the cross and church being restored
6927689 were seeking out different avenues trying to turn over every stone were looking at any grants from the government charitable donations and contributions from the community
6927690 there have been some public meetings where people have vented
6927691 we dont need 19 million we only need 9 million
6927692 it was a very close knit friendship with one ideal to help the jews
6927693 he got really angry but i told him if youre angry we wont make a deal
6927694 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations
6927695 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6927696 few people in the history of the nfl have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6927697 if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football in that he is obviously going to be missed he was respected by everyone because as a player he was a tough guy and as the union head he was a tough guy but he was also smart and he could compromise and he could make things happen
6927698 he is a man i have always admired and respected through hard work and perseverance gene accomplished so much in his life he was passionate about the game of football and dedicated much of his adult life to improving the game not just for the benefit of the players but for the benefit of all our fans too
6927699 this is a sad day for all of professional football the nfl and the entire football world will miss him greatly gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6927700 with genes passing the nfl has lost an innovator players have lost their advocate and i have lost a friend a hall of fame player gene was also a hall of fame businessman and negotiator he always had the best interests of the nfl players at heart and that played a large role in building our league to the prominence it enjoys today
6927701 he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as executive director of the nflpa gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6927702 he was a true gentleman and his contributions to our great game first as a high character highly skilled player and later as the head of the players union will never be forgotten
6927703 gene was one of the most important figures in sports history he brought freedom to the players he was a rock for the national football league he was a man of great courage and strength he was a great human being there are so many superlatives regarding gene upshaw its hard to do him justice
6927704 gene was an incredible leader for anybody that knows anything about nfl locker rooms obviously there are a lot of egos in there each team elects a player representative so theres a little bit of ego built into that position as well what gene was able to do was bring together all those voices in one room and lead them and convince them that their own personal agendas werent necessarily what was best for the union and that the union always needed to consider past present and future it was an honor to work with him
6927705 it didnt surprise me when he accomplished what he has accomplished because of his ability to communicate with people as head of the nfl player association he had the ability to dial up the commissioner or to dial up individual owners and they would not refuse the call
6927706 when you have a situation particularly in the modern era of union versus management theres some elements of that that are always going to be adversarial but the one thing that you want in all those that make them productive are trust and respect i think that everyone on the management side had that for gene upshaw
6927707 i have great respect for gene i think he brought the players association to a point where its recognized as probably as good a union as there is in all of sport in all of life probably
6927708 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6927709 mommy let go i want to try it by myself
6927710 its sad because you think oh he is a big boy and hes at the big boy school
6927711 im really excited about him getting acquainted with some some new little buddies
6927712 theyre growing up and theyre now going to become little people and doing their own thing
6927713 its all about getting procedures down so they know and they feel safe and then they can feel secure and then they can get down to learning
6927714 its manners its being polite its socialization its just getting along and how you relate to other people along with now that there is so much more in the last 20 years in the curriculum of having them leave as readers
6927715 i cant wait i have cookies you know and ice cream and then well sit down and i want to see everything in his backpack im pretty excited
6927716 im not sure how cohesive the industry has been in relation to politics
6927717 obviously theyre gonna put their money where they think it will have the most benefit
6927718 there is that wing of the republican party who are not friends of gaming
6927719 theres that idea of greasing the wheels of government and theyll figure that democrats will continue to control congress so lets make sure we get in on the ground floor
6927720 im not sure hes had that much influence outside of his own casinos
6927721 hes not always had a smooth relationship with other casino bosses theres bad blood between mr adelson and wynn resorts chairman and ceo steve wynn theyve have had a feud for a while now
6927722 this essentially means that not only do we have the sharpest digital image taken during your mammogram but this technology is carried through if a biopsy is recommended
6927723 it was a long one it was brutal it was just brutal it probably was the hardest decathlon ive ever done in my life through all the extremes and weather conditions
6927724 im very very tired but im also very happy yesterday is a little bad but its generally ok
6927725 i guess i knew that if i finished the race i was going to win but i was still nervous i still get nervous about whether i am going to be able to finish the race
6927726 i was exhausted i had nothing in my legs but my main goal was to come out and compete and win a gold medal
6927727 its a great result for me i prepared well but i didnt actually think about winning a medal before the competition it was only on the first day when i started the competition that i realized i had a chance to win a medal i prepared well for the world championships last year and that followed through to the olympics
6927728 before the competition my goal was to score 8 500 points and i did that so im very happy obviously im very happy with my performance in the running events but i think the event that made the difference was the javelin because i threw a personal best i also had very good results in the hurdles
6927729 i havent been in a competition like this in the past my coach told me that i was only competing against myself and not the other competitors and i never felt a lot of pressure i was very relaxed throughout the competition
6927730 of course i want to go to london because im only young i want to get a better result there but what happens happens
6927731 obviously you know how to swim thats the fastest i ever saw anyone take it
6927732 i had the impression that my head was sinking in water
6927733 i still have psychological injuries up to this day simply thinking of it gives me the chills
6927734 and thus a nation of loud and proud rednecks was born
6927735 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing
6927736 when negotiations are hopefully coming to an end when you can see the end in sight there are a lot of details that have to be worked out and i think were in the process of working out details right now
6927737 the two discussed the agreement we are currently working on with the iraqis and agreed that our teams would continue those discussions

6927757 we do have to do something about the energy problem i can tell you that nothing has really taken me aback more as secretary of state than the way that the politics of energy is warping diplomacy around the world it has given extraordinary power to some states that are using that power in not very good ways for the international system states that would otherwise have very little power

6927759 wealthy saudi financiers and charities have funded terrorist organizations and causes that support terrorism and the ideology that fuels the terrorists agenda even today we believe that saudi donors may still be a significant source of terrorist financing including for the insurgency in iraq

6928151 woman crushed to death when huge stockpile of soap in her basement fell on her in a giant but pleasant smelling avalanche
6928152 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6928153 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6928154 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6928155 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6928156 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6928157 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6928158 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6928159 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6928160 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6928161 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6928162 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6928163 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week

6928179 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6928180 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6928181 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6928182 yeah theres whole bunch of brand names that blew right over me
6928183 do as much research in a week as i possibly can maybe even collecting more data than i had done in the past four months

6928195 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6928196 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6928197 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6928198 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6928199 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6928200 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6928201 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6928202 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6928203 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6928204 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6928205 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6928206 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6928207 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6928208 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6928209 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6928210 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6928211 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6928212 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6928213 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6928214 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6928215 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6928216 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6928217 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6928218 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6928219 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6928220 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6928221 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6928222 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6928223 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6928224 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6928225 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6928226 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6928227 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6928228 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6928229 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6928230 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6928231 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6928232 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6928233 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6928234 this is a planning took where all things are going
6928235 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6928236 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6928237 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6928238 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6928239 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6928240 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6928241 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6928242 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6928243 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6928244 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6928245 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

6928247 classic disruptive innovation where the mainstream dismisses the product and small companies have time to create a real differentiated value
6928248 i didnt ask you if you were fine i asked you if you were happy
6928249 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6928250 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6928251 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6928252 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6928253 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6928254 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6928255 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6928256 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6928257 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6928258 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6928259 wah you pregnant at the right time i am sure you will benefit a lot from the government
6928260 were going to release multi skus so pc ps3 360 q1 next year
6928261 ive never seen the level of activism i now see
6928262 the number of people who have become more active and visible on the national political front has increased dramatically because people have suddenly sensed that they have to be more active in order to defend themselves as americans defend themselves as arabs and muslims
6928263 in talking to muslims theyre really struggling between two things they dont know whether to view barack obama as a lesser of two evils or a really good candidate that they are excited about
6928264 a lot are apprehensive whether to fully endorse barack obama but theres no doubt they view him as a better candidate than mccain
6928265 if he can do it we can we can reach very high goals for many muslims especially after 9 11 have felt discriminated against he has given us a lot of hope and inspiration
6928266 people may have thought this will be perfect and very different
6928267 it is different but its not perfect because politics isnt perfect
6928268 change is the issue and change is a word i think that refers to the economy civil liberties and foreign policy and the general mess people think were in
6928269 if the candidates cannot engage the american muslim community in a healthy way which is the worlds most educated muslim community then how can they strengthen economic ties or have a meaningful successful diplomacy in the muslim world
6928270 this is a way of raising our voice in a democratic society
6928271 since were a democratic party group we are sold on the idea of being democrat but we would raise concerns of the muslim community in the democratic party
6928272 part of being a leader is taking stances that are difficult standing up for whats right
6928273 whats right is a vast majority of muslims love this country and feel very blessed to be in this country
6928274 if something is too good to be true it probably is

6928283 a lot of labels theories and bits of conventional wisdom have been tossed around by pundits and experts lately as they try to figure out how citizens will vote in november
6928284 we are conservative and liberal we are boomers gen yers the hip hop generation we are blue collar voters working class voters and black voters there are energized democrats disaffected republicans and unaffiliated voters
6928285 there is one demographic category however that regularly gets overlooked it is a group that most people simply laugh off are puzzled by or outright dismiss meet the of 2008 the moniker may seem like an oxymoron at first but the worldview that it encompasses fits the politics of many in the post civil rights generation
6928286 the pillars of hip hop republicanism are economic empowerment educational choice access to information and empowering the potential of the individual
6928287 it has cultivated the biggest social network for lesbians ourchart out of a plot line from the show

6928335 here we have an archbishop who speaks openly about the salvation of souls including his own in the conduct of his office as bishop it is very refreshing he understands the disconnect between supporting a catholic childrens hospital and promoting abortion and human embryo destruction he will also be ridiculed by those who dont see the glaring irony thank god for this bishop who is not cowed by human respect or criticism in defense of the souls and lives of his flock
6928336 the catholic church has always taught that the status of your salvation is unknown even to you

6928341 25 of the 33 76 k of c state reps and senators voted against putting traditional marriage on the ballot allowing same sex marriage to continue 15 of the 23 65 k of c state reps voting voted for the buffer zone increase which means that more unborn children will be slaughtered because the free speech right to counsel distressed women on positive alternatives to abortion has been almost silenced
6928342 the k of c founded by fr michael mcgivney as a catholic order is in grave moral decay supreme knight carl anderson must expel the pro abortion and pro homosexual members immediately or he must resign in disgrace

6928354 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6928355 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6928356 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009

6928369 an affront to the identity and mission of the medical center dedicated as it is to the service of life and christs healing mission
6928370 when for economic gain a catholic institution associates itself with such a high profile proponent of the destruction of innocent lives members of the church and other people of good will have the right to be confirmed in their commitment to the gospel of life

6928396 the big concern i have right now is our ability to provide updates
6928397 im not going to get into an argument with people sitting in armchairs telling me what to do
6928398 but this is my third olympics weve got one in the final and two bronze medals thats the best result since 1956 we havent done bad have we i just find the timing of it all unbelievable
6928399 if there are grievances they should be dealt with but at the right time i came here to do a job and they obviously came here to do some sort of other job i dont know what their agenda is this has been coming for a long time and my skin is getting thicker
6928400 the crap in the paper couldnt have come out at a worse time with the three of us in the semi finals
6928401 it never affected me but whoever put it in should get sacked
6928402 i dont think the majority would i certainly would not weve all got respect for him and hes like a second dad to me hes fantastic and all the shit he gets is not fair
6928403 i was dreaming of an olympic final four weeks ago now its happening in the past maybe i havent got the tactics or weight right or silly things like that but now everything is lovely
6928404 if youre into boxing not fighting hes a dream to watch
6928405 i dont know what went wrong but i feel all the good work in me has gone down the pan with that performance he was one sharp bastard the best boxer won on the night
6928406 i have no doubts about that as long as we can retain some our boxers from beijing and retain the funding to go forward and support throughout the sport that would be nice

6928412 id like to pass along to you what i believe is the most complete accounting of how my friend john mccain helped our nation avoid a disaster in iraq
6928413 when you read this article youll understand better what john mccain was up against people told him he was wrong people told him it would cost him his chance for the nomination for president of the united states true to form john mccain decided to listen to the commanders on the ground hed seen the situation with his own eyes and his years of experience in military and foreign affairs convinced him that he could not ignore what was happening in iraq what the commanders were saying and the solution that was required

6928424 there are a lot little things that you dont realize that the seniors and captains have to do
6928425 little things like taking care of the freshmen and make sure everyone knows what they are doing its a fulfilling thing because you feel like you have more responsibility and there are things that you didnt even think about
6928426 we all have very different personalities but were able to lead in different ways and that works really well together were all having a really good time together
6928427 vision is really important in blocking and from day one jordan has had it
6928428 you have to practice it a lot and it takes a lot of work
6928429 everyone made a commitment then and there to change things so that they would never have to experience that again
6928430 i think that everyone has made that commitment from the running test the first day of preseason throughout the whole year the energy that theyve devoted to doing well this year is so real that you can almost touch it
6928431 were not scrimmaging someone that were going to simply run over were going to scrimmage two top teams and its going to be very valuable for us
6928432 i think the team has a lot of confidence in our backfield because we have a couple of players who have been there for a few years and they communicate very well
6928433 i think its pretty inspiring for all of us to see someone that came out of our program doing so well and seeing that kevin really does have long term goals for us really trusting his coaching ability that hes not just here for us to run one fast season
6928434 hes here to really develop us into the best runners that we can be
6928435 our goals are pretty high since were coming off a season with great positive momentum
6928436 as a coach i feel very fortunate to have an experienced group of leaders who i trust and i think that they are going to do a fine job of leading this team to great results and also have a really fun season were going to aim big but weve got to train smart and have fun every step of the way
6928437 im always excited to run with our team but even more so just being up at camp not only when we went out on runs just hanging out in the facilities
6928438 it was just fun we enjoy each others company were excited to all work together to work towards our common goal and keep progressing and doing what we can to get there im just very excited for the season
6928439 anyone that knows me closely would know this is my dream job coming back to my alma mater
6928440 being a player under coach rennie and being an assistant under coach rennie and now stepping into his shoes is a big job and i appreciate all the opportunity im glad to be back and working with these guys
6928441 weve always been ranked in preseason top 10 at least but there has been so much change for this year and i think we are actually welcoming it and its kind of a good place to be with a chip on our shoulder
6928442 everybody came in excited and just real anxious to get started and get out on the field and it has definitely shown throughout with our team camaraderie it definitely showed in our game this past week on wednesday against unc greensboro just the tactics that coach has implemented in us throughout preseason are starting to show a little bit we are definitely getting better and starting to grow as a team and hopefully that will continue to develop as we move through our season
6928443 with the combination of strong upperclassmen leadership and real strong freshmen and sophomore classes we think that we can rejoin what has become the top three in recent years in the acc florida state n c state and virginia which have emerged as the elite teams in acc cross country
6928444 we feel that we are ready to join that group and make it an elite four i think that all four teams can qualify for the ncaa championships
6928445 were hoping that kevin bo waggoner sophomore and i are going to be up there and really start off the season well
6928446 its really important for us to come out and prove that the seniors can be the dominant guys on the team
6928447 i think last year our record didnt give us as much credit as it should have because we did have a good season we just couldnt put teams away
6928448 i think going into the tournament people may have underestimated us a little bit and we showed them what we were made of we had a shaky season but we made our run in the tournament we have to feed off that and thats where our heads are
6928449 we played good soccer all year and had 7 overtime games and the thing i was most proud of was that they had an opportunity to have felt sorry for themselves but never did that
6928450 i think we learned a lot through that we stayed in there trained hard during practice and came out and fought and somewhere along the line those things are going to turn and thats what happened
6928451 going into this season were not overlooking the conference because its going to be really challenging
6928452 were preparing for that and taking one game at a time our conference really prepares us for the post season
6928453 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6928454 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger

6928460 yes youre right it is a nice day to eat outside so lets do that
6928461 the premise for the character when i wrote it originally for the stage was to get behind the facade of the salesman i had joined several gyms and there is always that guy in the front hes intense and hes kind of full of it but deep down hes just a dude trying to make it through the day just like the rest of us i wanted to explore who that guy was and derek came out of that exploration of character hes a former fat kid who decided to do something about it so the same intensity he used to put into eating he now puts into working out hes really tragic because thus far food is the love of his life and while now hot hes very unhappy and oh yeah its a comedy
6928462 how many eps are there and what can we expect in upcoming episodes

6928466 this is my first online project and its very exciting to be getting in on this new medium now my favorite part was the ability to write something and see it shot as i wrote it often times we get notes or have to change things for the censors and it was fun to just be able to write something and put it out there it felt like when we were kids and would make up a play to preform in the living room for family members it had that type of play feel to it but instead of my aunts and uncles its the online community who is our audience

6928484 might be best if i started from the true beginning of the tale who i am and where i am
6928485 i do not like the town house so close to the next nearest house that i can see into the henry wrights bed chamber from my own and so loud with the passing of people and horses on the street nearly as much as i loved the country house wide and quiet smelling of honeysuckle in the spring and ripe golden wheat at the harvest smelling of mother
6928486 father has said that next spring he will get me a tutor so that i may learn the ways of society and be a proper little woman instead of always running out with young henry wright who is a year younger than me but already has a tutor because he is a boy and getting all covered in filth in the gardens
6928487 maybe how i wish for father to pay some mind to me is why i felt so pleased when jonah came around
6928488 when next i saw him two days later he was doing some little bit of harm in that he was taking a still warm loaf of bread from our kitchen heather had set it out near to open window to cool but heather had made six good loaves and he was pilfering the smallest if them
6928489 that evening at dinner i hid my helping of potatoes and half of my overly large serving of roast beef in the pocket of my apron
6928490 once heather was gone back below boards to her glass of beer and her own bed i hopped back out from under the covers and dressed myself to go outside
6928491 a moments searching of the ground beside the window my candle held low to the ground allowed me to find a large set of footprints left in the crisp coating of snow
6928492 he looked up startled when i had gotten very close he was ready to run from me if he had to
6928493 thank you he whispered hoarsely once he had seen what was inside and he sat down to eat it at once
6928494 less than an hour later i was sneaking the extra quilt from the chest in my bed chamber down to the cellar along with some apples from the pantry and a pitcher of water i drew from the well outside so jonah my new friend would not be cold and hungry any longer
6928495 over the next days i found ways to care for the man i would secreted in the cellar bringing him foodstuffs and some of my fathers old clothing to keep the chill off
6928496 you have to stay on the right part of the white line
6928497 it was my mistake and if you stay on the right i dont think it is a problem and it is not dangerous or anything like that
6928498 it is maybe from the outside more difficult to look who is going into the pits than on the inside
6928499 but when a car in front of you goes into the pits you see clearly that he brakes a little bit later and when you go to the pits you brake late

6928507 i just thought he was obviously a good football coach but also a very good communicator
6928508 i thought he had a good way about him he was bright eyed he had a great sense of humor a good laugh he wasnt stiff he was a guy that you knew related well to his players
6928509 its an exciting trip for me i have some good friends there
6928510 although i wasnt there a great deal of time it felt good to be a part of what we were building there i thought it was going to be potentially special i root for those guys because theyre close and personal friends of mine it will be professionalism of course on saturday night but it will be great to see them all players coaches front office people
6928511 he was my first defensive coordinator in the pros while he was here he taught me a whole lot and im still playing by some of his rules now
6928512 its going to be a joy to go out there and play in front of him and just to show off a little bit how far ive come
6928513 mike did a great job here and had a tremendous relationship with the players
6928514 just seeing him work with our defense and the way they came around in such a short period of time i was very impressed with what he did
6928515 he knew how to communicate with everybody and that was very big on my part
6928516 he always talked about being the best at what he does definitely going up to being a head coach and taking that next step and being the best is what hes trying to do
6928517 im sure well have a lot of conversations that will be going back and forth he knows us better than maybe we know ourselves because he sat there and watched every day in practice and meetings and watched our every move he knows our strengths he knows our weaknesses but when it comes to playing a game a lot of it doesnt matter it all comes down to who executes

6928626 would give the commodity futures trading commission cftc additional staff and authority to investigate and prevent excessive speculation in energy markets the bill also would beef up the commissions authority to supervise offshore exchanges which traders use to avoid u s regulation and it would require dealers and traders to file more detailed reports on their oil and gas transactions so that federal regulators can track unusual trading volumes
6928627 the experts tell us that a good amount of the money we now pay at the pump is going into the bank accounts of financial speculators when i was a prosecutor we had a saying follow the money and youll find the bad guy if were going to protect minnesota consumers and businesses we need to follow the money and stop the speculators al franken campaigning to pair up with klobuchar for the next 6 years is an advocate of cracking down on speculators and investigating price gouging he points out that independent experts believe that speculators have contributed as much as 40 to the price of a barrel of oil a post on the franken blog points out that coleman has twice voted to protect a republican created loophole allowing speculators to trade energy futures outside the purview of u s regulators and thus drive up the price of oil meanwhile the only solution he has offered for the high prices minnesotans are paying at the pump giving away more drilling leases in the outer continental shelf wont impact gas prices for at least 22 years
6928628 i know its popular to say you want to do something about gas prices but if norm coleman really means it hell stop playing partisan games and stop protecting his corporate cronies this bill isnt a magic wand but itll have a direct impact on the price minnesotans pay at the pump

6928665 the economy now looks set to grow by just 1 2 percent or so this year with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half
6928666 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets

6928710 in general asian americans are not likely to talk about their psychological problems
6928711 community practitioners notice that asian americans are less likely to self disclose their personal problems
6928712 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
6928713 we can only speculate that it may be that a lot of these women are dedicated to family and they live long lives
6928714 without that kind of extended family older women may be more likely to commit suicide

6928734 allah memberikan pahala kepada orang yang memberi sebutir kurma atau seteguk air atau sehirup susu
6928735 dialah bulan yang permulaannya rahmat pertengahannya ampunan dan akhirnya pembebasan dari neraka barangsiapa meringankan beban dari budak sahaya termasuk di sini para pembantu rumah niscaya allah mengampuni dosanya dan memerdekakannya dari neraka
6928736 oleh karena itu banyakkanlah yang empat perkara di bulan ramadhan dua perkara untuk mendatangkan keridhaan tuhanmu dan dua perkara lagi kamu sangat menghajatinya
6928737 dua perkara yang pertama ialah mengakui dengan sesungguhnya bahwa tidak ada tuhan selain allah dan mohon ampun kepada nya dua perkara yang kamu sangat memerlukannya ialah mohon surga dan perlindungan dari neraka

6928862 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6928863 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6928864 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6928865 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6928866 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6928867 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways

6928896 over six decades modern electronics has evolved through a series of major developments e g transistors integrated circuits memories microprocessors leading to the programmable electronic machines that are ubiquitous today owing both to limitations in hardware and architecture these machines are of limited utility in complex real world environments which demand an intelligence that has not yet been captured in an algorithmic computational paradigm as compared to biological systems for example todays programmable machines are less efficient by a factor of one million to one billion in complex real world environments the synapse program seeks to break the programmable machine paradigm and define a new path forward for creating useful intelligent machines the vision for the anticipated darpa synapse program is the enabling of electronic neuromorphic machine technology that is scalable to biological levels programmable machines are limited not only by their computational capacity but also by an architecture requiring human derived algorithms to both describe and process information from their environment in contrast biological neural systems e g brains autonomously process information in complex environments by automatically learning relevant and probabilistically stable features and associations since real world systems are always many body problems with infinite combinatorial complexity neuromorphic electronic machines would be preferable in a host of applications but useful and practical implementations do not yet exist the key to achieving the vision of the synapse program will be an unprecedented multidisciplinary approach that can coordinate aggressive technology development activities in the following areas 1 hardware 2 architecture 3 simulation and 4 environment
6928897 the 2008 kavli prize in neuroscience was awarded jointly to pasko rakic of the yale university school of medicine us thomas jessell of columbia university us and sten grillner of the karolinska institute in sweden who collectively have deciphered the basic mechanisms that govern the development and functioning of the networks of cells in the brain and spinal cord
6928898 the first kavli prize in neuroscience recognizes a confluence of career achievements that together provide a fundamental understanding of how brain and spinal cord circuits are assembled during development and function in the adult
6928899 for discoveries on the developmental and functional logic of neuronal circuits
6928900 pasko rakic performed groundbreaking studies of the developing cerebral cortex including the discovery of how radial glia guide the neuronal migration that establishes cortical layers and formulated the radial unit hypothesis with its implications for cortical connectivity and evolution
6928901 thomas jessell discovered molecular principles governing the specification and patterning of different neuron types and the development of their synaptic interconnection into sensorimotor circuits
6928902 sten grillner elucidated principles of network organization in the vertebrate locomotor central pattern generator along with its command systems and sensory and higher order control
6928903 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i its for charity

6928906 i decided i need to find my new british bff london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me im in the uk all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges
6928907 he tracked me down in the u k and said he wanted to work with me hed become slightly obsessed with alan partridge for a period which in america is quite odd
6928908 these guys who say i cant wait to retire hot dog and after about a week theyre ready to pull their hair out keep busy and youll stay younger and healthier and youll be around a hell of a lot longer

6928912 i have been accused of doing things to my face but i havent had anything done
6928913 that said stand downs can be the appropriate measure to take when a
6928914 youre faced with a real tough question whats your life
6928915 you face a moment where you think do i come back
6928916 you have to look at it really hard and have the discipline to say i stepped aside for a reason
6928917 your life grooved into that thing you became that job like a quarterback does
6928918 we have had more companies encouraging people to retire early recently but a lot of them simply take the retirement money and go do something else
6928919 we do know that most retired people no matter the reason they retired work at least part time
6928920 there are people with real financial issues and challenges once they retire im not one of them
6928921 if you are lucky enough to tap into a passion and your career happens to match your passion thats great the hard part after retiring is the passion keeps bubbling up
6928922 maybe its a guy thing if the guy has had so much of his identity wrapped up in his profession and hasnt developed other areas of his life to their fuller capacity
6928923 but i would guess that many women now could be experiencing the same kind of thing a transition like this requires a whole reorganization of self and daily life
6928924 the energy required to devote oneself to athletic performance or other pursuits is enormous
6928925 and then when it pays off with recognition that recognition becomes its own high the absence of the adrenaline rush of attention feels more like a depression than a normal state and that can create internal panic
6928926 if youve been at the same job a long time theres a burnout factor your initial reaction is to get away from this totally
6928927 but then you realize i dont want to do nothing you still have youth and all your skills but you dont want to get back in a situation where it has control of you
6928928 i thought i probably could still play but when i retired i was done there were so many things i wanted to do outside baseball
6928929 i had a 2 year old daughter and wanted to watch her grow up

6928933 the petrol prices were fixed after taking into account the real price of petrol from aug 1 to aug 21 as well as the fixing of 30 sen subsidy for both grades
6928934 apart from this the cabinet also decided to reduce the price of diesel by eight sen at rm2 50 per litre the subsidy borne by the government for diesel will be 50 sen for every litre
6928935 it is the governments hope that the reduction in petrol and diesel prices will help alleviate the burden of consumers and reduce the pressure of inflation especially for the lower and middle income groups
6928936 the governments decision was also made based on current economic developments
6928937 if the market price is higher than rm2 70 per litre then the price will remain at rm2 70 per litre

6928941 this was our best quarterly top sales performance in 13 quarters transactions per store increased 2 percent music and fashion accessories were the leaders as we continue to employ strategies necessary to recapture market share in our stores

6928948 shes not the type of person to say hey i dont feel good
6928949 all i hear from her is i hate having this i dont want to take my shot

6928951 she may not make the right decisions and so forth
6928952 i received mine in a blood transfusion back during the vietnam area i went from 200 pounds to 140 and i had forgotten how to get up how to walk and then a friend of mine brought me a border collie

6928954 and i really look for all the rest of em to be clear and these border collies had a lot to do with it
6928955 nothing has worked in type i diabetes many people have tried to modulate the immune response
6928956 theyve all essentially failed because upon the discontinuation of therapy the disease returns
6928957 in the years prior to today i think there was a misconception that the market was very small
6928958 this is a first step in understanding how this drug works
6928959 and if successful our plan is to expand this into other diseases
6928960 most of us do not get autoimmune disease because t regulatory cells keep those cells t effector cells at bay
6928961 we reasoned that in autoimmune disease such as type i diabetes there were likely not enough t regulatory cells to keep the immune system at bay
6928962 if a patient is able to preserve just some of their beta cell capacity whether it be 30 percent or 20 percent or 10 percent then that patient will do better throughout the course of their disease
6928963 will expand a population of regulatory t cells which control the autoimmune process
6928964 the goal is really to stop the progression of this disease
6928965 in the patients were looking for improvement both in metabolic control marked improvements in hbac1 level as well as reduced requirements for insulin
6928966 if we intervene early enough in the course of this disease
6928967 some of these patients may be able to completely stop insulin treatment
6928968 theres nothing in my entire life of which im proud of more than my cherokee blood

6928971 it looks like i got all my feet through that time except one
6928972 one thing led to another and before i knew it they were talking about me in the newspapers
6928973 we put it out in the marketplace and it just stayed in slow motion
6928974 then i misspelled all the words and they called me a humorist
6928975 i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts
6928976 the income tax has created more liars in this country than golf has
6928977 you dont know where i stand politically because i make fun of everybody

6928980 a school with good athletics can only exist when you have good nurturing coaches along with determined talented athletes westlake has both of these
6928981 students expect great things to come from our athletic department
6928982 the discipline it takes to be an athlete is the same discipline it takes to do well academically
6928983 there is a strong correlation between preparing for a game and habits you have to reach academic success
6928984 they prioritize their activities and train as much as they can
6928985 athletics is important to westlake and it shows when we take the court field gym or pool
6928986 its no secret that we practice winning it sounds simple but i dont think all teams practice actually winning they practice forehands backhands serving all of that is good but you have to practice winning too
6928987 they were winners and i wanted to be just like them
6928988 i wanted to play on a team like that i never really dreamed about being a star i just wanted to play on a winning westlake team
6928989 its all about the mentality and tradition of the players coaches and the teams
6928990 its a hard nosed attitude to win we work together to reach the same goal
6928991 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession

6928995 not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment

6929036 we would have loved to provide ample warning to network creators about this decision the difficulty is that im not sure there would have been a way for us to do so that didnt violate the privacy of parties involved
6929037 dr j gross a structural engineer at the national institute of standards and technology nist and a member of the fema asce bps team was involved in these early efforts

6929039 reading sarcasm is not that hard it just requires reading comprehension skills
6929040 i would so suck my own balls for a box of pocky
6929041 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6929042 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6929043 ive been compared to him a lot the last few years because of the way hamels works off of his changeup and his great breaking ball he works in the low 90s and hes able to spot up all three of those pitches
6929044 thats one thing that made me successful in college is that i was able to throw four pitches for strikes i think thats why i get compared to cole
6929045 im happy to be part of the ballclub now and to make it out here to camden yards which is just a great stadium
6929046 i love everything about it so far its been a lot of fun up to this point
6929047 hes not going to be in the next three or four or five days activated no no no
6929048 he is going to be a guy thats going to tell you hes ready but we are going to take the other conservative route on him
6929049 if i dont hurry up and do something with him either one of us is going to go in the straitjacket
6929050 i think that is a lot of food for thought in the offseason with club president andy macphail
6929051 we do know she was at bagram for a long time it was a long time according to my client she was there for years and she was held in american custody her treatment was horrendous
6929052 perhaps its one of the 60s 70s era neighborhoods in spring branch say near memorial dairy ashford
6929053 if you like airplanes you get to see a lot of neat things were always looking to add to our membership in getting kids and younger folks involved so its a really good hobby the people here its good companionship and its just good friends
6929054 i am getting a lot more e mails with students panicking making sure they have the right books orders and are all set to go and registered

6929056 the classes then count as ceus towards their licensing and keeping licensed in addition its helping them earn their degree in caregiving
6929057 childcare isnt just babysitting and our babies and infants from the time they are born their brains are developing and as we do that we can develop different activities with them different appropriate play activities
6929058 it was a little bit intimidating to begin with but it is such as exciting program and when i get talking to people about it in the childcare industry and they start understanding how it can fit into their program its just fun
6929059 its very important to us because when you have people that were as supportive of minot state university as doug was its a chance for all of us to give back in his name and weve got recipients of that scholarship now that i know doug would be very proud of that they are receiving a scholarship in his name for their actions not only in competition but in the classroom
6929060 the man is embarrassed about the indignity brought on the club and the premier league
6929061 he thaksin said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing his ownership
6929062 its almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
6929063 he thaksin has not skipped bail hes not gone back to face the charges
6929064 he wants to be at this ground eastlands on sunday but people may want to come and show their support from his country and he doesnt want to use this as a political platform and there has been a threat to his safety worldwide
6929065 it certainly wasnt up to the standards that we would expect for a school of our size and its nice to get that taken care of
6929066 todays destination is lake metigoshe state park its one of north dakotas hottest weekend attractions and although the summer may be coming to an end activities go year round here at the park
6929067 most of the people that come here are either going to be on the lake doing recreation whether its jet skiing skiing fishing or a great number of them bring their bikes with and theyre hiking and biking on the trail system just enjoying themselves and a lot of those activities are connected right with the learning center that weve got so the combination of that gives a family a great opportunity to come out and spend time together
6929068 there are also miles of scenic trails winding around the park that allow you to see the wide variety of plant an wildlife offered here at metigoshe
6929069 were a complete year round operation we have the typical activities as far as the campground and the boat ramp and picnic areas and those things but once fall starts a lot of great bird watching opportunities go right into winter then it becomes the skiing snow shoeing were right on the state snowmobile trail its a complete year round activity
6929070 its very very inexpensive for a family or an individual to come out and enjoy themselves
6929071 were going to be pumping some water by number five tee box we have a low spot and it will sit for two weeks if we dont pump it out but this is too much volume here were going to have to let mother nature do what it has to do itll have to go away on its own
6929072 the first one when i dumped my raid gauge was 2 20
6929073 we would have loved to provide ample warning to network creators about this decision the difficulty is that im not sure there would have been a way for us to do so that didnt violate the privacy of parties involved
6929074 we are very solid its true and just think that almost all of the defence is out
6929075 last year we also conceded few goals we always had the best defence
6929076 sometimes you think you understand who will like your music but you never do im constantly surprised by who comes up to talk to us after shows when are we not horses came out i was kind of worried people would find the concept of robotic horses who think they are real horses too hokey but instead it just seemed to find a lot of people who sometimes feel like they dont belong or who arent sure what makes them who they are

6929078 some people who spend a lot of time thinking about popular music try awfully hard not to associate themselves with other people who spend a lot of time thinking about popular music
6929079 the convention exemplifies the true rot of our democracy the presidential race gets almost all of the attention and every other level of government gets none because we have come to believe democracy is just a quadrennial vote for president
6929080 a voting system used in 34 states contains a critical programming error that can cause votes to be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards to a central tallying point the manufacturer acknowledges
6929081 russia did not want this crisis the russian leadership is in a strong enough position domestically it did not need a little victorious war russia was dragged into the fray by the recklessness of the georgian president mikheil saakashvili
6929082 more reliable in keeping americans safe during the twenty first century if the party succeeds in doing this it will also lay to rest the enduring myth that strong and wrong is preferable to smart and right
6929083 the key question who finally triggered full conflict remains in dispute the georgians said they staged their offensive only after russian troops began streaming into south ossetia and the russians saying they advanced only after the georgians began attacking south ossetias capital tskhinvali
6929084 even assuming that airlines improve fuel efficiency by about 50 percent in such a scenario the united states could go from having nearly 400 primary airports down to 50 or so

6929089 we have really good 16 player matches but the engine supports up to 64 players and we reduced that because we want to have a sensible minimum spectrum of player and also for the servers the servers are slightly less costly to run than previous battlefield games
6929090 really wed like to have huge 64 player crazy battlefield heroes matches but thats not possible at the moment thats something that wed look at maybe in the future maybe we would have special access to 64 player games potentially

6929106 i dont think its a good idea for you to pick up heavy items
6929107 it would be great if i could continue acting but i think that its very unlikely ill be able to make a proper career of it
6929108 its all so competitive and the chances of making it in this profession are slim
6929109 its a dream of course but im under no illusions
6929110 ive got my back up plan should things not work out
6929111 we had such a great time last year and though i was a lot more nervous doing it the first time around i still have great memories of it
6929112 the show was an enormous success people seemed to love how original it was
6929113 i can remember there were a few gaping mouths but they generally belonged to adults who didnt have children and had forgotten what it was like to be 15 years old
6929114 we were just getting so many people in so were all very pleased about that its a real dream come true
6929115 i was very lucky to get involved in acting really
6929116 ms lawson was running an after school club where people could get together and just try improvisational routines shed worked as a comedian before and just gave us scripts to read and try out ideas with we got the chance to perform the act at school and its just all developed from there
6929117 all the material starts really with the improv games we played with ms lawson
6929118 we got to explore each character we created and try out different settings and situations to build workable scenes its a real group collaboration
6929119 we spend every day with each other really and its still always a lot of fun
6929120 its good to share this weird experience because were still only really children at this adult festival
6929121 there was a worry we might have just been seen as a novelty
6929122 we definitely didnt want to be just some kids doing adult comedy but were all really proud of what weve created people have been coming along to the show with an open mind
6929123 the idea of our work being on tv is just amazing
6929124 it would be so incredible to do more television but youve got to have that ultimate goal
6929125 weve really had to work hard with the flyering but it helped so much
6929126 everyone ive spoken to who has been to see the show really seems to have loved it and the audience reactions have been really encouraging as well lots of laughter
6929127 we have a really great laugh ourselves just doing it
6929128 essentially it is kids doing adult comedy so its a little bit different in that respect from other shows on at the fringe this year but i think the most important thing is for everyone to have a good time
6929129 keep going you can do it youll be so proud once youre finished
6929130 just keep trudging and it will work out i promise

6929142 wage earners and other employees participate in the ownership or the management or in some way share in the profits
6929143 if the social and individual character of work be overlooked it can be neither justly valued nor equitably recompensed
6929144 it is entirely false to ascribe to the property alone or to the work alone whatever has been obtained through the combined effort of both and it is wholly unjust for either denying the efficacy of the other to arrogate to itself whatever has been produced
6929145 every effort must be made that at least in future a just share only of the fruits of production be permitted to accumulate in the hands of the wealthy and that an ample sufficiency be supplied to the workers
6929146 a proper proportion between different wages is also a matter of importance

6929180 i could argue my case but theres really no point
6929181 obviously this is a situation where the similarities are striking
6929182 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6929183 this is his decision and i expect him to make it however he feels is best

6929195 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6929196 from what i hear he was a pretty good player

6929201 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6929202 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6929203 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6929204 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6929205 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6929206 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6929207 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6929208 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6929209 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6929210 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6929211 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6929212 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6929213 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6929214 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6929215 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6929216 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6929217 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6929218 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6929219 even though it wasnt the ending i wanted i wouldnt trade the last four years for anything
6929220 this is the one preseason game that will resemble the regular season nose tackle tank johnson said
6929221 more specific about what we want to do this game than long term
6929222 we need more playing time to come together as a team
6929223 once the games start everybody gets that lather going and youre ready to go out there and play
6929224 i just like to compete man and whatever happens happens
6929225 im learning the defense and im playing without thinking right now so thats the best thing
6929226 a school with good athletics can only exist when you have good nurturing coaches along with determined talented athletes westlake has both of these
6929227 students expect great things to come from our athletic department
6929228 the discipline it takes to be an athlete is the same discipline it takes to do well academically
6929229 there is a strong correlation between preparing for a game and habits you have to reach academic success
6929230 they prioritize their activities and train as much as they can
6929231 athletics is important to westlake and it shows when we take the court field gym or pool
6929232 its no secret that we practice winning it sounds simple but i dont think all teams practice actually winning they practice forehands backhands serving all of that is good but you have to practice winning too
6929233 they were winners and i wanted to be just like them
6929234 i wanted to play on a team like that i never really dreamed about being a star i just wanted to play on a winning westlake team
6929235 its all about the mentality and tradition of the players coaches and the teams
6929236 its a hard nosed attitude to win we work together to reach the same goal
6929237 just go out and hit that first shot in the fairway and go from there
6929238 we were ready for this test and it was a test
6929239 they played a great game even when we werent making our shots they seemed to be making everything we never got rattled our defense really led us through this
6929240 they were determined not to let me score hammon said
6929241 theyve got a great team ill be rooting for them to win gold
6929242 braden is that type of kid that is a good leader
6929243 if you play in this country and you grow up in this country and you put on a russian uniform you are not being patriotic
6929244 i didnt even acknowledge her in the postgame handshake because today she is russian
6929245 this is the only uniform i could ever put on
6929246 she chose to be an american wearing a russian uniform
6929247 during the national anthem i was saying a prayer of thanksgiving that im an american
6929248 i know that in my heart i love my country
6929249 i think garrett has handled this the best he possibly could
6929250 he realizes people know who he is he doesnt try to spruce himself up and let people know who he is
6929251 really i just try to take it as it comes and try not to buy too much into it
6929252 i dont really pay attention to it at all because its all hype and potential and whatnot and it doesnt matter at all
6929253 garrett gilbert can absolutely not dance he cannot dance at all
6929254 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6929255 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6929256 i don know how mahan did it the 48 year old perry said
6929257 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6929258 hope is a great player especially on the crossed ball
6929259 we win this game if she is not on the field
6929260 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves
6929261 changes in the game just since i played have been substantial
6929262 back then high school players never heard of summer football camps the reads quarterbacks and receivers have to make in the wide open passing attacks we have now were also well in the future
6929263 is a lot more sophisticated theres more mental stuff than there was back then
6929264 i was an option quarterback mostly in the wishbone and didnt throw much we did a lot in spring training and maybe a few things in a voluntary summer gym program but if there were specialized summer camps like college coaches run now i never heard about them
6929265 it was held in late june or early july and was helpful and affordable for high school players here in austin but it wasnt specialized
6929266 everybody in it backs linemen whatever all did the same things lifting and running
6929267 players in general seem to be a lot bigger now than they were then
6929268 somebody 6 foot 3 and 230 pounds back then was considered big now almost every high school team has several that height or taller and 250 or heavier
6929269 every major change in the rules has benefited the offense theres more holding allowed
6929270 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6929271 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6929272 i don know how mahan did it the 48 year old perry said
6929273 its kind of the way its been happening for me this olympics
6929274 if youre going to point the finger just point them at me
6929275 this olympics is the jamaican olympics no disrespect to the americans
6929276 they brought their a game i dont know where we left ours its packed somewhere in my suitcase
6929277 i think its interesting that everyone talked about how we win all the time and no one could compete
6929278 it was proven today that teams can the sport should remain its global its international its been a beautiful last two weeks of softball
6929279 honestly i havent even thought about the big picture the loss just hurts too much right now to think about the future
6929280 id take away two pitches the double and the home run those were the only two balls they really hit solid and they just happened to do that at the right time but i felt good
6929281 the first rbi wasnt a hard hit ball it just went to the right spot where we couldnt make a play
6929282 were devastated at the decision at the same time we know that there is still hope we went through our mourning period and anger and frustration with the decision but weve moved forward its over for now but its not for good
6929283 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6929284 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6929285 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6929286 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6929287 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6929288 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6929289 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6929290 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6929291 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6929292 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6929293 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6929294 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6929295 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6929296 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6929297 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6929298 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6929299 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6929300 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6929301 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6929302 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6929303 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6929304 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6929305 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6929306 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6929307 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6929308 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6929309 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6929310 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6929311 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6929312 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6929313 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6929314 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
6929315 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
6929316 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6929317 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6929318 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6929319 my classes were excellent and they prepared me very well for teaching students
6929320 are you from the bay area in the drills i saw sentences about los gatos sic and the city
6929321 i try to remember theyre kids so the messages can be informal and i watch what i write so it doesnt come off curt weve got these symbols such as the happy face that makes it easier
6929322 everybody and their brother is offering distance learning now but some are high quality and some are not
6929323 i thought this would be a nice transition into retirement
6929324 part of the beauty is i can check the messages usually around 8 a m then take a walk and settle in about 10 grading assignments
6929325 i really like it because my focus is only on instruction i dont have to deal with enrollment extensions or any other matters
6929326 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
6929327 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
6929328 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
6929329 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
6929330 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6929331 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
6929332 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
6929333 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
6929334 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
6929335 the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle
6929336 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
6929337 your government annoyed me i am leaving and i pity you because you are not going to have another physics teacher
6929338 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6929339 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6929340 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6929341 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6929342 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6929343 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6929344 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6929345 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6929346 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6929347 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6929348 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6929349 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
6929350 todo el sector agropecuario demanda de recursos evidentemente evaluaremos lo que ser el plan integral para incentivar la producci n agropecuaria en la rep blica dominicana y desarrollar la agro exportaci n la parte tecnol gica entre otros

6929352 est consciente de que tiene un presidente que se preocupa por su seguridad alimentar a
6929353 el presidente ha fijado metas para finales de este a o y en ese tiempo sabremos c mo manejar las cuentas fiscales nosotros hemos planteado el objetivo de evitar la menor inflaci n posible y as lo haremos

6929356 este ajuste de las tasas de inter s busca reducir la emisi n monetaria la cual ha aumentado en nivel y volatilidad desde el pasado mes de julio lo que refleja mayores niveles de liquidez en la econom a
6929357 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6929358 finally it must never be forgotten especially in an age of upheaval and disillusionment that american democracy rests squarely on the assumption of a pious honest self disciplined moral people whatever doubts may exist about the sources of this democracy there can be none about the chief source of the morality that gives it life and substance from puritanism from the way of life that exalted individual responsibility came those homely rules of everyday conduct or if we must those rationalizations of worldly success that have molded the american mind into its unique shape the men of 1776 believed that the good state would rise on the rock of private and public morality that morality was in the case of most men and all states the product of religion and that the earthly mission of religion was to set men free
6929359 nik how can you have some douche with an em
6929360 i agree with chets old position the one he had before he put his manhood in a blind trust and flip flopped to agree with obamas liberal position
6929361 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
6929362 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
6929363 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
6929364 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average
6929365 its not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of man made warming on polar ice melt
6929366 i will make a commitment that al gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem hes somebody i talk to on a regular basis im already consulting with him in terms of these issues but climate change is real
6929367 possible to kill more flies with honey than with vinegar
6929368 you dont get old from living a particular number of years you get old because you have deserted your ideals years wrinkle your skin renouncing your ideals wrinkles your soul worry doubt fear and despair are the enemies which slowly bring us down to the ground and turn us to dust before we die
6929369 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
6929370 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
6929371 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
6929372 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
6929373 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
6929374 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
6929375 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6929376 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6929377 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6929378 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6929379 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6929380 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6929381 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6929382 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6929383 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6929384 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours
6929385 ahhh im not sure i got to concentrate here on my work
6929386 he said all we have to do is find a really rich country like switzerland and marry it
6929387 all of boston is to be placed under house arrest for four days later this month luciannes rhyming readers have responded with their own verses a sample
6929388 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6929389 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6929390 homelessness as a consequence of the private dealings of landlords an arms buildup as a consequence of corporate decisions racial exclusion as a consequence of a private choice
6929391 homelessness crime racism oppression we have the resources and knowledge to fight and overcome these things
6929392 we need to look beyond our isolated situations to define our problems globally we cannot be child advocates in chicago or new york and ignore the web that links us with the children of india or palestine
6929393 in a truly just society there would be a greater sharing of the burden a fairer distribution of material and human resources
6929394 be aware of the social and moral universe we inhabit and be a teacher capable of hope and struggle outrage and action a teacher teaching for social justice and liberation
6929395 the marriages between capitalism and education and capitalism and science have created a foundation for science education that emphasizes corporate values at the expense of social justice and human dignity
6929396 science pedagogy framed around social justice concerns can become a medium to transform individuals schools communities the environment and science itself in ways that promote equity and social justice
6929397 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6929398 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6929399 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6929400 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6929401 it never occurred to me to teach so im not at all surprised that it never occurred to anybody else
6929402 you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
6929403 pwz is a sequel whose script was so horrible that star thomas jane walked away from it
6929404 nick santora and myself whose names were on the second big draft got caught in the crossfire when tom jane was growing dissatisfied with the turn punisher was taking tom lashed out at the script using it as his scapegoat for exiting the project i like tom jane ive had lunch with him think hes a decent guy but i always felt that if marvel really wanted to re invent the franchise youd have to re invent the punisher
6929405 he sounds like a cool guy who loves the character and wants to do him justice
6929406 true fans of the punisher comic books will enjoy this movie
6929407 nobody will see pwz because theres no star power in the cast
6929408 trust me im far from alone in thinking that way
6929409 take your stinking paws off me you damned dirty ape
6929410 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6929411 both the parties have agreed on this the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6929412 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6929413 the suspicious agreement means eternal bondage it violates the iraqi constitution
6929414 el funcionamiento intelectual del se or rub nava debe de ser comparado con la sociedad o poblaci n en la que se manifest su conducta
6929415 el uso de normas extranjeras es una violaci n al derecho a un juicio justo para el se or rub nava al relacionarse con su raza
6929416 retirado en la paz de estes desiertos con pocos pero doctos libros juntos vivo en conversaci n con los difuntos y escucho con mis voces a los muertos
6929417 ten a la impresi n de que mi cabeza estaba sumergida en agua
6929418 hasta el d a de hoy tengo heridas psicol gicas solamente pensar en eso me hace sentir escalofr os
6929419 this is a hint and is disregarded for primitive types it may be used in schema generation
6929420 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6929421 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6929422 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6929423 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6929424 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6929425 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6929426 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6929427 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6929428 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6929429 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6929430 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6929431 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6929432 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6929433 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6929434 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6929435 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6929436 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6929437 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6929438 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6929439 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6929440 the obama camp is telling the mccain campaign people who live in that many houses shouldnt throw stones
6929441 it is looking more and more like senator joe biden is the choice
6929442 biden with blue collar roots could help reinforce obamas latest message
6929443 call it country club economics how many houses does he own
6929444 back to the mccain campaign and this issue theyre fighting which you predicted yesterday would go down as one of those moments in a campaign does this live on and on and on do you think
6929445 nets pounce on mccains housing crisis but not so fast with kerrys 04 gaffe
6929446 i actually did vote for the 87 billion before i voted against it
6929447 when it seemed like president bush didnt know what a supermarket scanner was
6929448 john mccain couldnt answer a question most americans would find simple how many homes do you own
6929449 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6929450 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6929451 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6929452 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6929453 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6929454 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6929455 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6929456 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6929457 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6929458 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6929459 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6929460 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6929461 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6929462 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6929463 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6929464 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6929465 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6929466 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6929467 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6929468 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6929469 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6929470 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6929471 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6929472 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6929473 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6929474 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6929475 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6929476 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6929477 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6929478 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it

6929480 its a huge sh t sandwich and we are all going to have to take a bite
6929481 were able to capture the evidence we need to actually pursue individuals
6929482 but we can change remotely the status of what we want that camera to be doing there are chips in these cameras that will activate the equipment if a particular individual stands in this position for this period of time
6929483 maybe tomorrow its providing security coverage for equipment that may have been stolen
6929484 if something makes that camera start to roll they can dispatch someone
6929485 take a digital picture and it captures the exact location using gps
6929486 my opinion is that the technology exists and we should probably use it
6929487 if it makes the road safer then you should do it
6929488 i see people slowed down rather than speeding up as they approach camera enforced intersections
6929489 but what i will say is that what i see on these videos can scare me
6929490 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6929491 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6929492 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6929493 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6929494 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6929495 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6929496 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6929497 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6929498 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by

6929500 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world

6929502 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6929503 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6929504 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player

6929510 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6929511 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

6929520 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it

6929522 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature

6929525 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6929526 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6929527 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6929528 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

6929532 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6929533 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6929534 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

6929536 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6929537 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6929538 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6929539 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6929540 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6929541 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6929542 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6929543 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6929544 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6929545 the 4 1 2 year military strategy failed because it was a poorly planned amp poorly executed

6929554 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6929555 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6929556 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6929557 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6929558 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6929559 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6929560 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6929561 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6929562 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6929563 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6929564 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6929565 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6929566 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6929567 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6929568 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6929569 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6929570 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6929571 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6929572 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

6929640 currently it appears to me we are getting insufficient response politically
6929641 i therefore suggest in the time now available we urgently concentrate all our efforts in making our representatives at both levels of government to act
6929642 this includes the e petition but does not include people from outside queensland or ineligible entries such as no signature says wendy richardson
6929643 as far as we can tell these are all legitimate signatures
6929644 with only a month left until demolition of the old cairns yacht club building your supporters disenchanted labor voters and many swinging voters in the far north are watching anxiously to see what you are going to do to help us on this issue
6929645 i have been aware but so have many people who have spoken to us that the real issue here is the fact that the labor government is not representing the community they are arrogant and will not listen or be brave enough to stand up to anna and co says richardson
6929646 however you are our opposition and we need you to help us to unashamedly apply as much political pressure as possible in the coming days and weeks on the bligh government including john mickel and andrew fraser the two shareholders of cairns ports
6929647 you can demonstrate your resolve that you will be a party for northerners who feel overwhelmingly neglected by the government your silence or a lack of involvement now will speak volumes in a negative sense
6929648 i urge and request you as strongly as i possibly can to consider what you can do to make these people stop and think what they are doing before it is too late 10 300 people have signed the petition and that was in about 5 weeks these signatures will arrive on your doorstep on monday and we expect thousands more each one of these 10 000 people is aware of the issue and feels attached now to the outcome
6929649 i hope you know you are going to die i just stabbed you in the head
6929650 i did my job now you have to do your job you have to kill him

6929659 w hat they were alleging were violations of existing law we took the allegations very seriously
6929660 shafer told me that the 1999 investigation reviewed logs personnel files and medical records
6929661 because what they were alleging were violations of existing law
6929662 the allegation that infants were allowed to expire in a utility room could not be substantiated and all staff interviewed denied that any infant was ever left alone
6929663 this is not true such measures were not already the law in illinois not according to the department of public health not according to attorney general ryan

6929930 how can they call on the one they have not believed in and how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard and how can they hear without someone preaching to them
6929931 i can genuinely say i did not feel a sense of nervousness that we had to follow that because london brings other things and it will be a different place and a different time
6929932 we will take a london approach and will be different our approach is to keep it simple and creative to make it youthful and diverse entertaining and fun
6929933 we are not going to win over everybody but it is something that will appeal both to younger generations and to more mature generations such as myself
6929934 i dont like him anymore he says bad words there is a lot of bad language there one girl was talking to nathan and she said f you d bag i just felt sick
6929935 i felt sick i hate to hear that then he said b s but the actual words for it
6929936 were a nation of laws and we must enforce our laws were also a nation of immigrants and we must uphold that tradition which has strengthened our country in so many ways these are not contradictory goals america can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time
6929937 an immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive because all elements of this problem must be addressed together or none of them will be solved at all
6929938 this grand belt is going to be one of the greatest projects of the 21st century i would say the greatest
6929939 we cannot wait for the sow petroleum plan to be halfway through or more than halfway before starting the socialist development plan of the orinoco no it is simultaneous
6929940 because this company has the resources and i know they are going to do it
6929941 the president of the republic will designate regional authorities who will have as a function the planning execution follow up and control of the policies plans and approved projects of the ordering and development of the territory in conformity with the centralized planning
6929942 small factories of communal property in which the organized people accelerate the solution to the housing problem
6929943 it is the state and the power of the communities that will achieve it
6929944 anggota jemaat belajar menanggapi hal yang bertentangan antara khotbah muluk jones dan kerasnya aturan dalam kenisah rakyat dan menyalahkan semuanya pada ketidakmampuan diri sendiri dan tidak pada diri jones seorang bekas anggota jemaat yang bernama neva sly mengatakan kami selalu menyalahkan diri kami sendiri jikalau ada yang tidak beres bahasa aneh dan sumbang mulai berkembang di dalam gereja itu di mana sumber alasan adalah apapun yang dikatakan jim jones akhirnya dengan kemahiran berpidato penipuan dan bahasa yang muluk jones bisa meyakinkan bahwa kematian sebenarnya adalah langkah selanjutnya dan dengan ini dia menutupi tindakan putus asa bunuh diri sebagai tindakan bunuh diri revolusioner yang terhormat dan berani para jemaatnya percaya pada kata katanya
6929945 fratelli e sorelle un onore e un piacere trovarmi qui fra voi oggi
6929946 this is a move in the direction of a separatist tendency that is very obvious
6929947 we will not tolerate infringements of the law the police are with the people
6929948 even with all the destruction carried out by the rice growers the supreme court decided in their favor
6929949 the farmers want the indigenous land to be divided into islands they dont want the indigenous land to be a continuous tract of land but legal experts in brazil maintain that there is no legal basis to annul the 2005 demarcation
6929950 in relation to the accusations of money coming in from venezuela and farc rebels i have no evidence for or against it
6929951 but its fair to say that whenever theres some criticism or attack to be made against social movements in brazil the farc are always dragged out although very little evidence is ever provided to prove these allegations so it seems once again that its an attempt to criminalize social movements in brazil and discredit their work in favor of the poor and the marginalized
6929952 indigenous people across the amazon have persistently complained to amnesty and denounced violations committed by soldiers who work indigenous areas sexual abuse physical abuse and intimidation
6929953 there seems to be a clear contradiction in the sense that indigenous areas are meant to limit the access into those areas to guarantee their safety and protection yet when the army goes in there time and time again we see that their rights are violated
6929954 we want to be clear on something fundamental indian lands are brazilian lands
6929955 there are no nations or indian peoples there are brazilians who are indians
6929956 this is something we see not only in the amazon but across brazil
6929957 the cultural social and economic rights of indigneous peoples tend to come into conflict with the economic interests of big agro industry and big agro industry has been the driving force of the recent economic boom thats occuring in brazil and weve seen that theres a lot of political and judicial support for their interests
6929958 when the federal authorities comply with their obligations under the constitution and under international legislation to identify and guarantee indigenous access to their ancestral lands
6929959 the challenges which come up tend to be around the economic interests of big agro industry in this case the rice farmers and time and again the indigenous peoples are losing out because vested interests tend to side with those with economic power
6929960 in this case its not that the military has allied itself with the farmers
6929961 rather two separate interests have come together this handful of farmers theyre extremely wealthy its not about them its about how brazil will use the amazon are they going to just leave it to the indians who wont develop it or does brazil have a plan for developing the amazon this is a discourse of economic development
6929962 they are saying what we do is good for the state and national economy they call themselves the nationalist resistance they consider themselves those who represent the nation against the indians who are supported by foreign interests they never say who these interests are but by conflating the local conflict into this language of nationalism and development of developing the nation they were able to get closer to the militarys cause
6929963 a decision against raposa would create the legal precedents to revoke all indigenous titles to land in brazil
6929964 any other territory could be contested like the yanomami kayap etcetera
6929965 what is on the line here is article 231 of the brazilian constitution and the indigenous rights that are layed out in that article
6929966 its not that the court decision will directly affect the constitution but the arguments that are being used go against article 231 it seems that the justice system is going to favor the big landowners and this will open up the way to revise article 231
6929967 the 1988 constitution allows indigenous people the process to set out and identify their ancestral lands
6929968 theres a real fear that this will set back cases across the country of indigenous peoples who continue to fight for the rights to their land and who through this process continue to seek the provision of their basic human rights and cultural rights
6929969 defined the rights of indigenous peoples over their lands and established that these rights enjoy over riding precedence over any subsequent rights granted to non indigenous holders
6929970 the demarcation process doesnt give indigenous people the full rights to their land but allows the land to be held by the federal government in custody for them
6929971 indigenous peoples are considered minors under brazilian law and thus do not have the right to hold the land for themselves and decide on the land for themselves
6929972 it is an issue which has been hotly contested and which many believe limit the rights of indigenous peoples to their full citizenship and full rights under international law
6929973 it would seriously undermine the whole system of indian reserves in brazil if the courts were to bow to pressure from influential landowners and politicians particularly given the violence the indians have been subjected to
6929974 mark the future of development in brazil in relation to the amazon
6929975 will we continue a predatory model of exploitation that doesnt respect the law
6929976 or will brazil be transformed definitively into a country that develops itself sustainably and respects human rights
6929977 if the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is infinite

6929981 the tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction
6929982 there was no doubt that this poor man was mad but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of lord byron and walter scott
6929983 the concentration resulting from a framework of mythology and theology and philosophy is one of the reasons why dante is a classic and blake only a poet of genius
6929984 if the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is infinite for man has closed himself up till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern
6929985 now to all appearances the point has been reached when the working class living standard cannot be maintained let alone raised even if we squeeze the rich out of existence the mass of the people must either consume less or produce more or am i exaggerating the mess we are in
6929986 he should never turn back from a train of thought because it may lead to heresy and he should not mind very much if his unorthodoxy is smelt out as it probably will be
