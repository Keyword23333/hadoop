2030000 i actually think it is good to show that you can fly major airliners on alternative fuels i think that it is vital that as quickly as possible we move away from business as normal but what we should be looking at i think is how we get that biofuel derived from algae that is the best way to go when it comes to biofuel
2030001 but commercial fuel will almost certainly be derived from algae
2030002 we are delighted to be working with mfusion their commercial experience and knowledge of the gaming and mobile phone industries will be crucial in our next phase of growth

2030005 there is going to be an i 9 11 amp i patriot act
2030006 thanks to vitaly for this great opportunity i have to admit that im not very good at telling stories basically its always been hard to explain every detail on how i get it done and why i did this and that partly the idea for this theme is based upon my own theme which has a slightly personal touch and uses vibrant and appealing colors with some rambling designs and fancy head imagery ive tried to put all pieces together to make the theme literally stand out among other things the start page window of the infinity theme has thumnails and offers delicious integration i tried to keep it as simple as possible unlike regular post entries style with wordpress custom filed functions ive used them to show off image titles next to the thumbnails this design decision is intended to catch readers attention in a better way and it could be a huge advantage for portfolios where designers want to present their photos or design works i hope you enjoy this theme and i would love to hear any comments you have about my new theme and for more information please visit my website or feel free to ask any questions regarding the theme in comments to this post ill do my best to answer them

2030009 striking differences in head size and shape increased bite strength and the development of new structures in the lizards digestive tracts were noted after only 36 years which is an extremely short time scale
2030010 as a result individuals on pod mrcaru have heads that are longer wider and taller than those on pod kopiste which translates into a big increase in bite force
2030011 because plants are tough and fibrous high bite forces allow the lizards to crop smaller pieces from plants which can help them break down the indigestible cell walls
2030012 these structures actually occur in less than 1 percent of all known species of scaled reptiles
2030013 our data shows that evolution of novel structures can occur on extremely short time scales cecal valve evolution probably went hand in hand with a novel association between the lizards on pod mrcaru and microorganisms called nematodes that break down cellulose which were found in their hindguts
2030014 what is unique about this finding is that rapid evolution can affect not only the structure and function of a species but also influence behavioral ecology and natural history

2030025 affirmative action is something the good dont need and the bad dont deserve
2030026 the men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nations greatness but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable especially when that questioning is disinterested for they determine whether we use power or power uses us
2030027 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
2030028 i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually
2030029 hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is but a broken winged bird that cannot fly

2030036 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders the country is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body from winter disease and death
2030037 patriotism is to support your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
2030038 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
2030039 the power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it
2030040 democracy is a system ensuring that the people are governed no better than they deserve

2030043 i wonder how i hmm you are amazing in a good way i dont lays
2030044 who know the next provincial elections will hurt their interests and will not benefit them so they hope to postpone it until doomsday
2030045 we couldn t make a big change in the government structure that pushed us to work to make change in the provincial council but even that we cant touch
2030046 i am sure there are many groups working hard to prevent an election
2030047 i agree with your assessment that the fundamental issues in iraq have yet to be resolved
2030048 every time i have to walk that fine line between advocating that we get out of iraq and not giving in to the people who are rabidly anti military
2030049 a mild tone does not define a logical argument you confuse rhetoric with logic dont pretend otherwise
2030050 gentile it might perhaps be possible to talk about the war against the us being over for now while at the same time seeing the iraqi civil war as simmering on the edge of eruption
2030051 as israel goes so goes america pay attention to the kadima party primary in israel now scheduled for the middle of september it could be the pivotal event in the u s presidential contest with prime minister olmert resigning one step ahead of the sheriff there is a primary for control of his kadima party remember that kadima used to be part of the conservative likud party now headed by benjamin netanyahu but it split off to follow ariel sharon in his path of trying to trade land for peace when sharon fell into a coma olmert took over the contenders are livni the foreign minister and mofaz the former army chief of staff and the current transportation minister as a woman and a moderate livni will get the votes of the left of the kadima party while mofaz captures the right if livni wins not much will change shell pursue olmerts negotiating efforts and will not likely take military action against iran shell fit in nicely with obama in trying to appease iran but if mofaz wins he is very likely to bomb iran he may even cross party lines and form a coalition with netanyahu to get the support in the knesset congress he needs to do so without letting the dovish labor party now part of the ruling coalition slow him down if israel decides to bomb iran to stop it from getting a bomb when would they do it obviously if obama wins the election they had better do it before bush leaves office the democrat might not be sufficiently hard line to offer the necessary u s assistance and the vital american sanction for the operation but can israel really proceed if the president elect doesnt want her to hardly so there is a very good chance that they will decide to bomb iran before the election it doesnt matter what obama thanks of the attack before the election and it might have the ancillary benefit from israels point of view and ours of helping mccain by creating a foreign policy crisis for the u s

2030055 o those who like this deal have any idea how bad eyre has been over his last 10 appearances this is why cubbies were willing to cut him and eat his contract before gillick stumbled along to bail them out here it is 6 1 ip 12 h 1 hr 3bb 7k 9er thats right the guy gives up 2 hits and 1 5 runs an ip

2030060 for more than a year our design team has worked closely with paul to develop a collection of bags that reinvent the standards by which the travel needs of skateboarders are met

2030065 the bid team from chicago will be working alongside the u s olympic committee and national sports governing bodies and international federations to hone their message and introduce themselves and the chicago bid
2030066 its a chance to be here and learn about the games
2030067 its not really selling its more a listening and learning effort
2030068 it will be more informal opportunities literally running into people at events in hotel lobbies it will be done in a very subtle way there may not be discussion of the bid just building relationships and trust
2030069 this slowdown can be explained mainly by a contraction of internal demand with consumption depressed and a fall of exports weighed down by an unduly strong euro
2030070 these factors can only contribute to a serious slowing in the eurozone as the president of the european central bank jean claude trichet recognised on thursday when speaking of very weak growth in coming quarters
2030071 these are the first gdp figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2030072 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavourable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2030073 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent
2030074 barack knows that at some level theres a hole in our soul
2030075 hold onto your stereotypes to justify your ignorance thats america
2030076 he has on two occasions used a web camera and sent pictures once of his penis and once of himself engaged in sexual activity
2030077 as our view of the past expands and our understanding deepens the merit of paul vi in presiding over the council leading it happily to its conclusion and then governing the turbulent post conciliar phase appears ever greater indeed i would say almost superhuman
2030078 theoretically speaking the church could set its mind on reducing its relationships to a minimum endeavoring to isolate itself from dealings with secular society just as it could set itself the task of pointing out the evils that can be found in secular society condemning them and declaring crusades against them
2030079 so also it could approach so close to secular society as to strive to exert a preponderant influence on it or even to exercise a theocratic power over it and so on
2030080 that the relationship of the church to the world without precluding other legitimate forms of expression can be represented better in a dialogue
2030081 dialogue is not proud it is not bitter it is not offensive its authority is intrinsic to the truth it explains to the charity it communicates to the example it proposes it is not a command it is not an imposition it is peaceful it avoids violent methods it is patient it is generous
2030082 not only in the power of ones words but also in an attitude of welcoming the trust of the interlocutor trust promotes confidence and friendship it binds hearts in mutual adherence to the good which excludes all self seeking
2030083 prudence strives to learn the sensitivities of the hearer and requires that we adapt ourselves and the manner of our presentation in a reasonable way lest we be displeasing and incomprehensible
2030084 before speaking it is necessary to listen not only to a mans voice but to his heart
2030085 a man must first be understood and where he merits it agreed with in the very act of trying to make ourselves pastors fathers and teachers of men we must make ourselves their brothers
2030086 wasnt he that boring pope between the two interesting ones
2030087 now dear friends i invite you to foster together with me a devoted and filial memory of the servant of god pope paul vi since three days from now we will recall the 30th anniversary of his death it was in fact the evening of august 6 1978 when he rendered his spirit to god that evening was the feast of the transfiguration of jesus the mystery of divine light that always exercised a singular fascination upon his soul such a supreme pastor of the church paul vi guided the people of god toward the contemplation of the face of christ redeemer of humanity and lord of history it was precisely the loving orientation of the mind and heart towards christ which was one of the cardinal points of the second vatican council a fundamental attitude which my venerated predecessor john paul ii inherited and re launched in the great jubilee of 2000 christ is always at the center of everything at the center of sacred scripture and tradition at the heart of the church of the world and of the entire universe
2030088 we are pleased with the number of signatures that we have obtained and believe it shows that a significant number of ohio residents want a casino in their state

2030097 for nearly 50 years mini owners have enjoyed cars that are at once fuel efficient up to 37 mpg and fun to drive in the face of todays escalating gasoline costs more people than ever are expressing renewed interest in the original premium small car
2030098 what theyll find through the new campaign is that the third party data validates their choice mini cars outrank all other makes and models by the carfun footprint measure

2030107 should a single worker lose a job the ministers will have to go
2030108 they are making us pay for mistakes committed by other fellows
2030109 the country would be paying a whopping 60 percent more for electricity now cosatu led the struggle against this increase and now we will pay 27 percent thats progress
2030110 all of a sudden you have the president and minister of finance going public to say those things will not happen
2030111 these kids have been taking tests for more than 10 years
2030112 i dont know that we will do much of anything
2030113 these resignations are politically motivated these lecturers must be upset with having lost their privileged status at their universities g ls appointments are the best since 1992
2030114 why did they not react when sezer appointed a candidate who received only one vote why did they remain silent their resignations are politically motivated
2030115 our universities need democratic administrators who will busy themselves with scientific research we cannot gain anything from polarization i believe the newly appointed rectors will not discriminate against anyone at their universities g ls appointments are more democratic than those of the past
2030116 the idea of it being completely absent from the most important exams of your childhood is disgraceful
2030117 i used to write for small orchestras when i was 15
2030118 if you dont learn to read music then theres a whole tradition that becomes very exclusive and shouldnt be
2030119 it depends what you believe a secondary school musical education is for
2030120 if its about accessing the western classical tradition then of course you need to learn staff notation
2030121 just because a musical tradition is transmitted through staff notation does not mean that it is superior you only have to spend half an hour with good indian musicians to appreciate that
2030122 where i think damon albarn is right is that if you think you are ever going to need to use staff notation you need to learn it young like every other kind of musical skill
2030123 i am not a musician i dont go in too deep if you have the music in your head and you sing it with your body then youll be all right
2030124 i dont read music i dont write i dont play all i can do is tell you how it goes like dumdum dum dumde dum
2030125 iraqs electricity infrastructure will be rebuilt we can work together on this subject
2030126 turkish petroleum corporation tpao turkish firms and japanese companies may form a consortium to open new oil fields and develop existing ones
2030127 japan is very interested in securing our source of oil because we are dependent 90 percent on this region
2030128 the whole world admits the experience and logistical advantage of turkish companies in iraq already many foreign firms are taking initiatives to form alliances with turkish companies especially in the construction sector
2030129 we talked with iraqi officials on these matters and turkish businessmen talked with iraqi ministers face to face i believe profitable works will be carried out in the days ahead
2030130 but of course these deputies have influence in foreign affairs maybe they can lobby with private firms and make recommendations
2030131 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

2030145 every citizens social security number must be protected its hard to believe that ms dinolfo has refused to shut down her website until these documents are removed it is a risky decision that is making an untold number of monroe county residents vulnerable to financial criminals shes had more than 24 hours to take action and she has failed that is simply unacceptable
2030146 it is imperative that all social security numbers be removed from the county clerks website immediately and that steps be taken to ensure that monroe county residents are not put at risk like this again

2030153 set aside his own reading of the constitution the judges past instructions and judge the facts solely upon the judges explanation of the law
2030154 i consider trial by jury the greatest anchor ever yet devised by humankind for holding a government to the principles of its constitution
2030155 a form of juror misconduct that could be classified as nullification
2030156 many cases never reach trial because the lawyers do not feel comfortable presenting their case to twelve of their fellow citizens
2030157 judges should sometimes nullify statutes that are bad policy or create judge made rules when that would serve the ends of good policymaking
2030158 the judiciary never could have become a vibrant countermajoritarian force and create a nationwide system that makes binding constitutional adjudication as close as the nearest federal courthouse
2030159 nullifiers do not openly disobey the law in order to change it
2030160 they conspire behind closed doors and cast the law aside at their caprice
2030161 there is a price for free trade and its paid for by working men and women who have to go home and explain to their families that they lost their job because it was cheaper to do the work in china its paid for by the people who have had to leave their families behind to seek jobs elsewhere and its paid for by all of us at the gas pumps and in grocery stores but it doesnt have to be this way
2030162 first in washington we must address the broken system that creates bad policy by eliminating the influence of special interest money lobbyists pacs and special interests have too much power in washington and thats wrong
2030163 second we must cancel the free trade agreements that allow predatory trade policies to exploit our agricultural markets and our workers

2030220 surely a lone nut could not have carried out this technically difficult and logistically complicated scheme to terrorize an entire nation on the eve of such momentous events
2030221 the fbi and those in the administration who used the anthrax attacks to stoke up a war just want to convince the american public a group they obviously hold in such low regard that they dont bother with such niceties as logic and real evidence just tell them a story and make it a good one

2030250 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
2030251 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

2030268 we are expecting the unexpected our preparations are constantly changing
2030269 climate change must be a wholly legitimate subject of protest and demonstration but if it is met by an arbitrary destructive and aggressive police response the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent law abiding people particularly the young
2030270 what we are doing is part of a long tradition of civil disobedience
2030271 were not blas about breaking the law but the threat that new coal poses to our future on this planet more than justifies the actions we are taking
2030272 the searches have been absurdly over the top with everything from 26 foot banners to disabled access ramps taken away
2030273 its a concerted attempt to demonise people and alienate members of the public so they dont think it is safe to come here its a depressing a chilling attack on the right to freedom of expression and assembly

2030289 what shall we say after this if god is with us who can be against us who shall separate us from the love of jesus will it be trials or anguish persecution or hunger lack of clothing dangers or sword no thanks to god who has loved us nothing can separate us from that love
2030290 i am certain neither death nor life neither angels nor spiritual powers not any creature whatsoever can ever separate us from the love of god which we know and have in jesus christ our lord

2030296 at the time of these events iain burns was the head of pr at british airways with no responsibility for pricing decisions given his very high level of co operation to the oft iain is naturally disappointed with their decision however he hopes that it will allow this case to be fully analysed before a court and finally provide him with the opportunity to clear his name

2030303 we do not want violent confrontation we are part of the political process and we are fighters against alqaeda and against criminals our concern is the dispossession of the rights of arabs and the confirmation of the iraqness of kirkuk

2030307 if we did nothing except for wait for next pride we couldnt have done it
2030308 it would have been tough but its not like we said there was no money and said you have to resign
2030309 i cant respond to that but i also know that in the 15 years that i have been involved in the organization there have been all sorts of stuff flying around about me i wouldnt be with the organization for 15 years if every time i heard something or read something it affected me in a negative way
2030310 she considered that the financials are going to be tough and she felt this was a great time for her to go back to school and for her to spend more time going after her degree

2030320 we would help take care of him help him out
2030321 ive been able to meet artists potters its a different culture
2030322 it takes a certain kind of collector to collect folk art
2030323 they have to be forward thinking and i find many of them are from the gay or jewish community fifteen years ago this wasnt considered real art but these people gays jews are the ones who started collecting the art giving the artists shows
2030324 i dont know what it is about those two groups but they like to leave the mainstream thinking the artists are so out there and i think people relate to that
2030325 not only were we able to make a small protest against a very unjust and hateful resolution but many of our best customers and friends we have made along this 15 year journey are gay
2030326 we have a strong regular clientele who like to collect the meaders renowned for face jugs and howard finsters and high end folk art
2030327 to me the skys the limit folk art is aesthetically pleasing it speaks to me
2030328 no compromise with the main purpose no peace till victory no pact with unrepentant wrong
2030329 the strong crown makes purchases abroad cheaper and so the situation at customs is now much worse than it was at christmas there are at least 50 percent more parcels than last year

2030331 this is the result of easier internet access greater knowledge of english and good prices in the united states
2030332 those who have no concern for the plight of former criminals regardless of how much these individuals have done to turn their lives around should know that alienating ex offenders does nothing more than pressure a return to criminal behavior
2030333 the key to turning back voting laws is to empower the individuals affected by them
2030334 the primary goal of the corrections system is to rehabilitate those who have committed crimes and return them as contributing members to society
2030335 beshear has done the right thing now the general assembly should follow his lead
2030336 it makes every kind of sense for gov steve beshear to have restored voting rights
2030337 giving convicts a stake in decent society and its democratic processes is not only the just thing to do but the smart investment to make
2030338 he had made efforts to reinstate his voting rights and had got confused it wasnt intentional
2030339 were trying to get the voter rights restored and its been simplified but thats another felony charge and you have to start all over again
2030340 anything that prohibits the vote of the public should be challenged
2030341 anytime the government starts discussing new policies for voting it should raise a red flag for society
2030342 we dont want the most vulnerable to be disenfranchised because they are vulnerable
2030343 we must be vigilant and persistent in helping each other
2030344 first in a democracy everyones voice should count we should be wary of any attempt to restrict the right to vote based on perceived political views loyalty or behavior in fact there is no evidence that people with felony convictions have significantly different views on defense policy taxation abortion or any other issue of concern to most americans voting is also important for reasons of fairness and public safety people living in the community on probation or parole supervision or who have completed their felony sentence are subject to all the obligations and responsibilities of other citizens they work pay taxes and support their children denying them the right to vote only communicates a message of second class citizenship
2030345 to participate in self government you must be willing to accept the rule of law we dont let everyone vote children noncitizens and the mentally incompetent dont voting requires certain minimum objective standards of trustworthiness loyalty and responsibility and those who have committed serious crimes against their fellow citizens dont meet those standards
2030346 included about 90 000 cases that date back to the early 80s and about 25 000 more recent cases pending final action by the board therefore the 115 000 figure appears to be at least somewhat illusory
2030347 with another stroke of his pen gov crist with support from at least two cabinet members could restore the civil rights of many more ex offenders who have completed their sentences enabling them to register to vote only then will the rights restoration process reflect the fundamental fairness that the governor has been talking about
2030348 now im going to do everything in my power to give back to my community and voting can help
2030349 i walked around with my head down thinking i cant vote
2030350 come to find out its a totally different story i can voice my opinion now instead of being pushed back in a corner
2030351 im very pleased that felons that have paid their debt to society have the opportunity to vote and make a difference in the elections
2030352 its imperative for felons to know and follow through in the process to get their voting fully restored
2030353 before you answer dad you should know that ms pruitt apparently is not one of those apathetic non voters you were moaning about a few weeks ago she really does want to vote and had every intention of showing up at her local voting precinct on election day like every other citizen in jefferson county

2030357 no intention of granting production tenures for underground coal gasification for at least three years
2030358 advice from the office of the minister for mines and energy
2030359 the department of mines and energy has no intention of granting production tenures for underground coal gasification for at least three years underground coal gasification is a new technology untried in australian conditions and it poses some potential problems especially with groundwater systems we will only do whats best for queensland in this case we dont believe its in the best interests of queensland to grant production tenures for technology that is untried it would have to meet the most stringent environmental standards
2030360 now coal is a very impure fuel its mostly carbon but there are impurities

2030371 that although the standard for admissibility at sentencing is whether the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy a disputed fact must nonetheless be proved by a preponderance of the evidence
2030372 these activists have delivered a message of solidarity with the tibetan people highlighting the grave situation in tibet just moments before the beijing olympics began
2030373 the chinese government wants the world to be dazzled and distracted by the grandeur of the opening ceremony but its true face can be seen in its ruthless and intensifying repression of the tibetan people

2030386 its not about whether you support the war in iraq or afghanistan its about supporting our soldiers
2030387 what jamie would have wanted is for our guys to be supported when they come home
2030388 its not about whether you support the war theyre fighting they are soldiers who go there to do a hard job and they do it really well
2030389 i revisited some places in america where id been with jamie and went to sea world where he swam with dolphins they showed a video of americas soldiers and everyone got up to salute i would love our own soldiers to be held in that esteem
2030390 the soldiers out there need to know not only that theyve achieved something but that they can come away from it it would boost the morale of the lads and their families to know theres an end to have a date to look forward to we have to leave it in the iraqis or the afghans own hands at some point
2030391 jamie was fearless right to the end after he died his commanding officer told me he had been at the sangha lookout with another soldier when they came under attack the other young man ducked and tried to pull jamie with him but he wouldnt back down
2030392 when he volunteered for iraq i was upset but i realised it was something he really wanted to do he saw it as an opportunity to put his training into practice and he had plans to do a back to back tour going to afghanistan after
2030393 he was gutsy and knew how dangerous it was out there but that was his strength of character as far as jamie was concerned he was a soldier he had a job to do and he wouldnt back down
2030394 when things were tough jamie would make light heart of it people looked up to him for that and i have learnt a lot from his qualities
2030395 whenever i have had low days i have drawn from his strength and if joe is posted there like jamie i will know it is what he wants to do like i would say to the parents of all servicemen and women just concentrate on them coming home
2030396 the abf does a great job at offering support which is not available elsewhere jamie would want people to support them and give them the funding they need to continue that work

2030419 we will encourage him to carry on doing that but there are other elements of his game that maybe are weaknesses that he needs to work on he has a lot of developing to do physically and in football terms but he has the potential without any shadow of doubt
2030420 we will not rush him but we want to expose him to senior football and we will continue to do that and then things will not be a surprise for him neil mcnabs moustache manchester 8 08 2008 at 14 12

2030429 they have some areas which are now misty which is a really interesting effect walking through a mist previously they had sort of grayed out the scene and called it mist but now its hard to peer through
2030430 theyve again taken the end game and made it more accessible to more people
2030431 without costing the high end players without giving up the challenge that keeps the high end players motivated
2030432 i think blizzard has learned a lot from the last expansion release
2030433 even a group of ten people will be able to conquer the very highest end game content while 25 man versions will let people who want to be more hardcore do that as well
2030434 if youre familiar with the mechanics of the 10 person version
2030435 then you should be familiar with the 25 person version at least in the philosophical sense

2030439 the relationship between turks and the african continent dates back to the year 868 when a turkish state the tulunids was established in africa and was sovereign until 905 this means that even before coming to anatolia for the first time after the victory of malazgirt in 1071 turks were there
2030440 during the ottoman empire there were many territories under ottoman rule that are now sovereign states such as egypt libya tunisia algeria eritrea djibouti sudan and somalia as well as the north of todays ethiopia
2030441 such experience led to a great respect for turks a respect that is still alive in the memories of the african people also the leaders of all of those now independent states always say they were inspired by the struggle of the turkish republics founder mustafa kemal atat rk during the decolonization period that eventually led to their independence
2030442 we need a level of representation in africa that befits todays turkey which is a regional power with a clout surpassing the geographical space in which it is located
2030443 quite categorically mr mandela has not accepted the atat rk award and has no plans to visit turkey the ancs attitude does not reflect any negative view of kemal atat rk the reformer and founder of modern turkey

2030475 the clearest picture to date of the u s epidemic
2030476 its like shifting from standard view to widescreen or hd television
2030477 cdcs new incidence estimates reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known
2030478 that the number of new infections was never as low as 40 000
2030479 it is important to note that the new estimates reflect our ability to more precisely measure hiv incidence and does not represent an overall increase in new infections
2030480 these numbers are a scathing indictment of how profoundly u s and cdc hiv prevention efforts have failed
2030481 despite the way the cdc is spinning these new numbers which ahf has been calling for the public release since last october there is absolutely no good news here
2030482 our trend analysis confirmed earlier fears that infections have in fact been rising among men who have sex with men as the data show a steady increase in infections among gay and bisexual men since the early 1990s
2030483 unfortunately these data among gay and bisexual men point to an urgent unmet need within this population
2030484 much more must be done to reverse the concerning increases among gay and bisexual men
2030485 we must recognize this epidemic as the crisis that it is and match our collective response to the severity of the problem
2030486 for years prevention efforts serving gay men have been stifled by ideologues
2030487 it is clear that the nations hiv prevention efforts must be delivered in a manner that respects the real life experiences of gay and bisexual men and african americans all who unacceptably bear the greatest burden of hiv disease
2030488 the fact that the new estimate numbers are showing this 40 percent increase while deeply disturbing is not different from what weve been experiencing in the field
2030489 in response to the lack of urgency the cdc showed
2030490 they have been working with us to put some things in place so that they wouldnt be caught flat footed when these numbers came out
2030491 insure that we are focusing our resources in the right places and with the right people

2030514 ultimately it is oil and the operating losses that will force some of these guys to the wall
2030515 airlines are dealing with high oil prices weakening demand and the need to maximise revenues in different ways
2030516 ba is increasing average fares but letting the number of seats sold per flight slip that does not work with ryanairs network or its product plus ryanair is trying to grow at 14 per year while ba is shrinking different growth profiles means different reactions on fares
2030517 if airlines get a break in the oil price some of them will get financing from some idiot the more expensive oil is the faster we roll up the loss making companies that are not going to survive anyway

2030526 throughout his work luke sought to demonstrate the truthfulness of what he recorded by tying the events to universal history
2030527 but most of these have been rendered futile by light from the monuments of antiquity and the archaeologists spade
2030528 luke is a first class ancient historian he is not careless nor is he a fabricator of events
2030529 his statements of fact are trustworthy he is possessed of the true historic sense
2030530 luke was a historian because he was first and foremost an evangelist he knew that the faith which he wished to proclaim stands or falls with the history of jesus and the early church
2030531 this means that luke is fully trustworthy as a historian of the life of christ
2030532 therefore to read the third gospel is to encounter the authentic historical jesus
2030533 in every case it has been concluded that an even handed treatment of the data does not lead to a distrust of the accuracy of the gospels in what they choose to report
2030534 they should be judged for what they do tell us not for what they do not tell us
2030535 confirmed time and again by external evidence t o the unbiased observer little doubt can be cast on the statement that archaeology has confirmed the historical reliability of the new testament
2030536 the role of archaeology in the study of the new testament
2030537 although the gospels were not written by scientific historians we have found good reason to believe that they incorporate reliable information about jesus so that the ordinary reader may rest confident that the portraits of jesus in the gospels are based on historical fact

2030541 it was well timed since now microsoft has started targeting conferences

2030553 golds macd shows it is more oversold right now than at any time in the last 8 years gold typically shows seasonal weakness in the mid to late summer u s monetary policy with bailouts for banks investment banks housing and soon the auto industry is clearly inflationary inflation has much more to do with monetary policy than it does with the level of economic activity inflation is going up which means gold is going up gold is much more a currency than a commodity gold tends to get dragged down with the rest of the commodity complex as if it were a commodity this creates fantastic buying opportunities as inflation kicks up physical demand kicks in and gold powers higher overpowering the false gold as commodity notion golds technicals seasonal trading patterns and fundamental underlying economic conditions all point to this being the right time to buy gold if you have at least a 6 month time horizon

2030648 after moving into virtually every occupation women are being afflicted on a large scale by the same troubles as men downturns layoffs outsourcing stagnant wages or the discouraging prospect of an outright pay cut
2030649 indeed for the first time since the womens movement came to life an economic recovery has come and gone and the percentage of women at work has fallen not risen the bureau of labor statistics reports each of the seven previous recoveries since 1960 ended with a greater percentage of women at work than when it began

2030651 the substantial increase in the share of the workforce over age 55 in the coming years could lead to a glut of older workers despite the overall labor force slowdown sapozhnikov and triest 2007 too many older workers could result in lower wages and employment rates at older ages
2030652 although older workers are paid more than younger workers and may be less likely to be laid off experimental evidence suggests some employers may still discriminate on age in hiring decisions and survey evidence from the 1990s finds they are less likely to train older than younger workers

2030684 they are without a doubt very useful in developing countries where it is very difficult for a woman trade union leader to gain acceptance although the delegations attending international trade union congresses are more mixed than in the past its still rare to see a woman getting up and speaking because there are still too few of them in the posts of general secretary and chairperson im convinced that it would be even more difficult without quotas for women and young people which is why this system has to be maintained and even strengthened for some years to come the ituc constitution demands at least 30 female participation in trade union delegations and meetings but women represent 40 of the itucs membership so why not demand 40 female representation in delegations and meetings

2030762 greyhounds sound like the libertines as told to okkervill river if that
2030763 for followers to believe in him jesus meant and means not only that we have faith in jesus but also that we share the faith of jesus that our world is on a suicidal trajectory and that our lives can make a difference whilst most of us wont be called to sacrifice our physical lives but many may having faith in jesus and sharing the faith of jesus will lead all of us to make what an early disciple called a living sacrifice we will give up the life we could have lived the life we would have lived pursuing pleasure leisure treasure security whatever and instead we live a life dedicated to replacing the suicide machine with a sacred ecosystem a beautiful community an insurgency of healing and peace a creative global family an unterror movement of faith hope and love
2030764 when people have no hope all they think about is scraping by for one more day there is no tomorrow there is no creativity there is no will to organise people cant even think straight because they have no hope
2030765 no we were there because we genuinely loved them no not just that we liked them it wasnt the resource we bought that made a difference it was our presence we were simply among them as people with hope among them as people with love and that made the difference they caught our hope

2030773 while the evidence tells me that the death penalty does little to deter crime i believe there are some crimes mass murder the rape and murder of a child so heinous so beyond the pale that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment
2030774 i also think the democratic party can be smug detached and dogmatic at times i believe in the free market competition and entrepreneurship and think no small number of government programs dont work as advertised i think america has more often been a force for good than for ill in the world i carry few illusions about our enemies and revere the courage and competence of our military i reject a politics that is based solely on racial identity gender identity sexual orientation or victimhood generally i think much of what ails the inner city involves a breakdown in culture that will not be cured by money alone

2030807 there will be four or five people singing with music about god
2030808 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
2030809 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
2030810 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
2030811 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
2030812 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
2030813 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
2030814 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
2030815 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
2030816 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
2030817 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
2030818 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
2030819 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
2030820 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery

2030839 termination was not an option for me and i informed the doctor of this immediately
2030840 he is our creation and gods creation and we will take him as he comes
2030841 with each new day i learn to accept this situation
2030842 for example i know that i cannot change my circumstances and therefore must proceed with the daily grind of life in other ways it becomes more difficult it is a very odd experience to be pregnant knowing that i may never get to bring my baby home from the hospital and that instead of anticipating his whole life i may have to prepare for his funeral and burial
2030843 i say he must really be extraordinary to be discounting all medical theories with respect to chromosome gene results and his longevity
2030844 i tell him that even the doctors arent sure why hes lived so long most babies with these abnormalities self abort long before now and that he is special because of this i tell you this because i want you to know that despite the grim outlook i am carrying this baby as long as he will let me and will not be the killing hand
2030845 the little one in my womb is moving around kicking his mother and hopefully enjoying a refreshing swim i am told that he knows no pain and that while he is in the uterus he is as safe as can be i walk him every day talk to him often and pray for him always

2030852 at the moment the wing of the party that tends toward ideology has the majority the position i have long represented is not the strongest in the party now
2030853 clements offence is to be a prime mover behind the agenda 2010 reforms and one of the loudest voices against efforts to water them down schr der is out of the picture and m ntefering is likewise quiet

2030869 come november well take a good look at it and well see how things are going
2030870 at the moment i think its important that he just gets a chance to concentrate on his own game because hes been shouldering things for the last five years
2030871 it wouldnt be usual anyway to name a captain at the start of a coaching set up well just see how things go and give him a chance to enjoy his own rugby

2030875 there have been numerous attempts to distract the game from the fundamental issue which is that a contract is a binding commitment on the part of both the player and the club
2030876 it protects both parties and places responsibilities on both parties
2030877 the issuing of a nsw supreme court order in respect of those responsibilities should provide a stark reminder to sonny bill of the importance of him observing the terms of his contract
2030878 it is a very serious matter for such an order to be granted and anyone who breaks an order of the nsw supreme court would face contempt proceedings from that court

2030890 r kelly was very instrumental in making a lot of decisions when it came to my records being played on the radio
2030891 he would make a call to the radio station or to the label and say hey this joe record is too hot right now yall sic need to pull that back and they would oblige its incredible that now i get the opportunity to i dont know maybe pay r kelly back in some sort of side bar kind of thing
2030892 im still very relevant in the game but yeah he did try to make some decisions when it came down to my records being on fire and climbing up the charts and on the radio stations he felt like they should pull back because he felt he was more important and with their loyalty to him they obliged
2030893 nelly is the only man i would let tie me up and have his way i am willing to totally submit to him damn that ashanti is a fortunate girl because i am not a home wrecker but i know people that know people that know him she better stay on her toes with this one lol
2030894 the pick turns into a third round selection if favre plays in 50 percent of the plays this season a second rounder if he plays in 70 percent of the plays and the jets qualify for the playoffs and a first round pick if he plays in 80 percent of the plays and jets make it to the super bowl
2030895 not only did the packers block the vikings from trading for favre but they also have done the same to every team in the nfc north if the jets were to trade favre to any nfc north team they would have to give green bay three no 1 picks and green bay didnt even stop there the trade also includes provisions preventing a trade to another team if they were to trade him to the nfc north
2030896 look i realize i work on commission and this might sounds like im only trying to make a sale but based on what youve explained to me and what it is i think youre wanting to get out of your camera i dont think an extender is the way to go youll lose a lot of the light you need for action shots and at 600 mm telephoto youll probably need to use a tripod which doesnt seem conducive to action photography to be honest i think you would be better off with a new camera body but i promise im not just trying to make a sale

2030933 the sacred books which contain the prayers recited or chanted during the mithraic survives the ritual on the initiates and the ceremonials of the feasts have vanished and left scarce a trace behind we know the esoteric disciplines of the mysteries only from a few indiscretions
2030934 there were however a number of serious problems with cumonts assumption that the mithraic mysteries derived from ancient iranian religion most significant among these is that there is no parallel in ancient iran to the iconography which is the primary fact of the roman mithraic cult for example as already mentioned by far the most important icon in the roman cult was the tauroctony this scene shows mithras in the act of killing a bull accompanied by a dog a snake a raven and a scorpion the scene is depicted as taking place inside a cave like the mithraeum itself this icon was located in the most important place in every mithraeum and therefore must have been an expression of the central myth of the roman cult thus if the god mithras of the roman religion was actually the iranian god mithra we should expect to find in iranian mythology a story in which mithra kills a bull however the fact is that no such iranian myth exists in no known iranian text does mithra have anything to do with killing a bull
2030935 no one can be sure that the meaning of the meals and the ablutions are the same between christianity and mithraism just because the two had them is no indication that they come to the same thing these are entirely superficial and circumstantial arguments
2030936 roman cult began after jesus life our earliest evidence for the mithraic mysteries places their appearance in the middle of the first century b c
2030937 the historian plutarch says that in 67 b c a large band of pirates based in cilicia

2030944 i am confident the team is up for it as we assemble next wednesday ahead of one of the greatest quests that exists in world rugby the challenge of winning test matches on south african soil
2030945 while that record of not winning in south africa since 2000 has no real relevance in terms of how the two test matches that lie ahead might unfold on the pitch it does highlight the special opportunity we have in front of us as we head to the republic
2030946 as far as our progress as a team goes the auckland experience was a setback but it need not be any more than that
2030947 i would like to think the reverse wont impact too greatly on the confidence that has been built up within the group but that is something well really only be able to judge retrospectively

2030971 scholars of this material generally subscribe that the use of a system of module and mass production accounts for the diversity the phrase was coined by the german art historian lothar ledderose in 2000 when he used it as the subtitle of his book which had an image of the terracotta army on its cover and contained a compelling thesis about the distinctive nature of creativity in china most commentators have picked up on the mass produced nature of the figures a display case in the exhibition shows a modern reconstruction in little clay figures of the production line it is modelled in the style of the socialist realist sculpture that was used in maos day to generate such vast agitprop dioramas of life size figures as rent collection courtyard portraying the ways of pre 1949 evil landlords or wrath of the serfs portraying the evil ways of the pre 1949 tibetan monastic establishment the point is not just mass production but the mass production of modular forms three types of plinth two types of leg set eight types of torso and so on which can be combined and recombined and combined again into a simulacrum of diversity this is not so much mass production in the sense of the industrial revolution as in the sense in which it is deployed by starbucks where everyone can think they are getting just what they want
2030972 i am grateful for the support of madison yancey and haywood counties
2030973 this was not a small request and i understand the apprehensions generated and appreciate their courage and trust we now have a commitment from eleven of fifteen counties and i am hopeful we can get at least two more on board maybe more as i have opportunities to get in front of folks and explain the effort for a town hall meeting and a chance to spread the message
2030974 i bare no ill will toward the counties that have disavowed our campaign
2030975 a different breed of politician who is very serious about reforming the party back to its foundation principles is a big pill to swallow as the only republican candidate covering the entire district i am the person realistically in a position to take urgent action on the need for a public rededication to our founding principles it has not been easy but the union of eleven out of fifteen counties makes a strong statement to the voters of the 11th district that the word republican stands for something they can count on

2030979 very few locals are prepared to accept positions on the bench the judiciary is being propped up by australians yet australian authorities are quite prepared to allow them to undermine constitutionalism in this country
2030980 while continuance of the rule of law is of vital importance to fiji the implicit bargain involved in accepting appointment to the highest court of that country by a military government the lawfulness of which is under significant challenge comes at too high a price
2030981 australian judges involved in the supreme court of fiji after the coup have had to consider the benefits gained from their continued contribution to the rule of law against the risk that they may be perceived to have made an implicit bargain with a government whose legality is in question
2030982 the impact of some of your members in fiji is negative and an affront to our constitution
2030983 knowingly accepted an unlawful position in a constitutionally unlawful regime
2030984 dr scutts acceptance of a judicial appointment to the fiji bench in our view undermines fijis constitution threatens a quick return to democracy and erodes the public confidence in a judiciary that is supposed to be independent and has credibility and integrity
2030985 on that assumption i have concluded that the acceptance of such an appointment would not of itself be regarded as disgraceful and dishonourable by members of sic legal profession being member sic of good repute and competency and would therefore not amount to professional misconduct

2031014 previously both wireless security and infrastructure vendors have focused on protecting the connection and the back end network while the perimeter where attacks cannot be detected has remained undefended
2031015 rf barrier mounts a strong defense by blocking signals from the designated wireless network from being effectively decoded outside the perimeter for example a retailer need no longer worry about the bleeding of its financial data beyond the walls of the building from legacy devices that dont support the newest and most advanced security standards as the first solution to provide cost effective perimeter wireless protection rf barrier can greatly expand the network managers confidence in the security of both legacy and modern wireless networks
2031016 our nokia wi fi smart phones handle sensitive voice calls as well as confidential emails and contact information
2031017 with our warehouse adjacent to an interstate highway and other major roads no one is comfortable with blasting a wi fi signal all over the place rf barrier lets us decide exactly where we want to draw the border around the coverage area and we know that the information stops right here and we can keep our infrastructure tuned to maximum power without worrying about the consequences of signal bleeding rf barrier dramatically reduces the risk of parking lot type security attacks and means we wont have to make excuses to management later

2031022 when kenny hulshof got into the race for governor he was more than 20 points behind steelman in the seventh congressional district
2031023 in mid july i believe you reported the survey usa findings that had hulshof down 19 points in the seventh
2031024 they say theyre up by 12 points in southwest missouri then roy blunt gets involved and they lose this is insane revisionist history
2031025 if wed a had more money wed a beat him in joplin too
2031026 when the votes were counted tuesday night he had closed that gap to just seven points against a very
2031027 i would argue that in southwest missouri one of the critical elements helping him close that gap was the late june endorsement campaigning and calls by the very
2031028 blunt lost hundreds of votes because of his endorsement of hulshof including mine we never need someone telling us how to vote 11th commandment never endorse in a primary
2031029 how many state reps endorsed kenny in the 7th district all of them but sarah still won despite the consistent campaigning against her down here in southwest missouri
2031030 aside from the blunt endorsement of hulshof kenny spent 90 of his time here in sw mo and spent more money here in sw mo than we did sarahs message trumped kennys in areas he was camped out in
2031031 if the turnout in his home district would have been a little less it would be a steelman nixon battle today just goes to show that you cannot underestimate the power of your own home turf
2031032 but looking at the differences between kenny and jay the choice is clear congrats kenny you have my vote

2031035 todays settlement sends a resounding message to the entire auction rate securities industry this type of deceptive behavior will not be tolerated
2031036 citi has worked diligently with issuers investors and regulatory authorities to obtain liquidity for holders of illiquid auction rate securities
2031037 by the end of the year every bank is going to have to buy these back from everybody
2031038 if youre going to arbitration over auction rate securities when other firms have already acknowledged everything and a few have already bought back others securities the cases become indefensible
2031039 theres still a big question mark as to how these institutions are going to pay for these securities at par
2031040 in four years many words are said and inversely fewer mean anything do the math the campaigns are but a sop to public delusions that the us is a democracy
2031041 our only political party has two right wings one called republican the other democratic but henry adams figured all that out back in the 1890s we have a single system he wrote and in that system the only question is the price at which the proletariat is to be bought and sold the bread and circuses the tragedy of the united states thus far in this century is not the crack up of an empire which we never knew what to do with in the first place but the collapse of the idea of the citizen as someone autonomous whose private life is not subject to orders from above since the reading skills of the american people are the lowest in the first world the general public is always prey to manipulation by television this means if you want to demonize drugs or the arabs or the japanese you do so openly in the media the oligarchy does not care whether the citizens make themselves sick with drugs or not what government wants is simple total control if this can be got by dispensing with the bill of rights then thats a small price for them to pay congress no longer declares war or makes budgets so thats the end of the constitution as a working machine

2031053 the bush administration denied a request to reduce the amount of ethanol that must be blended into the u s gasoline supply dealing a setback to food producers livestock ranchers and others who say the mandate is contributing to high food prices
2031054 the decision marks a victory for u s corn growers and ethanol makers but it is unlikely to settle the broader debate over u s biofuels policy and the degree to which the u s should continue to subsidize alternative fuels such as corn based ethanol within minutes of the administrations announcement groups representing poultry producers livestock farmers and other industries vowed to take their case to congress and the next presidential administration
2031055 the governments support for corn based ethanol has frustrated chicken and hog producers who say the mandate has increased the cost of feeding their livestock by diverting corn toward ethanol production and away from use as a feedstock
2031056 in recent months however policy makers around the globe have been under pressure to cut incentives for biofuels production as food price inflation has cut deeper into consumers pockets
2031057 the bush administration has been steadfast in its support for the ethanol industry which has bipartisan political backing throughout the midwest even before thursdays announcement some within the administration had expressed concern that easing the mandate would undercut private sector investment in biofuel technology
2031058 the environmental protection agency rejected on thursday a request to cut the federal governments quota for the use of ethanol in cars concluding at least for now that the national goal of reducing oil use trumps any effect on food prices from making fuel from corn
2031059 but food producers said that high prices for feed had already increased the price of meat and that they were cutting the size of herds and flocks meaning that supplies would soon be lower and prices higher
2031060 the food inflation that youve seen now at least in the meat and poultry sector probably is mild compared to what may be coming in the future said joel brandenberger president of the national turkey federation
2031061 he and others said they would go to congress to try to seek a reduction in the tax break for ethanol and a cut in tariffs on ethanol imports
2031062 epa administrator stephen l johnson said the agency did not examine the requirements impact on the environment because that was not the subject of the petition
2031063 so that is going to be a key element for the future he said
2031064 ethanol supporters applauded the ruling saying it is important to the industry because it keeps ethanol on track to advance beyond corn as a feedstock but livestock producers who have been paying higher costs for feed expressed their disappointment over the decision
2031065 representatives from the national cattlemens beef association the national pork producers council and the texas cattle feeders association said that despite the epa ruling there appears to be evidence that the rfs is harming livestock producers across the country
2031066 farmers are making the broadest cuts to their livestock herds in decades meaning meat at the supermarket will likely cost more in coming years middlemen are trying to shorten the duration of supply contracts to 90 days from one year so they can pass on higher costs more quickly and food brands are shrinking the contents of their packages from ice cream cartons to beverage containers
2031067 before the grain markets stirred in the summer of 2006 the price of corn had stayed below 3 a bushel for a decade in the space of two years it surged as high as 7 a bushel soybean and wheat made similar moves
2031068 global grain demand has outstripped production for much of this decade draining supplies to unusually low levels
2031069 in the past month the speculative fever has eased the corn futures contract for september delivery rose 14 25 cents a bushel to settle at 5 22 a bushel thursday still the efforts by ranchers bakers and meatpackers to shift the burden of higher grain prices show they think their raw material costs arent returning to their old levels soon
2031070 during the first six months of 2008 the consumer price index for food compiled by the u s bureau of labor statistics rose at a
2031071 in another measure the cost of the groceries that the federal government suggests middle class families buy to have healthy diets rose 8 6 in june compared with the same month a year earlier
2031072 michael swanson an economist at wells fargo amp co thinks the food inflation rate could rise as high as 6 next year paul prentice president of farm sector economics colorado springs colo said he expects retail food prices to rise about 7 5 in 2009 even under this more conservative forecast the average family of four would see its annual food costs hit 9 800 in 2009 up about 1 200 since 2006
2031073 cereal yields in the european union are expected to rise 16 percent this year compared with 2007 officials said thursday
2031074 higher yields should help calm grain prices which have surged over the past year because bad weather hit last years crop amid worries that a boom in biofuels would eat up more cereals
2031075 attracted by better prices farmers have planted 5 percent more land with cereal crops this year the european commission said
2031076 the yield forecast for cereals is 5 tonnes per hectare across the eu and thus significantly higher than last year and the average over the past five years
2031077 looking at individual crop figures across the eu27 over the past five years and as of august 5th 2008 the latest yield forecasts show the following trends
2031078 brazil will make an effort to promote the conclusion of the doha round of world trade organization talks within a remaining window of opportunity this year brazilian foreign relations minister celso amorim said thursday
2031079 speaking in a nationally broadcast radio interview amorim said the conclusion of the round was important to help eliminate agricultural subsidies abroad that restrict the competitiveness of local products
2031080 we might deem the latest cycle of talks a failure but the round can still be concluded in this small window of opportunity amorim said

2031082 a senior us trade official on wednesday defended the world trade organisation and the multilateral trading system in the wake of the latest collapse of negotiations for a new round of tariff cuts in a broad range of industries
2031083 even if the wto has become extremely unwieldy it would be crazy to walk away from doha unless there is something better said warren maruyama general counsel in the office of the us trade representative right now there is no plausible alternative
2031084 mr maruyama was seeking to dispel fears that the failure of high level talks would lead to a deterioration in international economic relations with rising protectionism around the world and the wto becoming increasingly irrelevant
2031085 the rising cost of fuel and other products helped drive u s farm production expenditures to a record 260 billion in 2007 according to the farm production expenditures 2007 summary released today by the u s department of agricultures national agricultural statistics service nass total u s farm production expenditures rose 9 3 percent from 2006 and nearly 30 percent from 5 years ago
2031086 increasing petroleum costs meant farmers not only paid more for fuel but also for fertilizer products chemicals and transportation services indirectly fuel prices and the growth in ethanol production also led to higher crop prices resulting in increased cost for livestock feed
2031087 the nass report shows that the average production expenditures per farm increased 10 percent nationwide from 114 186 in 2006 to 125 648 in 2007

2031099 house agriculture committee chairman collin peterson d minn says he is concerned that the recent downturn in farm commodity prices coupled with the escalation of farmland prices and input costs have the potential of developing into another farm crisis
2031100 speaking recently via satellite hookup to the 25th international sweetener symposium in hawaii peterson said these could be the start of trends that could prove harmful to the overall u s agricultural economy

2031147 maybe its because this is mckintys troubles book we have seen a hell of a lot of work based on the troubles ireland and the uk are coming down with ira stories some are better than others and in this case much better but at the end of the day people are looking for new settings and themes america however still has quite an interest in this kind of thing especially among the irish american communities with the luxury of distance they maybe have a romantic idea of the struggle and are open to more from this sub genre and mckinty has given it to them in spades

2031154 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs

2031164 its what i call vertical theatre rather then horizontal vertical because it comes from the ground up from the roots up and cares and attends to its own community but looks beyond that local community to an international one as opposed to a horizontal theatre which is basically planing along above the the ground aimed at a middle class national and international circuit
2031165 for us the start of the journey was to look at who wasnt going to the theatre and notice who they were on the whole the young and the poor and to begin to think about how the young and the poor might join with us to go somewhere exciting

2031193 that is a very very interesting question and yet it is a question i think we can answer
2031194 did mosquitoes exist yes in other words when you start working through the days of creation its clear that god created all the different orders of the animals and all the different orders of nature and that would include the bugs the insects and other things that we have to scratch our heads and wonder how gods glory is in them
2031195 in other words we know that gods glory is in the mosquito but when its biting on your arm or when its transmitting a disease its hard to see
2031196 same as the question of the tiger the lion the bear or any other carnivore or anything else that preys on any other being
2031197 after the fall we are told that when sin entered so also entered death
2031198 and to this little girl id just simply want to say before adam fell evidently the mosquito had no taste for blood
2031199 but after the fall as a sign of the curse of the awful sinfulness of sin the mosquitos diet changed what did they eat before that i dont know but something that did not represent death
2031200 i think theistic evolution fails as an intellectual claim at many different levels
2031201 the safest way i know to look at it is i think if you really understand evolution and you really understand theism that they are incompatible rather than compatible
2031202 that to me is the big problem with theistic evolution
2031203 even if it were coherent intellectually it still would fail to meet the storyline of the bible because theistic evolution requires death death death death before there would be anything like a fall
2031204 so not only do you have to come up with a creative way of interpreting the first 11 chapters of genesis in terms of history
2031205 you also have to reinterpret the theology of the passage because you no longer have death coming as result of the fall when the historical figures of adam and eve took of the fruit that was forbidden
2031206 if you dont have that then how if you are mythologizing the first adam do you then rightly understand the second adam
2031207 have to be tested not only by verse by verse study of the bible but against the big picture of the bible and the storyline of the gospel creation fall redemption consummation
2031208 if you redefine the fall because you redefine creation then inevitably you redefine redemption and youve redefined consummation
2031209 when you start thinking about for instance how the new testament interprets the old the fall and death coming as result of the fall is not only a genesis 3 issue its a central new testament issue

2031229 were knights of the round table we ham and jam and scramalot
2031230 it is against such treatment and the underlying attitudes that organisations such as the fiji womens crisis centre have campaigned vigorously over the last two decades or so
2031231 i say that to remind myself that society condemns such callous and humiliating behaviour against women and i have a duty to pass a sentence that accounts for that
2031232 quite the contrary whens the last time you read him
2031233 if it were possible i would like to devote the 50 minutes of every class meeting to mute meditation concentration and admiration of dickens
2031234 my mother read secondarily for information she sank as a hedonist into novels she read dickens in the spirit in which she would have eloped with him
2031235 until old hungerfordmarket was pulled down until old hungerford stairs were destroyed and the very nature of the ground changed i never had the courage to go back to the place where my servitude began i never saw it i could not endure to go near it

2031242 u 2 r so pretty i luv u both oxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo from ur biggest fan eva
2031243 let me emphasize that its going to be fast but its going to be fair
2031244 we now live in a separate economy we live on a separate level to the vast majority of people in the country we dont send our kids to the same schools we have more choice over schools we have more choice over health we have more choice over where we live we have more choice over where we go on holiday and what we do for our jobs and we live in a completely different world to the people we live next door to
2031245 while this turn of events had multiple causes and contributing factors the root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and the downside of the cycle is collective human behavior unbridled optimism on the upside and fear bordering on panic on the downside as history tells us in unmistakable terms it is virtually impossible to anticipate when optimism gives rise to fear or fear gives rise to optimism the last twelve months have been no exception to this sobering reality
2031246 the conflict is not our problem we are muslims but not really full article taliban do as we say or our children detonate
2031247 archbishop is helping muslim men oppress women say black feminists
2031248 democrats kill ban on terrorists in schools citizens should be outraged lawmakers are playing
2031249 this anticipation supported the market so that we didnt see any big falls last month but faith collapsed a couple of hours ahead of the games
2031250 confidence in building positions became very shaky especially for those short term buyers who are very sensitive to government support
2031251 there are investors who bought these stocks on the hope that beijing would rescue the markets before the olympics and that these stocks would rise more sharply
2031252 if you are the head of the washington apple growers association you may be interested in this
2031253 it gives you much better insights in terms of whats happening on a geographic basis potentially allowing advertisers to target geographically
2031254 we have been using it as a research tool to give us some insight into the relative importance of different terms that people may be using to search on a particular subject
2031255 we are also very interested in uses like the economic forecasting finance sociological studies even in etymological studies to track how new words spread in the population
2031256 tonight is the last night of any beijing that we ever really knew
2031257 whenever i hear people say clean food is expensive i tell them it s actually the cheapest food you can buy
2031258 as for mitch i think those kinds of fears are a bit premature but even so hunger in the world today is an economic problem not a supply problem we throw away huge amounts of food in the us right now we have a ways to go before shortage is the problem
2031259 most factory meat farms produce way too much manure that may not be the case in your area but it is in the rest of the us this manure leads to nitrogen rich run off poisoning our rivers and oceans also your high yield corn farmers rely on petroleum for their fertilizer not on organic manure this is completely unsustainable much more so than organic farming can wide scale organic farming feed the world i have no clue but i can certainly tell you that our current industrial food chain cannot
2031260 furthermore without antibiotics a sick or injured cow will experience more pain and suffering without the drugs there is no way to control parasites worms infections or illness cows with treatable illnesses must get better on their own or they will be slaughtered or sold to another farm where they can get the medicine they need
2031261 i would support laws that regulated factory farming mandated reduced pesticide levels on produce and implemented tougher anti cruelty laws for farmed animals until these measures are put in place on a legislative level companies will continue to provide what most consumers want which is cheap food
2031262 until theses measures are put in place companies will provide what most consumers want
2031263 2 organic produce production is far less efficient than modern methods so the farms use more land and more fuel to produce their crops even locally grown produce isn t always the answer as sometimes these crops can have a larger carbon footprint than something produced elsewhere
2031264 the reason i brought this up is that the people i know who are the most vocal supporters of organic farming are also the type who claim to care about world hunger but like many on here they choose to ignore warnings from people like norman borlaug nobel laureate world s foremost expert on food production hunger because it s easier to shell out 20 to whatever organization than it is to research the topic beyond what the latest bestseller tells you
2031265 i don t think there are studies showing that use of rbst or rghb alters the chemical composition of milk in any way at least i haven t heard of any earlier fda studies found no effect these hormones are naturally occuring in all cow s milk

2031267 only 17 residents remained in the 51 unit cedars point building along northwest 15th street and 16th avenue after the housing market went bust and those living there were left to try to manage the building on their own after tuesdays near forced evacuation only 10 remain the others will stay at hotels with aid from the salvation army until they find some other form of shelter
2031268 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2031269 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2031270 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2031271 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2031272 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2031273 are you truly supporting sen obama and encouraging your supporters to do the same or are you just saying what you have to
2031274 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee
2031275 were not talking to those people were talking directly to the clinton campaign people and staff
2031276 today charlottes two big banks are busy defending their actions to analysts and holding off angry shareholders in banktown its safe to say everyone is on edge
2031277 in order to really get at the issue is there life out there we have to know the best place to look
2031278 and in the case of europa the best place to look is where cracks on its icy surface are active today

2031286 people all over the globe seem to identify with one aspect of our music or another
2031287 whether it be a song about working class people where we come from or our sports teams people seem to understand what were singing about
2031288 obviously some of the red sox stuff is over the heads of people in some countries but for the most part people seem to be hip to it
2031289 as far as the songs being about boston weve had people tell us that the pride we have in our city makes them proud to be wherever theyre from
2031290 the words to shipping up to boston were at the woody guthrie archives where ken had the opportunity to go to once
2031291 he got to sift through all sorts of songs and poems that were never published
2031292 obviously having our name anywhere near scorseses is an honor
2031293 to have him actually say the name dropkick murphys on television was something none of us ever thought we would experience the whole thing was mind blowing and still is to this day
2031294 if i wrote that into a story screenplay novel etc the editor director producer etc would throw it out and say its implausible

2031300 after 6 years of intense collaboration with our client cctv our chinese partners ecadi and the engineers of arup we are very pleased to see the successful completion of the exterior of the project on time for the olympics as the building now stands visibly in the city it has added the three dimensional figure of a loop to beijings skyline of towers it appears big yet sometimes small and from every angle offers a completely different perspective and reading we are hopeful to see the building emerge as a symbol of collaboration and change

2031310 we have a unique situation here in that we live in close proximity to a major urban city and they would appreciate a chance to tour the natural foods farms
2031311 i am in awe i didnt realize how much history there is in that community and how rich it is in culture there are many other artists in that community
2031312 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down i discovered this doing a forensic examination of an iphone 3g it appears to be tucked away in a configuration file deep inside corelocation
2031313 we hope to get a response soon because we agreed that we cannot continue under such conditions
2031314 last season we were transporting cane to the mills with a fuel price of 1 52 a litre but now it is 2 39 a litre there is not much money we make to help our families because most of it goes for fuel and maintenance
2031315 if we do not receive any assistance then we have no other choice but to protest by not providing the service any more
2031316 the cost of everything is increasing while sugar preferential prices are dropping so how can they expect us to continue in the industry without any assistance

2031322 for all the governments attempts to paint the commissions as another nuremberg they remain utterly outside the law and will be mired in challenges for years to come
2031323 hamdan was convicted based on laws that were passed long after he was picked up and the commission allowed coerced evidence both illegal under not only international law but u s law as well
2031324 hamdans trial revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention only to face a process that falls far short so far the trial continues the bush administrations efforts to escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice
2031325 the trial was a show trial the rules of evidence are so tilted in the governments favour that the tribunal is ill designed for getting at truth
2031326 its hard to credit any verdict though its telling that the executive failed to win the entire case even in its contrived system
2031327 that however in no way proves the system is fair or that it works
2031328 this is an enormously compelling indication of how independent the process has been
2031329 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan
2031330 the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the uniform code of military justice and the four geneva conventions signed in 1949

2031338 here i am saying im sorry i was recalcitrant in private because i am playful but proud too challenged in public the temptation to give in to you is strong i cant resist
2031339 so i beg you forgive me and accept this public display of a private pride that gives in to your rage as an act of love just one of many

2031342 training camps and the preseason are a curious winnowing process where fans must hope the best player plays the best and is not unseated by someone less deserving
2031343 mommy its just about almost only 2 more groups of seven days til school starts coming on monday
2031344 we know we want someone who will work well with the community and the teachers and who loves and believes in columbia public schools
2031345 its bad when you dont know what youre doing but we have lots of good community resources
2031346 especially for a district like columbia its a time consuming process
2031347 i think thats why most boards when facing this decision do hire the services of consultants even with consultants it takes a tremendous amount of time for school board members who are unpaid volunteers especially for a board that has not been through this process before
2031348 it may spook some but the person we need for this job is someone who will know how to handle columbia
2031349 we are home to the most outstanding journalism school in the country we have an outstanding press corps across the community and they report well our community wants to know whats going on and that does not happen in some communities where they allow elected officials and those who run institutions to do what they need to do without paying much attention this is not a community thats hands off

2031351 its wrong of the islamic council to wait for the
2031352 im 100 percent certain that the fatwa council will not come out in favour something which conflicts with european law the council wasnt able to deal with the question of homosexuality this time but it thinks that subject is quite relevant and wants to look at the matter more
2031353 its very important to have the european fatwa council with us in difficult matters like this i am not in favour of the death penalty but there are islamic texts that various people understand differently this is why we need to know the attitude of the authority before we make a decision
2031354 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2031355 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2031356 we are trying work all this through with the democratic national committee and with the obama campaign
2031357 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
2031358 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2031359 its important that her supporters have a voice in some way
2031360 she is a duly registered candidate who got a lot of votes and she is going to do what she wants to do
2031361 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2031362 we have seen over the winter and the spring more and more interest for federal politics and more and more appetite for an election so we will see what will happen in the coming months
2031363 mr dion must decide to fish or cut bait either let the current parliament work and let us go on with our mandate or the voters themselves will decide

2031368 the worker at the restaurant didnt even come to tell me all of this herself but went to my assistant instead i was angry because i am a human being and i have rights
2031369 i interpolate here to say that in this context i have had no interference from the executive or any branch of the government or any outside source
2031370 a judge therefore has to be independent not only from interference from outside but also from the baggage and ignorance within himself
2031371 we look forward to operating the 787 and benefiting from its advanced performance features
2031372 however the 767 300er is the economical and logical choice to fulfill our interim capacity targets
2031373 the goal of this design contest was to help raise awareness for jdrf and with over 84 000 in donations from people from all across the country i think we accomplished that goal

2031375 we are very excited at how much support was shown from within jdrf and for jdrf from people all across the country through the online car design contest
2031376 were very grateful to the motorcraft and quick lane employees at ford for helping get us closer to our goal of finding a cure for type 1 diabetes

2031383 its sic essential for the american people to know the facts about what is happening in iraq some media outlets and certain politicians still fail to assess the situation objectively so vets for freedom is heading back to iraq to let them know what has been accomplished what still needs to be done and how we should proceed in order to attain sustainable security in iraq
2031384 you can have your tiger woods weve got sen mccain
2031385 theres no broad statement that you can make that you cant have somebody who works with an organization involved in a campaign
2031386 if essentially you have reporters who are the founders and the activists in the organization then getting credentialed and going with preconceptions and then going out and campaigning thats highly questionable and that deserves scrutiny it seems to me that to some extent the question is is there any chance that any of them change their views or is it simply a kind of a fraud
2031387 minimum levels of affordable housing and employment opportunities that must remain in areas adjacent to planned olympic facilities
2031388 while many people are excited about chicagos opportunity to host the 2016 olympic games we want to ensure that south side communities arent pushed out
2031389 as we move through the planning stages of the bid we encourage anyone who has concerns to contact us to start a dialogue
2031390 we believe everyone in chicago will see the lasting positive impact the games will have on our communities

2031406 a news and media blog in the libertarian tenor with limited government overtones facilitating the flow of ideas information e commerce and inspiration within the democratic republics of the world
2031407 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
2031408 commerce with all nations alliance with none should be our motto
2031409 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
2031410 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
2031411 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon
2031412 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
2031413 we firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries

2031415 chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law these facts are well known regarding the sino u s differences on issues including human rights and religion we have always insisted on dialogue and communication based on mutual equality and mutual respect in order to enhance understanding reduce differences and to expand consensus
2031416 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
2031417 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2031418 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2031419 has placed america in a better position to be honest and direct on other issues
2031420 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
2031421 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2031422 growth sparked by chinas free market reforms is good for the chinese people
2031423 chinas new purchasing power is also good for the world because it provides an enormous market for exports from across the globe
2031424 act responsibly on issues such as energy the environment and african development
2031425 discuss ways to ensure long term growth and widely shared prosperity in both our economies as well as issues like currency exchange rates and intellectual property rights
2031426 we dont really read most of the bills do you know what that would entail if we read every bill that we passed
2031427 and hes commanded his slider a little bit more its more consistent with the tilt to it hes not hanging as many hes more consistent hes got a better feel for it that just comes with repetition

2031439 we are expecting the unexpected our preparations are constantly changing
2031440 climate change must be a wholly legitimate subject of protest and demonstration but if it is met by an arbitrary destructive and aggressive police response the consequences will undoubtedly be a continued alienation between police and many decent law abiding people particularly the young
2031441 what we are doing is part of a long tradition of civil disobedience
2031442 were not blas about breaking the law but the threat that new coal poses to our future on this planet more than justifies the actions we are taking
2031443 the searches have been absurdly over the top with everything from 26 foot banners to disabled access ramps taken away
2031444 its a concerted attempt to demonise people and alienate members of the public so they dont think it is safe to come here its a depressing a chilling attack on the right to freedom of expression and assembly
2031445 the climate change debate in the workshop was of a higher calibre than in the house of commons
2031446 from the moment the first concrete is poured to build the proposed new power station there will be a rolling blockade
2031447 this act the federal reserve act dec 23rd 1913 establishes the most gigantic trust on earth when the president woodrow wilson signs the bill the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalised the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill
2031448 i feel for anyone trying to sell homes in the current market including sawtooth
2031449 but for them to ask the court to pin sawtooths inability to sell their modular homes on a couple of bloggers and regular homeowners is incredulous
2031450 i think if his business has been hurt its been his business practices that hurt it i believe some call it karma didnt have smooth sailing with our subdivision so he has to go after us individually
2031451 the future relationship between materials and technologies in product fundamentalism vol 2
2031452 in a world of mergers and acquisitions a strategic alliance like this is not uncommon
2031453 we see the relationship with tank n tummy as a good fit it is an opportunity to grow both our businesses the reason for that is we do fuel distributions and supply really good and they do convenience stores operations really well
2031454 whether this really is a facebook worm and not simply malware being distributed via facebook spam remains to be seen
2031455 companies need to make their own mind up as to whether they want to allow their users to access websites like facebook and myspace during office hours
2031456 weve been doing quite a lot in the past few months to pre empt any issues of student misbehaviour
2031457 a drop that is happening worldwide due to a decrease in the uptake of government scholarships
2031458 their numbers have decreased drastically this year they come here mostly to have fun but things were blown out of proportion a bit last summer
2031459 we request our students staying in hostels and student residences to sign a logbook upon their return at night if they dont respect the curfew we would know we call them in speak to them and follow it up
2031460 there are definitely better controls this year host families are enforcing curfew times that are immediately made clear to the students you obviously get the odd student who sleeps out at night and skips classes the next day but this is followed up immediately
2031461 if the students are not adults then they will be the responsibility of the school during lessons or at events organised by the school they have to be accompanied by teachers or local leaders and in cases of student groups they might have foreign leaders on excursions or night activities
2031462 if these are not respected there are set disciplinary procedures starting from speaking to the students concerned and contacting their parents and agencies in extreme cases when they keep breaking the rules and pose a threat to themselves to other students or to public peace they are repatriated
2031463 its a way of taking them out of paceville and away from densely inhabited areas
2031464 screening by breast self examination or physical examination cannot be recommended
2031465 be encouraged to seek medical advice if they detect any change in their breasts that may be breast cancer
2031466 bse while not proven to save lives is the one detection method that women have control over with their own two hands
2031467 there is still a large gap between rural and urban telephone growth as highlighted in the book due to flawed policy implementation at the time of writing
2031468 are not as bad off in terms of rural telecom use
2031469 indonesia is ahead of india in terms of penetration but not growth while nepal is the only country out of those covered in the book which is far behind india in terms of penetration
2031470 this being said some of the inhibiting policy factors that were highlighted in some of the chapters which have contributed to this large urban rural divide are changing now for example the adc access deficit charge has been eliminated
2031471 overall we think india has a more robust policy and regulatory system than others though of course it could be better the very powerful role of the department of telecom is problematic
2031472 the book looks at the recent experiences of some countries in emerging asia improving connectivity the central argument is that connectivity is held back not by technology but by policy and regulatory barriers
2031473 a think tank that seeks to advance evidence based policy making
2031474 currently we focus on south asia but we seek to cover the entire asia pacific our work on regulation is driven by the idea that what is appropriate for our countries are simple easy to implement low cost methodologies
2031475 that is one reason we are developing alternative methods of regulation based on benchmarks the comparative data that we have developed can be used for benchmark regulation
2031476 the lessons one draws from it are likely to be of great interest to many
2031477 in terms of the five countries south asian that we look at all the five countries have seen growth in their gsm sectors of more than 40 percent between september 2006 and january 2008
2031478 the process used to disburse the little that had been disbursed by that time though highly transparent was biased in favour of the incumbent
2031479 the success of grameen phone can be attributed to its leasing of nation wide infrastructure from bangladesh railways which allowed it to roll out rapidly gaining a critical mass of subscribers
2031480 we do not want or need more breast cancer research funding at the expense of smart breast cancer research funding
2031481 for the first time in my life i had good instructors for improvisation over there they have systems for working with it that sort of thing is just starting here the other thing was that i could meet with great jazz musicians who were giving master classes and or lecturing as artists in residence
2031482 timing to me is what distinguishes good musicians they can have the same licks but if the timing or rhythm isnt right to the jazz feeling then it doesnt move me so i practiced and focused on rhythm
2031483 well i like country music too also ive heard brian blades drummers group fellowship and i love the way he combines pedal steel and jazz

2031492 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
2031493 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
2031494 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2031495 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in how solar energy is distributed throughout the polluted regions of our atmosphere
2031496 capmex takes his work an important step forward with new innovative micro and nano sensor technologies that will provide additional quantitative estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region

2031510 mississauga has one of the largest canadian polish communities anywhere from 100 000 to 120 000
2031511 but what is interesting is according to the latest census report there are over one million people in canada with some polish roots in canada and i think we can be proud of our contribution to this country
2031512 the youth mobility agreement is an agreement that will allow under a special program youth from each country to learn about the other countrys culture customs geography all the good things

2031514 i was told our site should be for the average joe so joe barter get it
2031515 the largest barter companies are relatively small about 14 million each in revenue per year
2031516 that it conserves cash for a small business and it brings in customers
2031517 in a small business you have to pay cash for your mortgage and insurance and other necessities
2031518 distribution is the key to the business expanding the member network so we can offer more services
2031519 the idea for the barter business hit me when i traded one of my baldwin pianos for a mercury cougar
2031520 the two were comparably priced but i had paid wholesale for the piano and got retail value for it so there is leverage in the barter business and that is one of its attractions
2031521 we tell them to drum up business trading doesnt happen unless you make it happen
2031522 we can target more specific groups im going to hire people to market across the country

2031533 it is my view that the criminal division here requires more than one judge with periodic assistance from a judge from suva
2031534 i sit today for the last time as a judge and it is not without a tinge of regret that i will be leaving you and this country where my grandfather was born and to which i have great sentimental attachment
2031535 the work load here has by no means been light
2031536 in most of the cases where the offences were electable the accused invariably elected high court trial knowing fully well that the trial would probably die a natural death
2031537 this is not the situation anymore as we have more accused people electing a magistrates court trial because they know that trials in the high court would be dealt with expeditiously as justice govind had been able to get rid of the huge backlog
2031538 oh if you bring luggage youll need to tip the handlers because were not going to pay them

2031540 you can randomize the identifier for the packet and you can randomize the port number but the bad news about randomization is the birthday paradox
2031541 if you have 20 people in a room the chances are that two of them will share the same birthday thats the problem if youre choosing at random and an attacker is choosing at random if you are using two to the sixteen 65536 samples and an attacker is sending samples at the rate of the square root of two to the sixteen which is two to the eight 256 the attacker has a 50 percent chance of success
2031542 puts off the dreadful day when the attacker can send packets fast enough to overcome entropy
2031543 you only find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out
2031544 diversification is a protection against ignorance it makes very little sense for those who know what theyre doing
2031545 if its your game diversification doesnt make sense its crazy to put money into your 20th choice rather than your 1st choice if you have lebron james on your team dont take him out of the game just to make room for someone else if you have a harem of 40 women you never really get to know any of them well
2031546 ask without fear an evening with fundraiser and author marc a pitman
2031547 the alternative that the opposition proposes is harmful for the country and im not saying were perfect appointing an interim government leading talks for a new cabinet and organizing early elections would take precious time for work with eu funds

2031554 macarthur believes that the best way for pastors to positively impact society is to do what god has called them to do which is to convert people not try to redeem society welch cannot point to a single verse in the bible instructing pastors to be politically active but macarthur can point to dozens instructing pastors to preach the word of god not the words of jefferson and to embrace spiritual warfare with spiritual weapons not competing bumper stickers

2031560 the christian based school would have to teach the ontario curriculum which of course has a different explanation its still called the theory of evolution but they teach evolution in the ontario curriculum but they could also mention to children the fact that there are other theories out there that are part of some christian beliefs
2031561 just growing up around it so much i think we all loved airplanes
2031562 we loved being around airplanes going up in airplanes hearing about them

2031573 we feel an obligation to help open the door to allow for more of our brothers and sisters to enter
2031574 it is a labor of love rooted in creating social change
2031575 they explain what it takes to come to college especially here
2031576 universities can reach out but they have to reach out to everyone
2031577 were focusing on students with low income and disadvantaged backgrounds
2031578 last year there were 10 counties from california that did not send a single student to berkeley ten
2031579 there is some additional flexibility afforded to students in terms of their outreach and how they design outreach
2031580 we call the schools and get the demographics of how many african americans go to that school then we put together thousands of packets with fliers like an introduction to the university financial aid how to write essays
2031581 we go to the classes that have never heard of berkeley before
2031582 they are passionate about what theyre doing because they care
2031583 the students have seen the need for greater diversity and have taken it upon themselves to assist and supplement the universitys effort links to the texas education agency statutes amp regulations links to select publications by angela valenzuela
2031584 they recognize theres a market out there but that they dont understand it
2031585 theyre letting us sell it as if it were a unit

2031587 a 6 million advertising buy on nbc universals olympic coverage which begins tonight
2031588 by treating illegal low wage workers as a de facto criminal class the government is trying to inflate the menace they pose to a level that justifies its rabid efforts to capture and punish them
2031589 this is all in preparation for the operational evaluation opeval to be conducted in the south florida test facility this september
2031590 ive been working in mine warfare for at least 15 years and this is some of the most advanced equipment ive seen
2031591 in the past we did our reconnaissance leading with our nose so to speak and when our first ship encountered a mine that became the heads up to call in our dedicated mcm ships and mh 53e minehunting helicopter squadrons
2031592 the rms is actually comprised of five subsystems there is the remote minehunting vehicle rmv the an aqs 20a q 20 towed sensor for minehunting detection and identification the launch and recovery system the data link system half of which is on the rmv the other half positioned aboard ship and the software called the remote minehunting functional segment rmfs which resides within the combat system aboard ship
2031593 inside the rmv there is a cable that can lower the q 20 towed sonar body or the q 20 can function while hull mounted to the rmv the q 20 is usually streamed out to hunt using its sensors it then transmits its signals back to us we see the images in real time on consoles aboard ship and then we also record the data so we can then perform post mission analysis
2031594 the miw mission package will be comprised of two rmss each able to operate in tandem and effectively doubling the search area and rate
2031595 the asw mission module also receives two rmvs except were changing the nomenclature to remote multi mission vehicles rmmv because it will be carrying asw sensors
2031596 the idea is we will have a common rmmv where we will literally be able to swap out sensors whether for mine warfare or anti submarine warfare whichever is needed
2031597 for the past 10 years we have designed industry niche products to perfectly match flat panel displays
2031598 the leon ethos has always been to give custom installers the versatility to design systems that fit individual needs the profile 404 x a gives the option of not only matching any tv but also wood floors or any wall paint color it not only looks great next to the display but it stands on its own as an incredible two channel solution that customers will want to show off
2031599 everyone irrespective of age experience or culture has equally something to give and gain from each other
2031600 for the next 30 seconds give all udp packets with source port 12345 destined for ip1 a new source port of 48567 and all packets to ip2 a new source port of 34432 etc

2031602 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
2031603 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose
2031604 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
2031605 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia

2031608 all californians should be proud that we were the first state in the nation to desegregate
2031609 what they went through on our behalf is almost mind boggling to me as a history professor
2031610 as an educator i have a little bit of heartburn with the state dictating the curriculum but as someone who has been on committees in the past looking for inclusion of broad relevant topics and in teaching american history omitting the role of filipinos in u s history is like are you kidding me
2031611 it would be a travesty to lose all of these
2031612 like civil rights and huge moments in american history by neglect theyll fall out of american history books
2031613 all the stats show that over the last 20 to 30 years knowledge of students and younger people of american history government and current affairs has fallen dramatically from earlier eras
2031614 theyre going to be asked to vote and they should learn more about how to analyze issues across the spectrum not just one point of view but all across issues
2031615 students may have learned answers to the outdated curriculum and passed the test very well
2031616 but may not have relevant information as to what theyll need in the next 10 years if were missing key new standards
2031617 current law provides necessary flexibility for schools to provide instruction on anything not expressly prohibited by the education code

2031625 hess contributed to both candidates before april 7 1972 when an election financing disclosure law took effect
2031626 but he made the nixon contributions after he apparently had concluded correctly that sen george mcgovern d s d was destined to head the democratic ticket
2031627 no person shall make a contribution in the name of another person or knowingly permit his name to effect such a contribution and no person shall knowingly accept a contribution made by one person in the name of another person
2031628 mr hess was fundraising before sen mccain made the announcement
2031629 turns out that hess executives arent the only ones who gave such huge sums to elect mccain generosity towards mccain apparently extends down into lower levels of hess staff
2031630 this is my favorite candidate i fully acknowledge that the donation was done by myself personally my own doing
2031631 hess has clammed up and is refusing to explain what happened
2031632 the bundle of 2 300 and 4 600 checks that poured into sen john mccains presidential campaign on march 12 came from an unlikely group of california donors a mechanic from d amp d auto repair in whittier the manager of taco bell stores in riverside the owners of a liquor store in colton

2031644 we know its expensive to build the garage but live up to your promises
2031645 tronics focus has been abstraction one of the reasons were interested in it is because we want to explore how far a form can be transformed and still be recognizable to the human eye
2031646 it is out of the question for us to use 800 liters of water in the production of one pair of jeans
2031647 stan called me and said you got to fire this guy

2031659 die aua r ckt mit dem klimarechner die klimasch digenden auswirkungen des flugverkehrs ins bewusstsein ihrer kunden das ist ein schritt in die richtige richtung
2031660 es geht uns nicht darum auf die aua zu schlagen sondern es liegt uns etwas daran der ffentlichkeit ins bewusstsein zu rufen dass die mobilit t eben folgen f r die umwelt hat
2031661 wenn man sich das unrichtige ergebnis ansieht kommt man zum schluss dass das fliegen ohnehin nicht so klimasch dlich ist das entspricht aber nicht den tatsachen
2031662 wenn man schon einen solchen emissionsrechner installiert sollte dieser der realit t entsprechen
2031663 es ist ein genereller trend dass sich fluggesellschaften dem problem der treibhausgasemissionen stellen
2031664 allerdings sollte man dann davon ausgehen dass dies auch den tatsachen entspricht
2031665 diese kritik betrifft allerdings nicht nur die aua die luftfahrtindustrie insgesamt betreibt immer noch massives lobbying um die wahren ausma e ihres beitrags zu den treibhausemissionen zu verschleiern
2031666 auch die internationale zivilluftfahrt organisation icao preist einen emissionsrechner der viele faktoren unber cksichtigt l sst
2031667 wir als ngos werden am welttourismustag am 27 september eine petition gegen diesen dumping emissions rechner der welttourismus organisation unwto bergeben

2031669 there was a feeling that these photos needed to be shown
2031670 they wanted them so they could identify the people in the photos and punish them
2031671 it is a unique reportage if we consider it from a world view how one man covered one event so widely in the middle of everything
2031672 he took about 10 000 photos in one week it is amazing how great they are considering he was just starting out in his career
2031673 it is interesting that he didnt earn his respect as a photographer through these photos
2031674 it was more for his series on gypsies and his projects called exile and chaos
2031675 seeing images of being violent tough and macho also goes against being able to have caring connected relationships when they grow up

2031681 se ha avanzado en distintos tipos de paridad pero falta la m s importante es la participaci n pol tica equilibrada de hombres y mujeres tanto en los partidos como en cargos de representaci n popular para que no haya ninguna disparidad abusiva si uno ve en el parlamento tenemos muy pocas mujeres y eso evidencia que no hay suficiente representaci n de mujeres
2031682 lo m s raro es que en cualquier distrito la mayor a de dirigentes de juntas de vecino comit s de adelanto etc tera son mujeres
2031683 no warship or vessel of the enemy will be safe within a 300 kilometer radius of irans borders
2031684 this weapon is completely iranian built and according to our information no other country has used this technology before
2031685 about their military weapons and their military capabilities and saying how unique they are but they are usually just standard military weapons
2031686 i had a look through the different types of antiship missiles which exist in the world and there are not many that have a 300 kilometer range we knew as far back as 2005 that the iranians were buying a russian antiship missile called club and it is in that range category
2031687 so youd think that for a planned purchase being announced in 2005 2008 sounds about right for the hardware being delivered and now being flight tested
2031688 in its new hardball mode mccains team distributed tire gauges labeled obama energy plan underlining the campaigns contention that obama offered nothing but more air

2031693 inflate your tires and you will save as much oil as you could produce by drilling
2031694 we think we have a number of guys that we think have a chance
2031695 i dont think we have to rush anybody thats one of our strengths
2031696 the question with darren going into camp is playing time
2031697 in the stanley cup playoffs about five minutes a game is big time but we hope that he can become a real good third line center in the nhl and we have to decide in training camp what is best for his development is it to play 16 18 minutes a night in grand rapids of the ahl or to play five minutes in detroit were going to make that assessment after exhibition season
2031698 hes got very good hockey sense and hes a deceptive skater
2031699 we project him to be a top two line player but hes going to have to take time to develop
2031700 hell stay in sweden and should be in the swedish elite league full time this year which is a big step for him
2031701 thats like going to grand rapids well monitor progress from there and decide in a year if hes ready or if he still needs another year before coming over hes a very hard working real solid third line type of guy hes going to be a shutdown type of guy
2031702 the first year in the ahl you get your feet wet the second year you want to see some progress now the third year you have to start knocking on that door he had an outstanding training camp last year and went to grand rapids and had an up and down year
2031703 he came over from sweden this year and that was a big step for him
2031704 he did fairly well the big thing now is does he go forward this year stay the same or go backward he has high end skills and has to learn to take it to the net more
2031705 he just wasnt comfortable in north america yet were going to leave him in sweden and see if he can get his game going over there and then bring him over here hes got a chance with skills to be a second line guy but it will depend on development
2031706 he was a real good college player and we think he can be a real good second or third line nhl player
2031707 hes big and hes strong he likes to play physical our team is built with skill he doesnt have that skill but hes got the physical dimension and hes going to be that third line guy that can play left wing or center he finishes checks and hes also mentally strong hell chip the puck in
2031708 he was a second round pick and hes a forward prospect well leave in sweden he has a high ceiling
2031709 he was a second round pick and hes a forward prospect well leave in sweden
2031710 i thought he had a real tough first half of the year defensively
2031711 he was a big minus player but he realized that you have to be good in your own zone he has to get physically stronger hes a long shot to make our team out of camp next year because of our depth at defense but his strength is his ability to go back and get the puck and make the first pass which is so valuable in todays game
2031712 they think hes ready to play i think circumstances were one reason why he didnt play but if we had two guys injured they would throw him right in there they think hes ready to be an nhl player
2031713 hes still learning what to do in his own zone but we like his natural skills like skating ability ability to join the rush hockey sense and his hands
2031714 growing up he was a winger and he converted to defense so you know he can skate and handle the puck
2031715 hes still learning what to do in his own zone but we like his natural skills like skating ability ability to join the rush hockey sense and his hands hes got to get physically stronger his dad is a big man and were hoping he can grow into his body
2031716 he was a real good college goalie at maine he was then the top ahl rookie goalie but then he struggled he came back this year and wound up playing in the ahl all star game and was the ahl goalie of the month in december being a good pro is about being a good player for a long stretch of time its not about having a good weekend
2031717 we liked other players but given that dominik hasek is retiring and chris osgood is 35 years of age it was one area that we thought it was a good time to get depth
2031718 he plays deep in his net like a lot of those european guys do its time for him to come a little further out of his net part of being a good goalie is blocking areas and you cant rely on reflexes in the nhl because the players are so good
2031719 i saw him in vancouver at the world juniors about three years ago and i saw him this year play a game in the swedish elite league
2031720 he has real good lateral movement good legs and a good glove he needs to get out of his net a bit he plays deep in his net like a lot of those european guys do its time for him to come a little further out of his net part of being a good goalie is blocking areas and you cant rely on reflexes in the nhl because the players are so good
2031721 everything we saw was diametrically opposed to the rumors that we heard before we went
2031722 it was important that we went and saw for ourselves we saw a clean modern and friendly environment we asked a lot of questions and spoke to many workers we were impressed by what we saw and what we heard

2031734 this does not mean that we will put the brakes on the immediate posting of breaking news that puts us first in a competitive web marketplace on the contrary
2031735 protecting the past is no strategy for the future it is suicide it is murder you should be ashamed of yourselves

2031740 todays guilty plea represents another important chapter in a joint investigation that led to the breakup of one of the most lucrative prostitution schemes ever uncovered in southern california
2031741 the fact this defendant agreed to forfeit more than 12 million in assets as part of her plea is a testament to the scope of this criminal scheme
2031742 the cooperative effort in this investigation shows how federal and local law enforcement is committed to combating prostitution activity that crosses state lines
2031743 irs criminal investigation will aggressively follow the money trail and forfeit assets purchased with illicit funds generated by prostitution operations

2031754 the plan is for us to be there for six months at a time and to marry our rotations with our army rotations
2031755 since we have no chinook capability at home and all the chinooks will be in afghanistan everybody being trained is going to end up over there
2031756 what were getting here is exactly what the u s army pilots get
2031757 it is currently the most capable battlefield transport helicopter in the world because of how fast it can go and how much it can lift
2031758 it is the only helicopter that can do all of this in heat or cold at high altitude
2031759 just for working in the arctic this helicopter is going to make a huge difference for canada
2031760 the range and fuel capacity means we can go places where we have not gone and with a speed and flexibility we dont have now
2031761 having tactical helicopters in afghanistan is essential and we have not been part of it
2031762 when i moved here there wasnt much here for someone who was more used to londons pace of life

2031768 we walked away shocked as the police escorted us out
2031769 they do it consistently they do it uniformly and they do it without regard to race
2031770 two other men of a different race were also asked to give up their seat one being a white individual and the other being an indian individual
2031771 but there were seats available at the bar as well as white men seated at the bar and when asked about those seats they said dont worry about those seats we want yours and youve got to go

2031788 at a minimum well be going back and touching base with them were not just handing them keys to a shiny new car were showing them how well they can use it
2031789 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way
2031790 people who farm now are not doing this for laughs despite the fact hollywood still thinks that theyre doing it to make a lot of money
2031791 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way theyre taking money back to those who kill prosecutors judges and law enforcement
2031792 they come into our own national parks and risk the lives of sheriffs and others
2031793 theyre using family or very trusted family friends they dont just use anybody

2031795 the people that are growing this are good at what they do
2031796 the goal is not just to eradicate the plants but to go after the organizations
2031797 in the past all weve been able to do is what we call whack and stack
2031798 were not just pulling the plants were targeting mid level and upper management of these trafficking organizations
2031799 often times we have people who will lead us to these gardens
2031800 i want to state that the guys growing the marijuana are not the guys i went to college with
2031801 its something thats troubling for many of us in law enforcement
2031802 you have illegal criminal activity in the mountain regions not only destroying the natural beauty of the landscape but as well as the potential for this product to reach the children of this community

2031807 harry truman and civil rights moral courage and political risks
2031808 i am going to try to remedy it and if that ends up in my failure to be reelected that failure will be in a good cause
2031809 he always used to mention eight words from thomas jefferson equal rights for all special privileges for none
2031810 and then he went on to say polls are just a snapshot of the moment it takes courage it takes honesty it takes forthrightness for people in positions of leadership and thats harry trumans moral compass and his moral compass showed up in those two fantastic executive orders
2031811 expanded opportunity for local businesses and for local people to have good jobs

2031822 cannot comprehend how many jewish people can speak of the holocaust as well as stating that israel is the holy land and commit the atrocities they are committing against the palestinian people
2031823 shed ourselves from the racist zionists in america they control everything but they wont keep us down any longer throw the jews in the oven this november its the only way we can free america and make sure barack obama is elected
2031824 israel has destroyed its own image in the world and is taking america down with its zionist aggression
2031825 the decision was based on going back to our roots a little bit
2031826 but i think people still need to be exposed to the true element

2031845 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
2031846 until this week polls showed mr obama with a slight lead over mr mccain some daily tracking polls this week showed the race tightening however leading some democrats to wonder why mr obama has not commanded a bigger lead in an election year in which republicans are disadvantaged by the unpopularity of president george w bush

2031882 radiation on the other hand is much more sinister and depending on the intensity and type it could be deadly
2031883 if you look overall at the detriments to human health then beyond doubt coal burning power stations pose a much greater threat
2031884 add to this all the people that have respiratory diseases as a result of working in the mines and arthur scargill is well aware of this since he campaigned for compensation for those affected and coal burning is almost certainly more damaging to health than nuclear power production

2031889 democrats could probably have defeated republican john mccain with a flawed but seasoned candidate like hillary clinton
2031890 dismissed suggestions that the nominating convention could be marred by tensions between his supporters and the die hard backers of hillary rodham clinton
2031891 it is a truth universally acknowledged that barack obama must continue to grovel to some of whom mutter darkly that they will not only not vote for him they will never vote for a man again

2031904 peter won that game and there was a wager made some money exchanged hands and wayne gretzky eddie mio and peter driscoll ended up in uniforms
2031905 yes they were part of the stakes of this backgammon game there were some trades mentioned actually we had our choice on the third player between peter driscoll and blaine stoughton and we took peter driscoll
2031906 it was a cornerstone for edmonton to build on later that year 1979 after the nhl expansion to edmonton hartford quebec and winnipeg the four wha cities we took mark messier who had been in cincinnati in the wha in the nhl draft it really gave edmonton a nucleus to go on and be very competitive in the national hockey league
2031907 i saw it in progress and i knew the stakes were very high and i was cheering like heck for peter
2031908 i think there was some art involved from peters side and from nelsons side it happened to be hockey players it was kind of a strange transaction in the world of sports i didnt care if peter lost and lost his artwork i was more interested that he won and get some hockey players to build our foundation with yes he kept his artwork ended up with some hockey players and paid out some cash in the transaction
2031909 scouts obviously felt he could be a tremendous player i dont know if anyone in their right mind at that time thought he could be the dominating force he has been to the game of hockey in the long run especially wayne ended up in los angeles it was good for the game of hockey
2031910 he said the documents shown to him were prepared in line with information acquired by intelligence units on terrorist organization pkk dhkp c t kko turkish workers peasants liberation party nak ibendi and other similar groups of organizations and were part of his tasks during his office at the special forces additionally he said the documents shown to him were reports prepared by units under his official assignment and was one of their routine tasks

2031916 we have some younger kids we think are going to be future players for us and we want to get them involved and see how they do in the camp
2031917 it allows more players to have the experience and really gives us the opportunity to look at a wider variety of players there are a lot of players that we may not have a lot of information on that we would like to see at that level
2031918 its always intriguing to see how younger players play here when they are quote unquote playing up
2031919 what we have found is that most players if you put them in a setting and give them an opportunity they are going to excel now this is pretty stiff competition and so many capable players but certainly these guys are all deserving of being here
2031920 you have to go as hard as you can every shift it was an incredible experience and definitely something i will learn from

2031937 thats where the bait cars are very effective going after that kind of thief

2031979 the theory is that no matter what the price of oil does over the next several months these companies will have a difficult time making money if oil moves higher consumers will have no choice but to work harder at conserving and utilizing alternative transportation sources the auto industry what is left of it will need to manufacture more efficient cars mostly due to consumer demand which will also eventually curb demand the recent parabolic run up in oil prices seems to have caused enough outrage to finally get the auto industry to notice that it is time for a change therefore reduced oil demand will be just one of the reasons why these companies could see profit erosion
2031980 would get crushed in a bear market rally which might very well occur around the olympics bear market rallies can be quite powerful but ultimately chinas mother of all bubbles will unravel more driving the shanghai index to new lows

2031992 the argument that government prevention efforts are not tailored to the black epidemic is mistaken

2032016 we cant let them get away with this underhanded move to undermine womens health and thats why i am sounding the alarm
2032017 i find it astonishing that the federal government could regulate health care and reproductive choices based on a popularity contest

2032034 for me this is just a murder for my economic future
2032035 its the uncertainty in the financial markets that is propelling gold upwards
2032036 the rural poor account for two thirds of annual gold purchases small scale farmers have traditionally used spare cash to invest in small pieces of gold jewelry because in the face of economic and political uncertainty they favor gold above paper assets

2032063 it encourages if not creates lawsuits our countrys courts are clogged with unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits which delay if not obstruct the access to courts of people that really need to get there that have serious legal grievances
2032064 it seems kind of like an accident almost like the big bang that created the universe was an accident

2032067 as soon as someone mentions faith in an argument the argument is over
2032068 faith and the scientific method cant be combined in the same argument
2032069 how can i just look up and talk to god if i dont know that this person is up there listening to me how can i pray how can i believe in him

2032072 as an educator i like to teach critical thinking at a deep and erudite level because its not embedded in the curriculum as much as id like to see
2032073 and this provides a place for kids to talk about deep questions that many into adulthood dont even consider and contemplate

2032077 i see all but two or three hands raised when youve come out as a skeptic have people just flipped out hearing that you dont believe what everyone else believes
2032078 i just dont have beliefs but i tell my family that and they think im the devil because i dont believe in god
2032079 and she got really mad at me and said oh my god dont take the lords name in vain and i thought about it for a minute and i said but hes not my lord
2032080 but if i get proof that there is no god and christianity is a wild goose chase then i would completely abandon it
2032081 if god really really wanted us to know he existed hed make daily appearances like its 3 15

2032086 during many ages there were witches the bible said so the bible commanded that they should not be allowed to live therefore the church after doing its duty in but a lazy and indolent way for 800 years gathered up its halters thumbscrews and firebrands and set about its holy work in earnest she worked hard at it night and day during nine centuries and imprisoned tortured hanged and burned whole hordes and armies of witches and washed the christian world clean with their foul blood then it was discovered that there was no such thing as witches and never had been one does not know whether to laugh or to cry
2032087 when i think of all the harm the bible has done i despair of ever writing anything to equal it

2032124 i now feel comfortable playing in the big events where as before i had a bit of a problem
2032125 this year my swing is better and i feel more content with life in general
2032126 when i do something like that i just try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like it it helped that i hit a great two putt on number two
2032127 now on the first tee i am sort of my own boss a lot more than ive ever been
2032128 before i tried to force results and tried to make things happen instead of just going out there and playing
2032129 i tried to play too difficult for a while and just saw big rough and i couldnt play
2032130 the shots can only come when i am standing on the first tee and not too afraid to go out and meet a very tough golf course
2032131 we have already spoken about starting a large family and marriage and will do so soon when the time is right for both of us
2032132 i had never really split up with sarah everything you read was so silly sarah and i love each other

2032135 firebug seems to have defined the universe for this lot
2032136 you are a union that is proud of achieving a muslim holiday and prayer room
2032137 the history of the labor movement tells us that unions are at their strongest when theyre most inclusive
2032138 that means making it our business to stand up to win respect for every workers right to practice their faith
2032139 most of the somali workers are probably muslim but some of them could be christian too we just dont know
2032140 the contract was then overwhelmingly agreed to by 80 percent of the rank and file membership of the union at the shelbyville plant
2032141 mam im sorry but youve got a disorder of your ravelymps were going to have to start you on some ravelympics
2032142 when used as a burial marker the cross does not signify death in the abstract
2032143 for the government to claim that the cross is a secular symbol is deeply offensive and betrays a poor understanding of religion and our constitution
2032144 we made this sacrifice along with him and we get to have this symbol of what happened
2032145 how lord are you going to be glorified through this other than just teaching me patience and more about your faithfulness protection
2032146 it is a program that ties together our roots in extension with msu andy lewis from wisconsin first developed the idea and it is now being done in states like oh ks wv and others

2032148 what are the first impressions of people who come into your town as visitors what do they see when they enter town are there signs of vibrancy and health or of decay and neglect are the residential areas that are most evident to outsiders kept clean and well tended what type of image comes from the business district he industrial parks and the main thoroughfare through your town think of driving through other small communities you get a certain sense of each community as you drive through dont you the towns storefronts and streets its parks and houses the landscaping and the land itself all murmur a subtle message about the type of town it is this message is magnified by personal encounters with residents in restaurants stores the chamber of commerce office or wherever you meet its people
2032149 recently in the soho store they dedicated one wall of the mens department to black and white
2032150 one thing ive said now for several years is if a company is telling you about the letter i would ask to see the letter because thats the only way to know what the fda said
2032151 i never understood the rationale of complaining that something became licensed in your region because that means it becomes more easily accessible
2032152 kevin white was the first thing the fbi wanted to talk to him about
2032153 they told me they had an investigation going on down there
2032154 i said now anything we need to get rezoned youll vote our way right
2032155 cox recounted in one of his letters to the st
2032156 as a navy veteran and a former police officer ive made my life and career by serving others mr cox has made his life out of lying cheating and stealing so the public can determine whos lying here
2032157 cox would give 500 cash to his business associates and ask them to write a check to white arnold said
2032158 white was interested in redevelopment in tampa heights and so were the guys at urban equity they had the same interests
2032159 the way it works is ill get enough votes to pass your rezoning because when issues like this come up for vote most of the members vote with the elected council member of the district and ill be the ybor elected council member if the other members dont support my votes in my district then i dont support their votes in their district
2032160 what he said was by giving him that kind of money we would have his unwavering support on anything we put before the city council
2032161 it was very very clear we give you the money and you get us the votes
2032162 i told the fbi all i know about white and at the time the agents seemed very excited
2032163 but then they called my lawyer and told her it wasnt enough to prosecute
2032164 i guess we should have videotaped it well next time i bribe an elected official im videoing the whole thing

2032183 brothers if anyone is caught in any transgression you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness keep watch on yourself lest you be tempted
2032184 6 i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel 7 not that there is another one but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of christ 8 but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you let him be accursed 9 as we have said before so now i say again if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received let him be accursed

2032201 it is clear that iran does not pay attention to talks
2032202 and this is a clear message to the international community to continue with real and effective sanctions and clearly iran is a threat not only to israel this is a global threat and the international community should act accordingly
2032203 i think that time is of the essence intensive sanctions can be effective iran is a threat to its neighbors as well
2032204 and the international community is being watched not only by iran but also by its neighbors and when the international community shows hesitation this is being perceived as weakness and we live in a neighborhood where either you beat the bully or join it

2032208 it should come as no surprise that pricing opportunities are surfacing and the discount between market value and intrinsic value is growing in the bulk of our portfolio our portfolio in our view has rarely been cheaper than it is today
2032209 in some instances the valuations seem somewhat anomalistic for example over the last several months we have established a position in swiss re the world s largest reinsurance company the company at initial purchase was trading at 5 times earnings 77 of book value 70 of imbedded value and a 6 dividend yield earlier this year warren buffett purchased a 3 position in the company and has agreed to take on 20 of swiss re s property amp casualty business over the next 5 years freeing up reserves for a stock buyback we have also been buying telecinco spain s largest television production company at initial purchase it was trading at 4 times pretax income ebit and had a 17 dividend yield with net cash on its balance sheet another deeply undervalued current holding is medikit a japanese medical device company which is currently trading at 1 6 times pre tax income ebit and has a 2 5 dividend yield once again with net cash on the balance sheet while all of our stocks are not trading at these extreme valuations they are indicative of some of the incredible bargains we are seeing in equity markets unfortunately great opportunity is invariably accompanied by bad macroeconomics and near term uncertainty if the picture were clear the pricing opportunity would not exist in times like this investors must try to steel their nerves and ignore the ever present market pundits who predict stock market collapses at the end of an era these voices seem to always drown out more reasoned thought in times such as the present

2032213 if senator mccain wants to talk about how washington is broken thats a debate im happy to have because senator mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists

2032218 richard f syron in 2004 received a memo from freddie macs chief risk officer warning him that the firm was financing questionable loans that threatened its financial health
2032219 today freddie mac and the nations other major mortgage finance company fannie mae are in such perilous condition that the federal government has readied a taxpayer financed bailout that could cost billions
2032220 in an interview freddie macs former chief risk officer david a andrukonis recalled telling mr syron in mid 2004 that the company was buying bad loans that would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
2032221 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a little bit he said but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
2032222 those and other choices initially paid off for mr syron who has collected more than 38 million in compensation since 2003
2032223 now some outsiders are saying that mr syron and the top executive at fannie mae some of the highest profile figures in the business world should be replaced

2032247 each of the events resulted in an average of three to 10 pre orders for the mks and generated a lot of momentum around the vehicle

2032250 educated people understand the technology in the mks and theyre excited about all of the things this vehicle can do
2032251 they love that they can get real time weather and sports scores and even gas prices using sirius travel link

2032299 i was comparing actually the numbers from the ninth district race this year from previous races over the decade i think this was the lowest turnout in any of the primaries since 1998 theres just not as much energy out there as there has been in previous elections

2032304 dumping the 25 emissions based congestion charge scrapping probably the biggest purchase order for zero emission vehicles in the world and abandoning the 50 affordable housing target are all evidence of a major backtrack
2032305 boris is adopting or considering a number of policies that are likely to increase londons carbon footprint these include endorsing a 50 increase in flights from london city airport and considering a new airport in the thames estuary
2032306 in addition he has supported an extra river crossing downstream from tower bridge to ease traffic congestion which could lead to a rise in the number of vehicles on londons roads if this was a road crossing
2032307 despite recognising that climate change is one of the biggest threats facing london boris has failed to secure the team he needs to deliver on his promise to cut carbon emissions by 60 by 2025 this can only add to fears that he will seek to cut spending on climate change projects
2032308 by not appointing environmental experts johnson is missing the chance to build on the good work already being done in london there must now be very real concerns as to whether boris has any plan or strategy to maintain london as a world leading sustainable city

2032310 the real challenge facing london is how to get the capacity to invest and deliver on the huge multibillion pound projects from crossrail and the olympics to the rail extensions and tube upgrades which this city needs to continue to grow and prosper

2032312 i appreciate the public demand to watch concerts in the big theater we plan to complete its restoration within two or three months but to do so we need cooperation between austrian and turkish authorities restoration of the ancient open air theater in ephesus is a genuinely big task both for archeologists and the restoration experts we need to strengthen the theater so that we do not have any problems in holding music concerts there i know that not only turks but also foreign tourists who visit ephesus want concerts to be held in ephesus i hope this will happen as soon as possible
2032313 we now have so many new facts related to the ephesus of prehistoric times thanks to relics we have uncovered in ukuri ih y k
2032314 archeologists need time excavating alone is the easiest part of their job but restoration of unearthed remnants takes quite a lot time the culture and tourism ministry wants to have the uncovered remnants restored in a professional way
2032315 if restoration of them cannot be fully achieved then theyd better remain under the soil

2032337 the publication of how terrorist groups end a thorough new report by rand a think tank with historic ties to the u s military vindicates critics of the global war on terror who have argued that a law enforcement approach to fighting al qaeda rather than a military war with all the bluntness that wars entail would have been better for protecting americans the report concluded that the administrations war on terrorism has not significantly degraded al qaeda and that the group has morphed into a more formidable enemy writes ivan eland senior fellow at the independent institute and director of the center on peace amp liberty

2032366 we had someone tell us that they were coming to new york just for our annual noir festival
2032367 i wasnt aware we had one we didnt plan it but this is like a sequel to our new york noir series more of a paris noir
2032368 melville was a great director but never recognized here in his lifetime
2032369 weve been behind him for the past 10 years and it seems like hes finally getting the reputation he deserves

2032371 the french discovered the same thing the americans did about noir
2032372 its a good way to make a movie inexpensively they were great inexpensive showcases for directors and writers its like godard said all you need is a girl and a gun
2032373 i have the idea of a nexus with dali at the center with arrows going 2 ways
2032374 these were films that either drew from dali or that dali might have drawn from there are so many ways in which we see dalis influence throughout the past 70 years of cinema it really gave me an opportunity to be creative to go beyond the obvious associations
2032375 with its direct visual references both to dali and the work of dalis idol
2032376 its a great program but the other venues didnt have quite the same focus on film exhibition that we have we are a particularly film oriented institution
2032377 the full encyclopedic film component of this exhibition is key to us and is unique to moma
2032378 by the end of this exhibition we hope that audiences will have a truly expansive knowledge about who dali was where his ideas originated and what his legacy has been
2032379 if as some kind of gesture we said no to new coal fired power stations we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this technology ourselves it requires some new coal powered fire stations for the technology to develop
2032380 world demand for coal is projected to rise by 70 by 2030 an average annual rate of 2 2 and the bulk of the rise will come from india and china
2032381 china is a nation built on coal so the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
2032382 we are responsible for 2 of emissions worldwide and we have a duty to tackle that
2032383 but the real gain here the real challenge and if we do not meet the challenge all is lost on global warming the stakes are that high is to bring on clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage
2032384 once we can develop those technologies we can help the chinese the indians and others to retrofit power stations and make ccs a component of new coal fired power stations that is the only way we are going to tackle this problem
2032385 if we were to have a moratorium on coal fired stations we would therefore most likely become more dependent on gas
2032386 i dont want to exaggerate but gas comes from some fairly unstable parts of the world and some not readily associated with human rights and democracy
2032387 i think if we did that at the moment when we do not know 100 that ccs is going to work the engineering has not yet been tested and no one is fully aware of what the costs might be then that would put an end to coal fired power stations and demonstration plant and people would build gas again

2032405 when you clean up very polluted air as china is doing during these olympics it has a direct impact on global warming and temperatures rise
2032406 and of course im not saying lets burn more coal im just saying that we need to start thinking of clever ways to address both problems we know that air pollution masks the effects of global warming but to what percentage we are still not certain thats one of the things my experiment will be looking at if its 80 percent that would be bad news
2032407 im not a policymaker and theres no magic bullet but we have to be aware of both the climate change aspect and the pollution aspect china has done a good thing by cleaning up the air for these games but they are all at the mercy of the winds beijing remains a very polluted city

2032423 the new face of apprenticeships is often very different to the traditional model and these changes need to be reflected in the pay and protections available to all apprentices
2032424 a strong counter argument would be that decent minimum pay rates make it more likely that apprentices will complete their training
2032425 this in turn will have a positive impact on the reputation of the brand and encourage more employers to participate
2032426 apprenticeships are very different today from the traditional model with many trainees finishing their programme within a year
2032427 this development must be reflected in their pay and conditions
2032428 ten years on from the minimum wage becoming law millions of low paid workers have benefited from better pay and protection from exploitation its now time for apprentices to benefit from these rights too

2032444 if we paid what they were asking everything would have cost 85 instead we paid 16 one guy fell on the ground and said youre killing me boss lady my wife said i dont want to kill you im just not paying that price it was great
2032445 when the new economic policy began to show some results in the early eighties the western press and local opponents of the government began to talk about cronyism whoever succeeded in a developing country like malaysia did so because they were the chosen favourites of the government particularly the head of the government
2032446 while most bumiputeras who were given shares and opportunities to do business abused these opportunities a few tried seriously and some of them succeeded obviously these would be the people who should get more opportunities those who had abused their rights were also given second and third chances but as they continued to mess up their contracts and projects they were dropped out giving them more opportunities would simply be a waste it would not help correct the economic imbalances
2032447 admittedly some of them failed and were dropped the numbers who succeeded became smaller as we cannot risk giving to failures the few successful people seem to be getting all the government contracts privatisation projects and other business opportunities

2032452 history should have taught us that when we hear a leader of a state make statements so extreme as to seem almost unbelievable we should take that seriously

2032497 freddie along with fannie is a dominant provider of funding to the u s housing market together they own or guarantee about 5 trillion of mortgages or nearly half of all u s home mortgage debt outstanding
2032498 one of the two ways freddie and fannie make money is by holding on to a heap of mortgages and securities made up of bundles of home loans that they buy from lenders
2032499 in addition they earn money from guaranty fees charged to insure mortgage payments bundles of these guaranteed loans are then packaged into securities to be sold to investors in the asset backed market
2032500 the mortgage related investments that freddie stores on its books fall in its so called retained portfolio and the company earns income from the interest and principal payments from the underlying loans held piszel freddies chief financial officer said wednesday that the company intends to slow the growth in its 791 8 billion retained portfolio of mortgage related securities in an effort to shore up capital
2032501 more than half of this portfolio or 413 9 billion is made up of securities of mortgage loans guaranteed by freddie by buying securities whose loans it guarantees the company provides support in the marketplace for these investments encouraging others to buy them in addition this also kept borrowing costs for homeowners low as there was steady buying support for mortgages piszel said the company will pause growing its portfolio but will continue to buy mortgage securities from capital freed up from the possible sale of securities from within this portfolio and the repayment of principal on the underlying home loans
2032502 fannie mae the largest u s mortgage finance company sliced its dividend after posting its fourth straight quarterly loss and cut its dividend as record delinquencies pushed up credit costs
2032503 we are focused here very much on doing whats right for our shareholders and to steer the business through a difficult time
2032504 we have steered it through good times and we are going to steer it through these times
2032505 maybe the chairman sir tom mckillop probably will be the one that will have to fall on his sword and simply because the ceo sir fred goodwin removing him would be too disruptive to the organisation at this time and its just not responsible to do so
2032506 so if the investors want someones head they will probably go after the chairmans
2032507 we are acutely aware that we drew heavily on our shareholders for financial support and we recognise that we must now deliver a level of performance that meets their expectations for the company and restores value to our shares we are determined to do so and this is our focus

2032510 in drawing the interim reporting season to a close rbs is the first of the largest uk banks to go into the red
2032511 another set of contrite comments from a uk bank chief executive does little to mitigate the fact that the business remains under pressure
2032512 with bad debts jumping nearly 60 and a continuously worsening economic environment the nearer term prospects seem little better
2032513 the clock is still ticking for the management team who need to repair some of the damage which has hit rbs financially and reputationally poor rbs
2032514 serious scholars even if theyre not believers even if they do not think this is a sacred text still consider it to be history because things match up so well
2032515 t here isnt anything to contradict or anything to make me wary of the testimony of scripture
2032516 the historical material in the old testament must be taken with great seriousness it is primary evidence for the history of the time and no honest historian or archaeologist should treat it as anything else
2032517 on the whole archaeological work has unquestionably strengthened confidence in the reliability of the scriptural record more than one archaeologist has found his respect for the bible increased by experience of excavation of palestine
2032518 while many have doubted the accuracy of the bible time and continued research have consistently demonstrated that the word of god is better informed than its critics
2032519 not one unquestionable find of archaeology that proves the bible to be in error at any point
2032520 numerous discoveries have confirmed the historical accuracy of the biblical documents even down to the occasional use of obsolete names of foreign kings
2032521 any errors in the field of history would undermine the confidence of the reader in the theological trustworthiness of scripture
2032522 it must be included in rather than excluded from the pool of reliable data for a reconstruction of the origin and history of ancient israel

2032536 if the guardian report is true it marks a third shift in lib dem thinking in recent months alongside the commitment to cut the overall tax burden for the low paid and middle classes and the likely reforms of the partys commitment to oppose tuition fees
2032537 the new thinking on tuition fees is that it actually has become a vote loser as graduates now look back and think i had to pay why shouldnt they i think
2032538 i really thought the theme of this posting was lib dems change of stance on lit not tuition fees
2032539 yes we would but its not one of our main priorities
2032540 we may be a campaign with many thousands of members from all age groups from all across the country but we all want the same thing fairer funding for local government in other words council tax reform
2032541 it is basically daft to collect income tax centrally and pass the money to local authorities in a general grant the whole general grant can and should be replaced by a local income tax
2032542 the recent announcement of policy that we have not had the chance to debate at conference is that we will also reduce the overall tax burden and specifically the treasurery team will find 20billion worth of cuts that hitherto it has not identified and did not spot at the last general election

2032556 please re think posting material like this we are not interested in an anti israel policy
2032557 the last thing we need is to be aligned with more anti semitic rhetoric jewish conspiracy speculation should be left to the experts at the united nations

2032562 the scriptures say you must worship the lord your god and serve only him
2032563 the scriptures also say you must not test the lord your god
2032564 though he was god he did not think of equality with god as something to cling to instead he gave up his divine privileges he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being
2032565 for god made christ who never sinned to be the offering for our sin so that we could be made right with god through christ
2032566 for he faced all of the same testings we do yet he did not sin
2032567 but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses telling people about me everywhere in jerusalem throughout judea in samaria and to the ends of the earth
2032568 humble yourself you only think you know what you should do let me fill you with my mighty power because you are not strong enough on your own work for my honor not other peoples opinions trust me to handle the worries and concerns dont you realize how much i care about you watch out satan wants to devour your time and your soul stand with me against the temptation to do what you or others think will be good i will call you to your ministries and your strength and guidance will come from trusting me stand firm in your faith and i will fight the roaring lion for you
2032569 it is not a lack of spiritual experience that leads to failure but a lack of working to keep our eyes focused and on the right goal

2032580 the jews suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the byzantines in ad 70
2032581 these are good muslims because they appear to live by some christian vlaues peace tolerance and these guys are bad muslims because they follow the koran
2032582 this pope jovan vranishkovski is under serbian and greek influence he is paid by the serbs because he is preaching at his church in serbian the macedonian church is not recognized by the serbs or the greeks the macedonian orthodox church is against preaching in serbian in macedonian territory
2032583 are the greeks and the serbs working together on this
2032584 because the serbian church is supporting the greek church against recognizing the macedonian church as independent the greek church can recognize the macedonian church as independent but not under this name they are not recognizing the name of the state and they are not recognizing the language plus they are not recognizing the church the muslim community is supporting the orthodox church against this pope and saying you should be independent and this pope should have his own church in macedonia the muslim community is supporting the orthodox church so the orthodox church is supporting the muslim community against us and the macedonian government is under the influence of the orthodox church plus this political party the national political party they are investing a lot of money in the church building process mosques also etc so you see this government is sacrificing bektashism because of the problem of the orthodox church with the pope
2032585 the balkans wouldnt be the balkans without this kind of convoluted political intrigue it really is like the middle east
2032586 ive been struggling with this a lot lately too and right now i have decided to avoid anything i think will stay with me and haunt me but its just a temporary solution since i dont like the idea of ignoring the negatives in the world if we dont know about these things then how will things ever change and thats i think why awful things like those you described are so haunting they are things that should not happen and once you know they are happening you want to do something to make it stop and when you cant its hard to detach from it and just forget about it

2032604 we have every intention of working with the industry to provide not only revenue streams that are vast but also an answer for the publishers in general our method will increase current revenue halt and reverse advertising revenue lost to the internet and overcome the lack of the ability for magazines to stay current
2032605 if our goal were to be pirates we could have made live a number of features including but not limited to downloading and printing allowable to visitors and members alike
2032606 to compare us to other similar sites with the only difference with of us being free is to disregard the importance of the mygazines custom magazine for users notifications and our full ability to share on the go across the globe instantly
2032607 we have ways of drawing revenue from a number of sources some more obvious than others mygazines is hardly a pirate website with the interest of breaking the industry rather we offer a paradigm shift that is far more fiscally comprehensive than meets the eye and yet easily transitionable by even the biggest publishers
2032608 we can certainly continue to make our case and meet in the courts if need be that seems to be the intention of the publishers as a whole but ask yourself to what end even if they are triumphant in this battle they will lose the war
2032609 he suggested that with publishers cooperation everybody could make some money

2032621 its getting increasingly evident that this is a once in a century type of phenomenon
2032622 not the standard type of liquidity crisis that we have seen in the past
2032623 its still very evident from inter bank lending spreads that we have not gotten closure yet
2032624 its essentially fundamentally the price of homes in the united states which are determining the ultimate collateral of mortgage backed bonds pretty much around the world
2032625 were still nowhere near the bottom of the home price thing
2032626 ultra expansionary us monetary policies with artificially low interest rates led to bubbles all over the world and in every imaginable asset class the price of gold more than doubled in nominal terms and against the dow jones industrial average
2032627 central banks of necessity determine what the money supply is
2032628 if you are on a gold standard or other mechanism in which the central banks do not have discretion then the system works automatically
2032629 the reason there is now very little support for the gold standard is the consequences of those types of market adjustments are not considered to be appropriate in the 20th and 21st century i am one of the rare people who have still some nostalgic view about the old gold standard as you know but i must tell you i am in a very small minority among my colleagues on that issue

2032636 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
2032637 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian

2032641 a political advisor to harold washington during washingtons second mayoral race and who is now chief political and media advisor to illinois senator and presidential candidate barack obama
2032642 i think it would be premature to jump out there and say exactly what may have happened
2032643 we know one contributing factor would be that it appears that a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout and that certainly contributed to the accident
2032644 the future relationship between materials and technologies in product fundamentalism vol 2
2032645 i think it also sent a very clear message to them by saying that hes inclined to order monetary sanctions against the county that this kind of behavior the stalling the production of important information about children hiding things about this system will not be tolerated by the court
2032646 the decision was taken on the basis of the fact that he was a sweden democrat which he had not said anything about it was later argued that there were other reasons but none of them were sufficient to warrant terminating his employment
2032647 if we get rid of employees with uncomfortable opinions it becomes very uncertain as to who will be allowed to stay this is not up to an individual manager to decide freedom of expression is very much fundamental to our democracy and administration
2032648 there has been some criticism in the media of the premier league with a call for quotas to guarantee english players starting places in teams
2032649 i did not start the final of the uefa champions league with six englishmen because i was making a political statement i did it because theyre good enough to win the european cup
2032650 it is nonsense to say that england does not have players capable of competing on the international stage
2032651 the hysteria surrounding englands non qualification for euro 2008 does not create the right atmosphere for good decision making
2032652 its vital that the game takes a step back and concentrates on making the right choices
2032653 we have the strongest and the most entertaining league in the world we should celebrate that not denigrate it
2032654 last season proved once again that as well as being the hardest league in the world to win the premier league is also the best
2032655 if someone tell you an obviously untrue story on the continent you would remark
2032656 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small

2032658 if something doesnt happen to correct itself soon its going to raise some red flags for us
2032659 i dont know why we havent dropped to less than 4 a gallon we should get there soon when i saw that seattle dropped below 4 i thought for sure wed be right on their coattails but boy the market was slow to react and i start to raise my eyebrows
2032660 it seems to happen every time prices start falling elsewhere alaskas doesnt fall its not surprising but that doesnt make it right
2032661 the funny thing is alaska prices are pretty reactive on the way up but slower on the way down
2032662 my guess is that demand up here has not fallen as precipitously as in the lower 48 and therefore retailers are not feeling as compelled to drop prices as quickly thats capitalism
2032663 we get complaints all the time we tell them its a fair market and people charge what they think the market can bear if were getting most of our gas from in state refineries youve gotta look at our salaries which are generally higher but really i have no idea theres no good answer other than its what the market bears
2032664 a lot of time distributors will say it must be the tax alaskas tax is the lowest in the nation and theres no tax at all on home heating fuel
2032665 my chief economist tells me its because small markets generally respond to price changes slower and alaska is a tiny tiny market when it comes to motor fuels
2032666 people dont understand that its a free market its not a regulated industry it can only be explained by market forces
2032667 im not sure why the retail numbers in alaska are so much above the lower 48 range while u s demand is down on a nationwide basis it may be that some of the energy active states have stronger demand this is the case in texas albeit to a small degree
2032668 im not familiar with any particular global or local problem that has kept alaska prices so high needless to say its a market that doesnt have many of the high volume chains that operate in the lower 48
2032669 people say wait a minute it only costs this much to get oil this much to refine it this much to get it to the station so how come were paying so much more
2032670 theres a fundamental misperception that retailers should only sell for what it cost them and a little bit more no law says they have to do that you have to rely on the market to do that
2032671 i am just real pleased with the relief weve provided
2032672 this is a big deal this is a big night for alaskans
2032673 we did a good job of addressing rural alaskas needs
2032674 suspending the 8 cent fuel tax will help people who drive a lot in the urban areas
2032675 we understand the concerns but believe the development is in the best interests of the local area securing jobs creating employment and also cutting traffic
2032676 we want to remain at shaw we dont want to leave but we have to keep growing in the future we may have to move elsewhere theres no planning law that would preclude us the plan has been opposed on emotional grounds
2032677 the n brown jd williams project is a significant investment into the region safeguarding over 1 000 jobs and investing 23m into the local economy
2032678 the 109th congress is so bad that it makes you wonder if democracy is a failed experiment
2032679 i think that if the framers went to capitol hill today it would shake their confidence in the system they created congress has become an exercise of raw power with no principles and in that environment corruption has flourished the republicans in congress decided from the outset that their future would be inextricably tied to george bush and his policies it has become this sad session of members sitting down and drinking kool aid delivered by karl rove congress became a mere extension of the white house
2032680 i remember one incident very clearly i think it was 2001
2032681 i was working for new mexico republican pete domenici at the time we were in a budget committee hearing and the democrats were debating what the final result would be and my boss gets up and he says why are you saying this youre not even going to be in the room when the decisions are made just said it right out in the open
2032682 naturally he scheduled it for something like 9 a m on a friday when congress wasnt in session hoping that no one would show
2032683 take a picture wait five minutes gavel it out all for show
2032684 more often than not were trying to figure out where the conference is
2032685 we havent seen any congressional investigations like this during the last six years
2032686 these days congress doesnt seem to be capable of doing this sort of thing too much nasty partisanship
2032687 it means no discussion no amendments that is profoundly undemocratic
2032688 we are going to have seventy percent open and unrestricted rules
2032689 negotiations are open put on the table the things that your district and people need and well get them
2032690 they have developed rules that are an abuse of majority power keeping votes open by freezing the clock barring minority senators from negotiations on important conference issues it is a record that the republicans should now dread one of the concerns that republicans have about losing congress is that they will have to live under the practices and rules they have created the abuses that served them in the majority could come back to haunt them in the minority
2032691 and following an hour of debate we get rid of it
2032692 there are only four days left in the fiscal year the 2007 defense appropriations conference report must be signed into law by the president before saturday at midnight
2032693 the whole point of passing appropriations bills is that congress is supposed to make small increases in programs to account for things like the increase in population
2032694 this congress spent a week and a half debating terri schiavo it never made appropriations a priority
2032695 it was the most egregious thing imaginable it was just lucky we caught them
2032696 fulbright behaved the same way with nixon as he did with johnson
2032697 oversight is one of the most important functions of congress perhaps more important than legislating
2032698 and the republicans have completely failed at it i think they decided that they were going to be good republicans first and good legislators second
2032699 i think it would be a monumental waste of time to re plow this ground any further
2032700 you talk to many republicans in congress privately and they will tell you how appalled they are by the administrations diminishment of civil liberties and the constant effort to keep fear alive
2032701 yet those same members slavishly vote with the white house whats most alarming about the 109th has been the massive erosion of authority in congress there has always been partisanship but this is different members have become robotic in the way they vote
2032702 i think your response reflects that we have given a good deal of consideration
2032703 that we have clear plans in place and are ready to proceed
2032704 what theyve all figured out is that theres no political payoff in oversight
2032705 they have made this request in lieu of contributions made to their own campaigns
2032706 cannot currently provide adequate evidence supporting various material amounts on the financial statements
2032707 and nobody did anything about it thats the job of congress but they dont care anymore
2032708 each time you print it hurts my family and now i have lost them along with everything i have worked for during my 64 years of life

2032712 a dependence on alcohol has been a problem for me
2032713 less than it usually does during a typical two year period
2032714 we cannot be a party that strips working americans of the right to a secret ballot election
2032715 professors who vote know candidates for 10 or 20 years
2032716 even if there is an interference with the university decision reasons must be adequately laid out
2032717 when you look at the last four years of gazi university you can see dramatic changes gazi university was in the media with violence among students now nobody hears of such events
2032718 i filed another lawsuit for an order of stay of execution
2032719 decision makers do not change the problematic structure of y k and every decision and nomination is causing trouble turkey needs restructuring in higher education

2032722 well kids seems the universe has called my bluff and its time to put my money where my mouth is when it comes to microsoft
2032723 should children 13 be exposed to what the army does
2032724 in elementary school kids learn about the actions of the continental army that won our freedoms under george washington and the armys role in ending hitlers oppression today they need to know that the army is engaged around the world to defeat terrorist forces bent on the destruction of america and our freedoms
2032725 we have a teen rating that allows 13 year olds to play and in order to maintain that rating we have to adhere to certain standards we dont use blood and gore and violence to entertain thats not the purpose of our game we want to reach young people to show them what the army does and were obviously proud of that we cant reach them if we are over the top with violence and other aspects of war that might not be appropriate its a choice we made to be able to reach the audience we want

2032729 it is categorically not like floating you are plummeting you are going down as fast as the human body could go you drop about a mile before the parachute is opened
2032730 there are so many things that you see from the sky most of us are familiar with being up there from our flights to various holiday destinations so we know roughly speaking what the ground looks like from a jet
2032731 but here were in smaller planes or helicopters talking with experts who know exactly what they are looking at the effect is completely different
2032732 you see all the archaeological sites extraordinary field patterns iron age forts traces of original roman roads and so on which most people would look down on and not notice
2032733 this was such a simple idea but such an effective one it was vital to be looking down but the perspective is only interesting if you are with somebody who knows something special and can strip away the blandly familiar
2032734 why are our cities this shape why are our field systems like this how is it possible to get so many people in and out of cities every day and not tip into mayhem somehow by a blend of skill and alchemy everything on our crowded beautiful islands keeps working
2032735 what i hope people take away from this is a sense of how extraordinary it is that we all manage to get along without tipping into utter mayhem and chaos because there are so many of us on such a small historic space the miracle is not that we avoid some kind of national catastrophe its that we actually all get through 24 hours again and again without grinding into each other and the whole thing falling apart

2032739 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2032741 time is not right for an all out rewriting of the constitution
2032742 no matter how cumbersome and difficult there is no problem we cannot overcome within democracy it is our duty to give the people a vision we must get rid of unproductive disputes that suck turkeys energy and increase democratic standards in turkey with a modern constitution

2032745 the markets always find a new way to make a fool out of you
2032746 i enjoyed pitching with pedro but i watched pedro for a year come and go as he pleased and do whatever he pleased from a schedule standpoint and to a point all star break heading home and no one ever said a word the things that pedro said going out of town about terry francona that crushed me because of what i saw tito do for him
2032747 i called her name several times and she was snoring away
2032748 and when she found out about it and she decided that this was not something that should be done in the district court because it was antithetical to the very integrity of the court and she told you that you knew that you were going to have a problem and it was at that point that you decided to embark upon a scheme by which you were going to have her removed from the bench isnt that true
2032749 thats not true she never ever discussed it with me
2032750 i remembered some of what happened after i saw the tape
2032751 nick and i loved each other we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2032752 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great

2032767 you know its at times like this when im trapped in a vogon airlock with a man from betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that i really wish id listened to what my mother told me when i was young
2032768 a blossom is the final fleeting detail on a miraculous and arduous course of survival oriented events we call a flower
2032769 the first thing i want you to do is pray pray every way you know how for everyone you know
2032770 there are a lot of things you should do after youve prayed theres not a thing you can do until youve prayed
2032771 he wants not only us but everyone saved you know everyone to get to know the truth weve learned
2032772 theres one god and only one and one priest mediator between god and us jesus who offered himself in exchange for everyone held captive by sin to set them all free
2032773 eventually the news is going to get out this and this only has been my appointed work getting this news to those who have never heard of god and explaining how it works by simple faith and plain truth
2032774 since prayer is at the bottom of all this what i want mostly is for men to pray not shaking angry fists at enemies but raising holy hands to god
2032775 do i have the right priority am i really committed to and dependent on prayer
2032776 do i have the right perspective do i really believe people without christ are lost do i really believe that god wants everyone to hear the good news

2032781 im not afraid of the work i have 12 years of experience i am more afraid of the hospital jargon
2032782 if i knew how to solve the situation i would have done it already
2032783 we have to find solutions that would involve shortening the education for those nurses who already obtained one qualification and they could study and work while obtaining the second
2032784 the hospitals also carry their deal of responsibility and can participate in solving this problem by looking at for example nurses incomes and the atmosphere in the work place
2032785 it is difficult to become a nurse in britain they have to pass a test of their abilities in the united states and the united emirates for instance they dont have to pass a test just an interview
2032786 its a pity they dont keep nurses in the czech republic
2032787 its a question of money and work environments its not a prestigious job if you are a nurse you must love the job
2032788 the nursing profession is not valued as it should be
2032789 the nursing profession needs to become more attractive more money and prestige will keep more nurses in their jobs and bring more nurses to nursing schools
2032790 they dont like to be transferred there are language barriers and this country has such a high standard of living
2032791 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists

2032825 but for the other churches is their membership and laity willing to do what is necessary to serve as god s elizabeth on the anglican communion amp the trajectory we are on 15 heart so he went quietly away or was told to go quietly away it suddenly got very quiet i did look at his verbal total visitors right now titusonenine amp stand firm 421 here and can also be reached by clicking the blogs button in the top menu kjs incursions do not reflect positively thursday august 7 2008 4 10 pm reported to have made the following statement today it was nearly universal that incursions do not reflect positively on the mission of the church and that the incursions present challenges that people haven t considered the overwhelming majority see incursions as inappropriate and an act that needs to cease that said i m not terribly hopeful that they will stop it was universal 5 years ago that consecration of an indivdiual in a non celebate relationship would lead to the rendering of the anglican communion despite the agreement of all present including then presiding bishop frank griswold that consecration went forward if his consecration proceeds we recognise that we have reached a crucial and critical point in the life of the anglican communion and we have had to conclude that the future of the communion itself will be put in jeopardy in this case the ministry of this one bishop will not be recognised by most of the anglican world and many provinces are likely to consider themselves to be out of communion with the episcopal church usa this will tear the fabric of our communion at its deepest level and may lead to further division on this and further issues as provinces have to decide in consequence whether they can remain in communion with provinces that choose not to break communion with the episcopal church usa it has become quite clear that the episcopal organization hears only its own voice and is seriously confused about many issues including the origin of the spirit they claim to follow and the challenges being faced in the anglican communion either katharine jefferts schori has been played into the biggest dupe this side of christendom or is standing in the control booth bishop sisk added that he was surprised how little was known about our gracious restraint in the communion as a whole how could this possibly be never before has there been restraint so exceedingly gracious and the quality of the restraint is extensive if not overwhelming as to be a sure and meet foundation for our limitless graciosity challenged only by our volume of our humility and meekness the presiding bishop added there was a major lack of information and also major misinformation around the communion concerning this episcopal church of ours the basic theological tenants that we believe were not even known in many places in the communion
2032826 there is serious doubt whether we are even in a christian community
2032827 we havent talked about the gospel we havent talked about salvation and we havent talked about the fact that the mission of the church is to proclaim the one hope that we have in the world the lord jesus christ the fact that we have missed the very central message of christianity says a lot about what is happening in the anglican communion
2032828 a hostile entrance into or invasion of a place or territory esp a sudden one raid
2032829 i am thankful to the african bishops for extending an olive branch to our american churches that feel they should not be under the authority of the orthodox cannot will not

2032831 just when i think youve said the stupidest thing ever you keep talking
2032832 but for the other churches is their membership and laity willing to do what is necessary to serve as god s instrument to attract new members will they sacrifice financially in order to build new buildings where prospective members live rather than dying a slow death in rented facilities in less favorable parts of town

2032839 the new studio provides the company with the means to provide our partners in europe with a flexible responsive and high quality service for every single project post production is a critical aspect of development but one which is often overlooked as a pioneer in the mobile gaming sector distinctive understands what a huge difference it can make to the long term success of a game we are determined to offer development and publishing partners the same exacting standards we insist on for our own titles
2032840 the increasing complexity of mobile titles and the growing demand for guaranteed standards of quality control mean post production is fast becoming the factor determines whether a game reaches its maximum potential and a truly global audience

2032861 for people who are gay and lesbian we can give the impression that we are more harsh in our dealings with them than with any other group of people
2032862 that must impair our mission and leave them feeling rejected

2032875 if you dont put in the time to really prepare and test your argument something will go wrong and thats the heart of poor advocacy
2032876 i think any time youve got friends of yours who are being held incommunicado against their will in a communist country you have to have some level of concern
2032877 if you had invested in our company on january 10 1997 you would have earned a yield of 437 percent as of year end 2007 so we have had great success
2032878 other companies are doing this the company needs to be competitive its not going to effect the older workers theyre going to retain their first tier pay rate there wont be any concessions
2032879 thats the kind of agreement we have to have at telus
2032880 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare

2032885 well have it working in time for the opening of the beijing olympic games
2032886 the problem came when we converted the system from the test environment to the live environment in routing calls through from our network centers to the ibm research systems in california the network architecture was designed to put calls through the telephone system for as far as possible before going onto the internet to reduce latency
2032887 all our services are scaled for much broader use than we see because we care about quality we always have a big margin for special circumstances the only time weve been stretched was when we offered free calls for christmas when we saw a million calls in two or three hours theres no reason for everyone to use the babel system at the same time
2032888 we are really unique in the convenience store industry and with our business model locating stores in smaller rural communities throughout the midwest
2032889 the majority of our stores are in towns of 3 000 person population or less we serve not only as the gas station but also in many cases the grocery store and restaurant
2032890 we make from scratch not only pizza but donuts as well and offer a wide variety of other products
2032891 in fact we are a top 10 retailer of pizza and donuts in the nation we also own all of our assets which is unique in the business and self distribute about 90 of the grocery products in our store it comes out of our distribution center centrally located here at corporate headquarters
2032892 being located in smaller communities there is less competition not only from a convenience store perspective but less competition from a quick serve restaurant perspective from an entry level labor perspective lower cost to build and even lower cost to purchase when we go under acquisition strategy
2032893 we have very low debt a very strong balance sheet
2032894 in fact we would be considered investment grade so i think all those components kind of rolled up sum up the success of our company
2032895 people are still coming into our stores they are still buying the soda or the cup of coffee or donut or a slice of pizza or whatever they are buying
2032896 for example with gasoline several years ago a load of gasoline would cost 10 000
2032897 now a load of gasoline is somewhere between 30 000 and 35 000 we turn our gasoline about every three days and our payment terms are 10 days i am pretty confident that some of the smaller operators would not have that same type of payment term its been quite frankly a crunch on working capital for some of the smaller operators

2032908 thats very good for a player all the niggles clear up and you come back hungry and motivated again
2032909 the first week back was a bit tough but it always is
2032910 weve still got about another three or four weeks of pre season to go but im feeling pretty good
2032911 we were pretty used to rob and dai who did a great job together so it is a bit different
2032912 but its exciting as well weve got new coaches with new ideas and its good to share their thoughts
2032913 we want to do better than last season and to do that weve got to finish higher up in the magners league which means winning it and reach the semi final in europe
2032914 thats obviously easier said than done but if we can keep everyone fit weve got a chance weve got a lot of players coming back from injury and weve got a good strong squad
2032915 it is difficult playing the tri nations teams but if you want to see where you are in world rugby youve got to play the best teams
2032916 theres no point playing romania japan or whoever you win the games but you dont really learn a lot from them
2032917 when you play new zealand australia and south africa you see where you really are
2032918 i feel we are ready for the challenge and i really hope we can pull off a big scalp
2032919 they are going to come to us and we are going to play them at the millennium stadium knowing we can actually beat these teams if we play well on the day

2032936 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2032937 what should be news is the rank hypocrisy of williamss willingness to lay at the feet of canadian and american anglicans the blame for divisions in the communion when the only difference between whats happening in our churches and in his is that were telling the truth about it
2032938 i know dr williams thinks the church is important but this is almost saying the church is more important than belief we had a reformation to change that view
2032939 they would have told us immediately if they would have suspected it involved any of our people

2032946 dumping the 25 emissions based congestion charge scrapping probably the biggest purchase order for zero emission vehicles in the world and abandoning the 50 affordable housing target are all evidence of a major backtrack
2032947 boris is adopting or considering a number of policies that are likely to increase londons carbon footprint these include endorsing a 50 increase in flights from london city airport and considering a new airport in the thames estuary
2032948 in addition he has supported an extra river crossing downstream from tower bridge to ease traffic congestion which could lead to a rise in the number of vehicles on londons roads if this was a road crossing
2032949 despite recognising that climate change is one of the biggest threats facing london boris has failed to secure the team he needs to deliver on his promise to cut carbon emissions by 60 by 2025 this can only add to fears that he will seek to cut spending on climate change projects
2032950 by not appointing environmental experts johnson is missing the chance to build on the good work already being done in london there must now be very real concerns as to whether boris has any plan or strategy to maintain london as a world leading sustainable city
2032951 tackle crime deliver value for money and improve the quality of life for all londoners
2032952 the real challenge facing london is how to get the capacity to invest and deliver on the huge multibillion pound projects from crossrail and the olympics to the rail extensions and tube upgrades which this city needs to continue to grow and prosper
2032953 but they have appointed a team with expertise in downsizing and are talking about continuously about small government and cost cutting quite simply they have got the wrong analysis of what london needs
2032954 the proposal doesnt concern muslim students in this sense there are already a great number of mosques in turkey

2032961 the finding has changed our perspective from a planet that has been dry and dead to one that is icy and active
2032962 of all the solar system planets has the climate most like that of earth both are sensitive to small changes in orbital parameters
2032963 now were seeing that mars like earth is in a period between ice ages
2032964 these extreme changes on mars provide perspective for interpreting what we see on earth landforms on that appear to be related to climate changes help us calibrate and understand similar landforms on earth furthermore the range of microenvironments in the antarctic dry valleys helps us read the mars record
2032965 one of the mantras going in in terms of when we developed
2032966 too many missouri vets in rural and other communities currently lack access to such essential services
2032967 ive looked closely at senator obamas record on issues like this i know we can trust an obama administration to provide veterans with the services they deserve and the benefits they have earned
2032968 i was born in timbuktu and when i was 4 we moved to outer mongolia and then when i was

2032970 when i first got into the business i was 12
2032971 before i finalized my worldwide itinerary my friends suzanne and nolen recommended that i add cinque terre to the italian leg of my trip i never heard of the 5 fishing villages nestled along the coast of northern italy but trusted their judgment since they did a 1 year tour themselves several years ago i am so glad i followed their advice since the five terres are just what most websites describe them as breathtaking and untouched dubbed a unesco world heritage site this national park is the perfect place to hike shop lounge or completely veg out while enjoying a small carafe of wine and tortellini this is exactly the way i spent my days while i was there
2032972 we climbed a lot more steps and walked a lot longer six hours to be precise than we have done altogether so far on this trip there were olive groves vineyards spectacular views of the coastline interesting cemeteries via del amore path of love and steep drops from the side of the unbelievably narrow trail at the end of the day it was well worth it we rewarded ourselves with yummy popsicles and a really good pizza along the way we also took a boat ride to get more of the scenery and the best part of it all jumped in the sea it is the clearest bluest water i have ever seen the water was so good that the incredibly rocky beach could not spoil it today has been one of the best if not the best day of our trip so far i cant put a finger on it the people the scenery the food the laid back attitude blue skies bluer water views from our apartment it all adds up
2032973 the expulsion female ejaculate and asked outsiders to characterize it
2032974 hm interesting that could be a nifty alternative to viagra
2032975 who in their right mind would do something that stupid
2032976 did you happen to see a small film he did called bandage club it was a little contrived
2032977 hi i just wanted to let you know that ive put ryuganji on japan in
2032978 hi ana yes it is http www phantom film com ne ws index html
2032979 we are seeing increased interest in our gps ip solutions as navigation and localization technologies proliferate across devices and markets
2032980 todays device manufacturers are looking to integrate gps functionality in embedded systems because of the cost area and time to market benefits especially in high volume products our gps ip is silicon proven allowing customers get to market quickly with low risk
2032981 these four new coolpix cameras represent the latest in style design and quality and offer superb images the s560 is attractively priced the s710 provides outstanding quality and performance connectivity and image sharing options are available with the s610c and speed is a remarkable feature of the s610 whatever your preference theres a coolpix for everyone
2032982 the core of this trial is consumer choice and the premise is that consumers ought to make that decision not microsoft microsofts argument that says java would have died anyway is a little bit like saying if somebody shoots you they can defend themselves by saying you have cancer
2032983 i have spoken with maureen ogara based on go ahead from brianv and planted the story
2032984 these arent activists theyre not protesters these are people intent on coming to events to offices to peoples residences and theyre intent on breaking the law
2032985 well what hes doing is a workshop theres not going to be any trashing of any premiers offices in bella coola as far as i know its a workshop its educational and yes it is political and people have a right to be political people who have been convicted of drunk driving can be in politics so to suggest thomas should not be allowed to discuss the things he has experience with i think would be a silly argument
2032986 like me you probably bookmarked the thread planning to paint the mural once you finally got round to attending those drawing classes youve been planning to attend for 10 years
2032987 he says he was just trying to get her to stop
2032988 nelly has the attitude the swagger and most of all the physique that our customers can both aspire and relate to and lets be honest all of the ladies out there are going to be thanking us for this campaign
2032989 i was offered a job that didnt offer health insurance which was a big reason i didnt take it
2032990 i think it would have been one less stress i did definitely feel the pressure financially not knowing what i would do next
2032991 weve worked with a lot of students whove had health issues who havent had the means to get the necessary help so this clearly is a perfect way of supporting them
2032992 having this added layer of medical support gives them more time to make their next decision
2032993 it was a scary because when i needed to go to the doctor i knew i had to pay for it
2032994 by extending coverage to age 26 its probably more beneficial for the patients
2032995 bear is driving songs shift seamlessly from melodic math riffs with warm spacey ambiance to brutal prog metal riffs with off meter dissonant noise vocal sample loops regardless you will hear an amazing breadth of influences compiled to form a sonic experience you have never encountered before
2032996 its difficult really because the matches in june were played under the old laws the tri nations is being played under the new laws plus another few where everything is going to penalties and free kicks
2032997 so it has been a little bit difficult to judge that when you know its going to be a little bit different for us from august 1
2032998 a lot of the free kicks that are being given now will be full on penalties at the moment its tap and go or take a scrum
2032999 the line outs could come back into vogue a bit more than they are in the tri nations at the moment where there seem to be probably more scrums than there are line outs statistically which is a bit of a change from what we had
2033000 i suppose we wont fully know it and thats why it will be important to get the players in on games from the start of the season this year just to find their way themselves
2033001 with the elvs the passages of play are just going on for so much longer i think there was one super 14 game that went to six minutes at the very start whereas before a three minute phase would have been very long
2033002 id say we can expect three four or five of those in a game now a few more two minute phases and thats going to put its own demands on players too but its only perception
2033003 everybody is saying that the ball is in play more but the fact that its in play might not mean it is being run with ball in hand
2033004 there seems to be a lot more kicking than there was before and that is why mark tainton has been out and about with the players over the last three or four weeks
2033005 thats a skill we are going to have to improve on and it wont be good enough that just one or two guys are going to be able to kick the ball in the coming season
2033006 yesterday i found myself thinking i wanted a chocolate while at the same time i was perfectly aware that i didnt really i wouldnt enjoy it if i had one
2033007 the citys fog bound darkness falls earlier as a result and transforms this friendly suburbia into the stage for a stand off an urban tybalt stands on the pavement trainers worth more than my daily wage jeans sagging a sharp hair cut gold stud in his left lobe

2033011 on the issue this ad has brought up sen collins does not support the employee free choice act and she believes that all workers are entitled to a secret ballot on this ad she finds it ironic that a public servant elected by a private ballot would vote to deny union employees the same right

2033015 oh dear oh dear oh dear tiggerweinman make the pain go away with obscure music
2033016 i cannot like because they are not hardcore obscure enough and refuse to be at all informed about them
2033017 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2033018 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2033019 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2033020 sen clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states
2033021 she is very appreciative of the continued commitment of her supporters and understands there are passionate feelings around the convention while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with sen clinton and her staff the dnc and sen obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
2033022 completely idiotic idea that leads to nothing but party disharmony
2033023 its a reflection of genuine frustration by hillary clinton supporters that sen obama seems to have forgotten about 18 million voters
2033024 my concern about sen obama is he doesnt recognize that the outreach to the clinton grass roots has to be more visible more overt as well as more symbolic
2033025 her supporters want after 18 million votes and the record of success from march 1 through june 1 to feel recognized and i think we should
2033026 we will have this in hand for sen clinton should this be needed
2033027 its been a tradition since the late 1800s its a nominating convention you vote you nominate someone and you come out unified i dont see how alienating 1 800 delegates gives you party unity when we walk out of the stadium
2033028 hillary delegates feel like were not welcome needed or valued
2033029 what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
2033030 and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they have a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2033031 and thats what we want people to feel we do not want any democrat either in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying well you know im just not satisfied im not happy because i mean thats what im trying to avoid
2033032 we value your support we want to return the favour

2033036 the new rules suit south africa better and the springbok tactics suit the new rules
2033037 in the world cup we saw them kick a lot they had a very solid defence and a lethal counter attack
2033038 we are expecting a very physical confrontation but the springboks are not just emphasising the physical side they are also becoming more intelligent and exposing their rivals deficiencies more
2033039 i believe the springboks are the best team in the world at the moment they are the world champions and they have started well in the tri nations
2033040 it is an away game for us and you wouldnt choose to play the best team in the world when most of your players are in the middle of their pre season as your first outing under the new rules
2033041 have you seen advertisements for products such as coral calcium or alkaline water that are supposed to neutralize acid in your bloodstream taking calcium or drinking alkaline water does not affect blood acidity anyone who tells you that certain foods or supplements make your stomach or blood acidic does not understand nutrition
2033042 vinegar is acidic and is used as a digestive enzyme protease lipase and amylase are all acidic enzymes that breakdown proteins in the stomach and make the over all ph of the stomach more acidic most all supplements that help with digestion are acidic and will lower the ph of the stomach
2033043 when you take acidic digestive enzymes you force the cover cells of the stomach to start to produce sodium bicarbonate to buffer the acidic protease lipase and amylase in order for the stomach to produce sodium bicarbonate to buffer acidic supplements foods or drinks it must pull sodium chloride water and carbon dioxide from the blood this can cause sodium and chloride deficiencies of the blood leading to enervation also for every molecule of sodium bicarbonate produced by the stomach an equal amount of hydrochloric acid is produced which is taken up into the blood through the gastric pits causing an acidification of the blood the blood cannot withstand the slightest decrease in alkalinity so the hydrochloric acid is taken up by the connective tissues and the fatty tissues leading to latent tissue acidosis and the cause of all sickness and dis ease the body may also pull calcium magnesium and potassium ions into the blood to buffer the excess acids from the stomach this may also cause bone muscle and other tissue loss due to the loss of these alkalizing ions this is the cause of tissue wasting in degenerative dis ease the secondary affects of taking acidic digestive enzymes and or eating acidic foods or drinks is the damage to the delicate intestinal villi of the small intestine when this happens the body cannot produce healthy stem cells erythroblasts and then erythrocytes leading to all blood disorders and then tissue disorders without a healthy small intestine it is impossible to make healthy blood and without healthy blood it is impossible to make healthy body cells that make up body organs
2033044 this is where gabe mirkin does not understand or has conveniently forgotten that the stomach lining secretes an equal amount of sodium bicarbonate into the the stomach to alkalize the food drink and supplements we eat with an equal amount of hydrochloric acid take up by the blood the hydrochloric acid produced when the body needs more sodium bicarbonate to alkalize falls into the gastric pits of the stomach and ideally never comes in contact with the food as the sodium bicarbonate rises to the front to alkalize the food or liquids ingested the equation is nacl h20 c02 lt gt nahc03 hcl the stomach begins producing and releasing sodium bicarbonate an alkalizing compound immediately when you put food or drink into your mouth you can test the saliva after eating or drinking an acid food and you will find that in a healthy person the ph of the saliva goes up to an 8 ph or greater when you put something into your mouth the salivary glands immediately begin secreting sodium bicarbonate to increase the ph this does not happen when you eat or drink an alkaline food or drink another simple experiment will show you that when you combine sodium bicarbonate with hydrochloric acid in a flask the hydrochloric acid will fall to the bottom of the flask as the sodium bicarbonate will rise to the top this is what happens in the stomach the sodium bicarbonate made from the cover cells of the stomach rises to the front to meet the food or liquids ingested as the hydrochloric acid falls into the gastric pits of the stomach away from the food or drink ingested the primary purpose of sodium bicarbonate rising to the forefront is to alkalize the food not digest or acidify the food the stomach is an organ of contribution not digestion and its main contribution is sodium bicarbonate to alkalize the food and liquids we ingest
2033045 all food coming out of the stomach should be alkaline in preparation to be received by the small intestine at a ph of 8 2 to 8 4 if the food comes out of the stomach into the duodenum less then an 8 ph the pancreas and the gallbladder will secret additional sodium bicarbonate to bring up the ph of the liquid food to an 8 2 to 8 4 ph the secretion of sodium bicarbonate is only possible if the foundational elements of sodium chloride carbon dioxide and water are available from the blood the stomach is the major organ for producing the alkaline sodium bicarbonate and is responsible for alkalizing not digesting the food and liquids we ingest
2033046 the food enters your intestines where secretions from your pancreas neutralize the stomach acids so no matter what you eat the food in stomach is acidic and the food in the intestines is alkaline
2033047 the pancreas and the gallbladder are only second in line or back up glands to bring up the ph of the food or liquids ingested to the ideal 8 2 to 8 4 by secreting sodium bicarbonate the akalizing of our food and drink is important so that the liquefied food can be transformed into new stem cells in the crypts of the small intestine or the root system of the body for making new blood if the liquid food is too acidic it will destroy the intestinal villi leading to many if not all sickness and dis ease including all blood disorders
2033048 there is no such thing as a cancer cell there are only cancerous cells which are healthy cells that have been spoiled with dietary and or metabolic acids when you increase your alkalinity by simply using sodium bicarbonate not only does your urine ph go up above 8 but your tears your sweat and your saliva will also go up our bodies are alkaline by design and acidic by function any food or drink that we ingest that will maintain that alkaline design will preserve the body from aging and keep it healthy energetic and youthful our body cells love alkalinity just like the ocean fish that swim in a ph of 8 3 my research indicates that body cells thrive in mild moderate and high ph fluids ranging from 7 3 to 11 ph body cells do not tolerate even a mild acid state in fact cancerous cells thrive in a ph of 5 5
2033049 the body runs on electrons not enzymes the enzymes of the body are the exhaust or the acidic waste products of energy consumption we no more need enzymes to run our body then a car needs carbon monoxide to run they are both acidic waste products of metabolism or energy consumption that need to be eliminated as quickly as possible through their exhaust systems for the human body acids would be eliminated through urination perspiration defecation or respiration
2033050 when you hold your breath carbon dioxide accumulates in your bloodstream very rapidly and your blood turns acidic and you will become uncomfortable or even pass out this forces you to start breathing again immediately and the ph returns to normal if your kidneys are damaged and cannot regulate the acidity of your bloodstream chemical reactions stop poisons accumulate in your bloodstream and you can die
2033051 here gabe is talking out of both sides of his mouth he is right when you hold your breath and the blood cannot purify itself from the acidity and you would die but this is the same thing that happens when you over indulge in acidic lifestyles and diets and the body cannot eliminate the acids fast enough through its elimination organs so dietary and or metabolic acids that are not eliminated are thrown out into the blood and then into the connective tissues and fatty tissues leading to latent tissue acidosis the only cause of dis ease if this process continues and the lymphatic system does not or cannot eliminate the acid buildup through perspiration or back into circulation and then eliminated through urination the acidic body wastes will begin breaking down the tissues even while the blood is maintaining its alkaline state at 7 365 to 7 4 when the acidity of the tissues continue the blood over compensates by pulling alkalinity from the bones and muscles into the blood and we note a remarkable increase in the blood ph from 7 36 to 7 4 to 7 5 when the ph of the blood increases in alkalinity we now know that the tissues are acidic and the body is in latent tissue acidosis if this continues and the alkaline reserves of the body begin to be used up the ph of the blood will reverse and go from a state of alkalosis or latent tissue acidosis to compensated acidosis to decompensated acidosis until death that is why we see very sick people wasting away as the body is pulling its alkaline mineral resources from the bones and tissues into the blood to to maintain the delicate ph balance of the blood at 7 365 to 7 4 when a person understands that the human body is alkaline by design and acidic by function and is actively engaged in maintaining that alkaline design through an alkaline lifestyle and diet it is theoretically impossible to loose bone mass or muscle mass or to get sick or tired
2033052 certain foods can leave end products called ash that can make your urine acid or alkaline but urine is the only body fluid that can have its acidity changed by food or supplements
2033053 alkaline ash foods include fresh fruit and raw vegetables acid ash foods include all animal products whole grains beans and other seeds these foods can change the acidity of your urine but thats irrelevant since your urine is contained in your bladder and does not affect the ph of any other part of your body
2033054 alkaline foods include low sugar fruits green vegetables healthy oils whole unprocessed salts and alkaline water acid foods include dairy products animal flesh eggs vinegar soy sauce peanuts corn high sugar fruits high sugar root vegetables like potato and beet mushrooms algae coffee tea tap water tobacco marijuana most all prescription drugs just to name a few for a complete updated list of acid and alkaline foods and drinks read the ph miracle for weight loss by dr robert and shelley young
2033055 the ph of the urine is a direct indicator of the ph of the body tissues when the urine ph is acidic you are more likely to be sick and or tired when your urine ph is alkaline or above 7 2 ph you are more likely to be healthy and fit people who are sick will always have an acidic urine ph people who are healthy and fit will always have an alkaline ph it is that simple that is why i have said for years if you want to be healthy and fit you have to pee and sweat your way to health
2033056 when you take in more protein than your body needs your body cannot store it so the excess amino acids are converted to organic acids that would acidify your blood but your blood never becomes acidic because as soon as the proteins are converted to organic acids calcium leaves your bones to neutralize the acid and prevent any change in ph because of this many scientists think that taking in too much protein may weaken bones to cause osteoporosis
2033057 right on gabe you finally got something right the body does pull calcium ions from the bones and magnesium ions from the muscles to buffer the organic acids from animal proteins to maintain the delicate alkaline ph of the blood but it is very important to remember when you are pulling alkaline minerals from the tissues and organs to maintain the alkalinity of the blood you end up with acidic tissues and organs that leads weak and brittle bones tissues and organs
2033058 eating animal proteins results in the release of uric nitric sulphuric and phosphoric acids which the body tissues and organs do not manage well you can test the morning urine after eating animal proteins and note the lowered acidic urine ph the morning urine ph is a direct indicator of tissue ph and a persons lifestyle and dietary choices over the last 24 hours
2033059 gabe and i are in agreement that the body pulls
2033060 cranberries have been shown to help prevent recurrent urinary tract infections but not because of their acidity they contain chemicals that prevent bacteria from sticking to urinary tract cells
2033061 cranberries contain antioxidants that buffer the acids in the fluids of the body including the urinary tract bacteria is the result of cells that have transformed because of the over acidic state of the body acids act like molecular glue the antioxidants of the cranberries help to buffer those acids with alkaline compounds thus reversing the very thing that causes the infection metabolic and or dietary acid
2033062 taking calcium supplements or drinking alkaline water will not change the ph of your blood if you hear someone say that your body is too acidic and you should use their product to make it more alkaline you would be wise not to believe anything else the person tells you
2033063 the human cell is immortal as long as we maintain the alkaline fluids that it is bathed in
2033064 well john mccain has always been influential in the senate in part because of the positions he holds i dont think influence is determined necessarily just by position hes obviously influential out of recognition of his chairmanship of the commerce committee but hes also influential because he can work with democrats on key issues whether its campaign finance reform or tobacco policy hes worked with us and that has made him i think a source of great influence in the senate
2033065 you may end up going against a senate colleague perhaps mccain perhaps frist
2033066 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
2033067 what i do know is that john mccain is a close and dear friend of mine i have enormous respect for him hes a courageous patriotic american who stands up for what he believes and im proud to call him my friend
2033068 well first of all let me say that i admire senator mccain greatly hes one of the people we modeled our campaign over because he is very direct very blunt and nobody has to guess at what hes thinking which i think is people people would like to see a lot more of that in politicians around this country
2033069 you know i love john mccain hes a great guy the fact is we do disagree on iraq but i think that on the overall fight against terrorism and that thats the number one priority theres a lot of agreement john and i have been to baghdad together twice and talked about this at length so obviously im gonna be supporting a democrat for president of the united states but i have a very high regard for john mccain and this is just an area of disagreement we agree tremendously on reform and worked together well and im proud to serve with him in the senate
2033070 since coming to washington ive believed that the right approach begins with the proposal put forward by senator lieberman and senator mccain a proposal theyve been pushing for years and i thank them again for their leadership on this issue the lieberman mccain bill establishes limits for greenhouse gas emissions well into the 21st century to remain below these limits the bill encourages the market to determine how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rewarding cost effective approaches using a system of tradable allowances
2033071 i think that i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002

2033118 in addition to a hiring freeze we should also freeze salary increases for politically appointed state employees further governor gregoire should suspend salary negotiations with state employee groups over pay increases until we know the full extent of our deficit next year

2033168 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win

2033172 according to a recent report by the united nations the employment imperative report on the world social situation national policies aimed at counteracting these trends and lowering unemployment have largely failed the report shows that in their desire to remain or become more competitive governments and employers around the world have taken many steps to increase labor market flexibility but this has merely contributed to greater economic insecurity and greater inequality while failing to achieve either full or productive employment as promised

2033184 both rating agencies acknowledged that the districts trans borrowing is designed to smooth out uneven monthly revenue streams and the periodic cash deficits they create and is not reflective of any fundamental cash weakness or overspending
2033185 the agencies also cited strong debt service coverage early set asides for trans repayment and significant non general fund resources as factors for awarding the district the highest possible rating

2033193 the chances of key local polls taking place in iraq this year all but vanished yesterday after parliament failed to pass a law on elections because of a row over the contested city of kirkuk which threatens to heighten arab kurdish tensions
2033194 the iraqi parliament speaker ended an emergency parliamentary session wednesday after the political blocs failed to reach an agreement over a disputed provincial election bill parliament speaker mahmoud al mashhadani said by the end of the 44th session on wednesday the parliament concluded its first legislative term and would resume sessions on sept 9
2033195 roughly half of the 48 billion dollar budget of 2008 approved earlier by the parliament
2033196 i can confirm to you that we have lost the chance to hold the elections in october
2033197 iraqi politicians officials and western diplomats have speculated that the political parties in government were never invested in holding a vote this year out of fear they would lose seats and influence at the provincial level senior politicians including president jalal talabani a kurd and vice president tariq hashimi a sunni arab have been absent from baghdad during the round the clock negotiations citing medical reasons
2033198 the elections would be the first provincial balloting in almost four years
2033199 i listened to many of them i noticed that most of them talk about kirkuk in a way as if its a prey for the greed and abmitions of their parties they never talk about it as a part of iraq because they dont care about iraq they care only about their limited personal interests
2033200 special inspector general for iraq reconstructions recent findings about how rich iraq is with oil money
2033201 yes its true that the iraqi government is spending little on reconstruction the weak iraqi capability to do big projects maybe at the end of 2008 will improve
2033202 signs of iraqs slowness to rebuild are everywhere in baghdad roughly 20 of the city is without proper sewage pipes published statistics say the baghdad is getting roughly 11 hours of electricity a day on average but many residents go days with only sporadic bursts of power iraqi officials say fixing just this problem could take up to 10 years chronic electricity shortages for another decade mean little energy for construction making iraqi hopes for a renewed capital seem distant
2033203 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2033204 this is projected and not real money we have many reconstruction projects and as you know most of the infrastruture of the country had collapsed after the war and that needs a lot of money to rebuild the country
2033205 as of december 31 2007 the iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of 29 4 billion held in the development fund for iraq and central government deposits at the central bank of iraq and iraqs commerical banks
2033206 from 2005 through 2007 the iraqi government generated an estimated 96 billion in cumulative revenues of which crude oil export sales accounted for about 90
2033207 the source of this surplus is the high price of oil money thats added to the pot when we fill our family gas tank
2033208 with oil prices at or near all time highs it has become increasingly apparent that iraq is closer than ever to financial independence with the extreme property damage caused by an invasion of questionable legality the need for security and reconstruction monies is great but who should be held accountable many us taxpayers are becoming disenchanted due to the fact that with nearly 33 billion in oil earnings in the first half of 2008 iraq is now capable of shouldering an increased share of the burden our own economy is floundering and many simply feel that it is time for iraq to step up and assume control over its own destiny
2033209 two numbers 482 billion and 79 billion the first is next years projected federal budget deficit a record the second is the budget surplus that iraq is expected to accumulate by the end of the year is there any question which government whose taxpayers should be footing the bill for reconstruction projects in iraq
2033210 something is out of whack iraqis are very proud to say that its their country and they are right so they should fix it
2033211 many iraqis who lack adequate electricity clean water and jobs find it unfathomable their country is awash in oil dollars last year it spent less than a third of the 12 billion budgeted for major projects such as electricity housing and water
2033212 five star hotels parking garages a theater restaurant aquarium and basketball courts casino and boat rides but given the lagging basic services reporters questioned whether baghdads priorities are appropriate and realistic with temperatures hittign 130 degrees many parts of iraq dont have a steady electricity supply and some areas only get two hours a day getting clean water and adequate health care are also major issues

2033223 the media is in a cultural rut i am not talking about their private incisive skeptical conversations with one another i am talking about the questions they dont ask the questions they ask give me a bunch of 10 year olds instead of the white house press corps and the president would be far far more upset and anxious dont be so cynical about small starts if nature was like you seeds would never have a chance to sprout

2033306 its true that we dont exactly represent a majority of secular kibbutz members but the pioneers have always been a minority the zionists were a minority among the jews those who came to the land were a minority among the zionists those who worked the land were also a minority and now we are a minority as well but i hope that soon we will be the leaders
2033307 well the word religious can be the subject of long discussions look the gerrer rebbe once said when the haskalah enlightenment came to the world with science physics etc we the religious left it for the secular jews when zionism came to the world we gave that too to the secular and now we have also left the repentance movement for the secular accordingly it looks like we the secular will also have to build the beit hamikdash
2033308 there are many religious authorities including maimonides who say that the temple must be rebuilt and so i think it should be done as a first step we must show that we control the temple mount i call upon all of israel to come to the mount on tisha bav and show that it belongs to the jewish nation

2033316 last year was a little bit unique being my first year and with the amount of injuries we had both up top and in albany of the ahl we ended up using 40 players in carolina and 65 players in albany i dont think i saw it unfolding quite like that my first year but the job has lived up to my expectation so far
2033317 probably just all the different things that go into it from a players standpoint you are focused on conditioning and getting ready to go and when the season starts its about games and practices on this side you get everything that goes into it from ticket sales to marketing to drafting to player development there are so many facets to the job as hurricanes gm jim rutherford told me last year when we were going through all those injuries its not always like this but its always something and you never know what its going to be thats been bang on
2033318 on the player development side you are trying to get to know the kids you have drafted in the system watch their games and find out areas where you can help them with advice on conditioning or diets areas that will make them better on the assistant gm side youre learning the big thick book they call the cba you have to know that and pay attention to that as a player i went through a lot of negotiations but its different on this side with multiple agents and multiple players the one thing is its never dull
2033319 just to enjoy it leading up to it there are a lot of things youre looking at youre trying to get your speech down pat you want to make sure you dont forget anybody so youre worried about that when i got there the first night the hockey hall of fame had a cocktail reception i walked into that room and there were a lot of former players who are now members all there thats when it hit me throughout the weekend it was tremendous there were enough events that were special and made the weekend but there was enough time that you had to enjoy the weekend with friends and family that came to be with you it isnt that its about you its how they do the whole weekend and everything that is associated with it i really would just tell them to take time to enjoy it
2033320 i have never been to russia in my life so its hard to talk about it but there are certainly players going over there and playing any time there are other options for players its better for them and at some point people might consider it a threat for the nhl but people look at the nhl and the talent that is here and nobody is going to argue that it still the best place to play if you are a hockey player
2033321 i get asked that a lot and im sincere when i say im just taking it a day at a time im comfortable in the role im doing here im fortunate and glad to be working with a guy like jim rutherford who has experience and has been through this for a while i am just enjoying doing what im doing i have really not looked down the road i have said that in three to five years ill either still be in this role or ill be in retirement all over again
2033322 i always said no but i should never say never its not an area i wanted to go into and at this point i dont think i have changed at this point on my thoughts but i should never say never
2033323 i think there is so much parity in the league now and its so tough to get from october to april and accomplish what you want to do we got off to a tremendous start last year and we struggled through november december and half of january that is ultimately what cost us but along the way we also lost rod brindamour matt cullen and numerous other guys we used 40 different guys on the roster last year and it came down to losing the last game of the season to miss the playoffs our goal is to win the stanley cup and anything short of that is not successful we feel we got better on the blue line where we needed to get better and we have enough firepower up front to score goals and our goaltending is good at least on paper were comfortable where were at
2033324 i think he can do it whether he does or not well have to see that at training camp he is an exceptionally smart player his hockey sense is tremendous and hes played at some pretty high levels at the world junior championship and in the canada russia series last year which was pretty unique he stepped into albany after his junior season was done and looked like he had been there all year he worked hard to put some muscle on hes up in the 180s we think hes big enough hes gotten strong enough we think hes ready
2033325 im probably at least six to eight months of two or three a days away im very content watching the young guys my hats off to chris chelios for doing what he does for a guy that played against him its great to see him out there competing and still having success i cant right now and i have no desire to

2033402 accelerate the commercialization of plug in hybrids promote development of commercial scale renewable energy invest in low emissions coal plants and begin transition to a new digital electricity grid
2033403 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say okay
2033404 will create jobs and lessen our dependence on foreign oil
2033405 is better than a freeze on development on a particular type of energy
2033406 then we should pursue it because what we dont want is to produce more greenhouse gases
2033407 cases where excessive speculation may be driving up oil prices
2033408 mechanisms to reduce the burden of rising prices such as expanding resources for the federal weatherization assistance program increasing federal support for state and local level efforts to relieve the burden of rising energy prices on low and moderate income families and helping permanently expand the low income home energy assistance program which helps families pay their heating and cooling bills
2033409 take 3 billion a month out of the highway trust fund and hand it over effectively to our oil companies
2033410 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
2033411 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
2033412 ignores our biggest energy challenges subsidizes mature energy industries like oil and nuclear and rolls back our environmental laws
2033413 does nothing in the short term to rein in the soaring fuel and energy prices because of the lag time it will take to extract the allowed oil and gas

2033419 support the development of alcohol based fuels establish a permanent research and development tax credit to support energy innovation and will encourage an even handed system of tax credits for renewable energy sources like wind solar and biomass
2033420 stakes are high for our citizens and for our economy
2033421 broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production and i believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use
2033422 with the ultimate goal of eventually constructing 100 new plants
2033423 i have supported storage but i also am cognizant and respectful about the environmental and other provisions that have to be met in order for yucca mountain to be a suitable place for storage of spent nuclear fuel mccain said in june 2008
2033424 harness the power of the free market and the engine of american innovation to reduce the nations greenhouse gas emissions substantially enough and quickly enough to forestall catastrophic global warming
2033425 all a windfall profits tax will accomplish is to increase our dependence on foreign oil and hinder exactly the kind of domestic exploration and production we need
2033426 has the size capacity cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug in hybrids or electric cars
2033427 we wont fix high gas prices by stifling oil exploration or adding new taxes or expensive regulations what we can do is embrace a basic principle of economics the best way to keep energy prices down is to increase supply
2033428 gas sold in the united states contain 7 5 billion gallons of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel by 2012
2033429 a nasa like effort to motivate and stimulate american ingenuity and technology using research and development tax incentives to help free our nation from its dependence on foreign oil within twenty five years
2033430 state funds to clean up former industrial and commercial sites that are contaminated unused or abandoned
2033431 the last thing we need is centralized government planning when it comes to our precious energy supplies
2033432 had responsible development in anwr not been vetoed by president clinton in 1995 that energy and the jobs it would have created across the country helping to provide fuel for the american economy today
2033433 balanced approach to energy security that increases domestic supplies reduces demand for oil and gas and promotes alternative fuels and other diverse energy sources
2033434 a balanced course of building more power plants and erecting more transmission lines
2033435 ive got a problem with my landlord he recently informed me that he was raising my rent by 20 percent with immediate effect he said if i did not pay the increased rent from the start he would kick me out what can i do
2033436 the first thing john needs to check is whether the rent increase was negotiated collectively with involvement of the swedish union of tenants or whether the landlord raised it unilaterally
2033437 if the rent is collectively agreed then the tenant must pay the increased amount from the start he can then appeal the rent increase to a rent tribunal hyresn mnden which can force a reduction if the rent is deemed unreasonable
2033438 in order to challenge a collectively agreed rent the tenant has to provide evidence that nearby apartments of a similar size and standard are cheaper
2033439 if the rent is not collectively agreed i e if the landlord decided to raise it himself then the tenant can continue paying the old rent it is then up to the landlord to go to the rent tribunal to force the tenant to pay the new rent
2033440 if john at first paid the increased rent but then decide to challenge it he should initially write to the landlord if he does not succeed in obtaining a reduction this way he can take the landlord to the tribunal
2033441 its hard to say without knowing johns exact circumstances but a 20 percent increase sounds like a lot however big rent rises can sometimes be permitted when significant improvements are made to an apartment block this could include renovations of bathrooms and kitchens
2033442 as for the question of whether john could be evicted for not paying its possible but not easy a landlord can terminate a contract in certain circumstances for instance if the tenant withholds the entire rent and not just the difference between the old and the new rent in cases where the landlord has unilaterally raised the rent eviction proceedings for non payment cannot start until the rental tribunal has made its ruling generally eviction is rare and usually only applies in the case of serious breaches
2033443 the situation is slightly different for people living in a sublet apartment a second hand contract or andrahandsuthyrning or for people renting an owner occupied apartment bostadsr tt from its owner
2033444 if john wants advice on his particular circumstances for instance to obtain guidance on whether the rent is reasonable he can contact the swedish union of tenants

2033450 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking senator mccain to task for a steady stream of false negative attacks his campaign has launched yet another
2033451 or as some might say oops he did it again our dependence on foreign oil is one of the greatest challenges we face in this election the american people have a real choice between obamas plan to provide tax rebates to american families while creating a renewable energy economy in america that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil and senator mccains plan to continue the same failed energy policies by handing out nearly 4 billion in tax breaks to oil companies while investing almost nothing in the new energy sources that represent our future
2033452 nobody here thinks that bush or mccain has a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared about me
2033453 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
2033454 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bill
2033455 if you want to be the man you have to beat the man
2033456 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bill
2033457 obama will change the way we pursue energy we can switch to wind solar and biofuels brazil a third world country has done it why cant the us
2033458 theyll tell you have a crazy wife or that im black or muslim or dont look like the other guys on the dollar bills etc
2033459 we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america
2033460 rayven no obama hdopes not have any experience you just simply choose to ignore anything othert than what you choose to read and believe
2033461 washington intensified attacks by republican john mccain on the character of his democratic opponent have coincided with barack obama losing a 9 percentage point advantage in a national poll which showed the candidates running dead even over the weekend
2033462 another strong example of the serious ramifications that can come from letting impressionable teens play violent video games like this one
2033463 if you look at the whole population youth violent crime has gone down dramatically since the 1990s while playing computer games has gone up exponentially
2033464 it may be that a kid attracted to criminal behavior is also attracted to violent games
2033465 you cant make the simple statement that if you expose a kid to violent games then hell become violent

2033480 after weeks of late night negotiations and under intense u s pressure iraqi lawmakers failed to pass a much debated provincial elections law wednesday before adjourning for the month the failure to pass the law which would govern elections in provinces across the country may push the elections into next year if elections dont happen by the end of this year it could be july before the balloting could be carried out u n spokesman said arikat said
2033481 a special session of parliament sometime during the recess which ends sept 9
2033482 days of intense negotiations and heavy pressure from the u s the united nations and britain
2033483 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a local elections law
2033484 its interesting what i find interesting about this report as well is when youre looking at these two countries iraq and afghanistan seeing how vastly different iraq is from afghanistan in terms of the natural resources that they have afghanistan is a very poor country one of the poorest in the world iraq will come back much faster given that they had some semblance of infrastructure as crumbling as it was but something to work from afghanistan is being built from scratch and so i thought that was something worth taking away
2033485 i saw the report i saw the reports about the report so id refer you back to the state department just to as they wake up this moring just to make sure that theyve looked at it because i dont know all the details
2033486 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
2033487 weve done a lot for the iraqis just in terms of the numbers themselves
2033488 ill tell you what concerns me and most of my constituents you said many times the gains in iraq are fragile and reversable so my constituents and i believe that
2033489 you have to wonder why the best that you can say is that the gains are fragile and reversable
2033490 and i listened carefully to senator hagel and ambassador crocker from the answer you gave him i dont get the
2033491 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
2033492 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
2033493 iraqs oil income will more than double this year baghdad continues to spend only a small percentage of its own money on reconstruction and services while it banks billions in surplus funds
2033494 between 2005 and 2007 only 10 percent of iraqs expenditures went toward reconstruction with just 1 percent spent on maintaining u s and iraqi funded investments in roads water electricity and weapons according to a report released yesterday by the government accountability office even when baghdad has allocated larger sums the report said it has spent only a small portion of the budgeted money
2033495 left little doubt that iraq which racked up 32 9 billion in oil earnings from january through june can afford to pay more for its own reconstruction
2033496 driving through iraq you feel the neglect here in basra the city is rivers of sewage destroyed buildings and bridges from war after war after war every day i pass by the same buildings destroyed years ago during the u s led invasion in my neighborhood in baghdad every day they look exactly the same a pile of rubble the electricity problem seems to be getting worse iraqis have an average of about four hours of electricity a day while there is talk of reconstruction a bridge here flowers planted there the people dont feel a change
2033497 one thing thats very important is how they are spending their money which is distributing it evenly amongst the around the country but amongst the different sects as well so shias sunnis and kurds its something that theyre going to have to continue to work out we want them to take on more of their own responsibilities just from a security standpoint but also reconstruction also if you remember prime minister maliki went into sadr city basra and mosul he offered immediate financial assistance to people who were living there under those terrible conditions
2033498 it is good for their psychological health it is good to take care of the appearance to see the building a new clean
2033499 school kits to iraqi refugee children distribution of uniforms shoes and school materials and is expected to outfit 30 000 children from damascus and rural damascus before the start of the syrian school year on sept 7 last year unhcrs distribution reached 20 000 iraqi children
2033500 its really important that they figure out a way to quickly get that money to those people directly i think theyve made a lot of progress on that but they needed to do more
2033501 notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of armored security vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 206 milliion
2033502 the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of light armored vehicles as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 3 billion the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of technical assistance for construction of facilities and infrastructure as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 1 6 billiion the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of helicopters and related munitions as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 2 4 billion the defense security cooperation agency notified congress of a possible foreign military sale to iraq of m1a1 and upgrade to m1a1m abrams tanks as well as associated equipment and services the total value if all options are exercised could be as high as 2 16 billion

2033512 there was a conversation i didnt write her a letter or pink slip her
2033513 he changes my perspective on what life is and what matters
2033514 the new york daily news reported in july that usher was disappointed that his cd
2033515 mama we see w what had happen was see well mama i need u sob
2033516 allegedly a 14 year old girl looks to be about 60 i say that with concern and love
2033517 she allegedly wants to be a singer and or actor slash performer of some sort striptease person i dont know
2033518 people are just cruel this is bad karma for him
2033519 let me just reiterate i feel bad for the 14 year old daughter she seems like a nice person but she should be a kid not in a reality show
2033520 i think anderson cooper is an opinionated hypocritical idiot who should be an adult and keep his opinion to himself
2033521 he is the last person to judge anyone when he and his own family have their own issues
2033522 it looks like the evil troll known as mary kate olsen was able to answer the feds riddle correctly
2033523 he whispered into her ear and she listened with rapt attention he brushed his hand on her back they had nice chemistry
2033524 is involved they are obviously fucking the last person i listened to
2033525 catherine keener of being john malkovich of death to smoochie of walking and talking of into the wild of 40 year old virgin how can some of you not know who she is
2033526 rapt did edgar allan poe rise from the dead to witness this shit
2033527 d listed is like chicks who hang out together for a long time they start getting their periods the same day
2033528 and benicio sort of looks like brad pitt if you take a shot of whiskey squint your eyes turn your head upside down and play with yourself at the same time he will look like brad
2033529 rapt did edgar allan poe rise from the dead to witness this shit
2033530 submitted by bradiful bitch on august 6 2008 5 59pm
2033531 submitted by toni on august 6 2008 5 00pm since he likes the younger girlies i find this hard to believe of mi boricua
2033532 we have given our nation every opportunity to link with the technologically developed world we have been able to raise computer literacy in the country to 25 without trumpeting about it in a country that did not attach much importance to it
2033533 the generation that swore it would never get old didnt
2033534 supposed to be a bit like this but it is very good to see
2033535 since last summer the same pattern has occurred at least six times lousy economic and financial news that lead to an equity market fall then surprise action by the fed or the government to stimulate and rescue markets
2033536 negative feedback loop between the financial system and the broader economy
2033537 like all marketers today were constantly learning about staying relevant to younger audiences
2033538 a natural fit with the brand and what were passionate about and a new way to engage younger demographics
2033539 con cinco horas de bloqueo se pudieran comprar los dializadores que se utilizan para las hemodi lisis por un a o
2033540 un minuto de bloqueo equivale a los materiales de construcci n empleados en una vivienda
2033541 3 d as de bloqueo equivalen a los l pices libretas y dem s materiales de un curso escolar
2033542 they must have thought that if they hired me id retire soon
2033543 the world has changed since they last went job hunting and some dont have a clue what to do
2033544 your resume may get you in the door but how you handle the interview determines whether you get the job offer
2033545 if you dont believe that your age and experience would be assets to potential employers why should they believe it
2033546 the best way to dispel those stereotypes about older workers is to make sure youre not that kind of person
2033547 be flexible be willing to keep up with new trends in your field be computer savvy
2033548 no one expects you to look like youre 20 but you should look neat trim and up to date
2033549 keep your conversation on a professional level youre there to convince them you can help them but dont overdo it and make them think youre after their job
2033550 though older workers dislike bragging on themselves a job interview is no time for modesty
2033551 no one else will walk through the door to tout your qualities so its up to you
2033552 stay focused talking about your children or grandchildren wont get you a job
2033553 a good response is to say outright that your top priorities arent title or money
2033554 emphasize that youre a hands on person who because of your experience can hit the ground running and can be trusted to get the job done
2033555 ive accepted the fact that im a mature worker to me that means i have a lot of patience im a loyal employee i have a strong work ethic i dont require supervision and i have a lifetime of experience theres no way im retiring
2033556 prepare for it as you would an in person interview and when the call comes find a quiet place to talk so youre not distracted by whats going on around you
2033557 most people have to be talked into it but theyre often glad they did it
2033558 they see some silly facial expression or hear some awkward response and they suddenly have the motivation to do better
2033559 tell the interviewer youre more convinced than ever that youre the right person for the job
2033560 and then ask when the company will reach its decision
2033561 make it a handwritten note in this day and age of e mail that personal touch will be remembered
2033562 google verr t was wir suchen und wo wir suchen
2033563 i know how to promote myself my brand and my message
2033564 i love it primarily for the efficiency but one of the bonuses is there are people we wouldnt have considered otherwise
2033565 we did an interview for an internship last night with a woman in paris
2033566 we will compress the hiring cycle by making it easy for candidates to take interviews on their own time and employers dont have to worry about time zone schedules or travel
2033567 get coaching if video is required and if video is not required skip it all together
2033568 its totally different than sitting in front of someone for a live interview you have 30 seconds to read the question and at the same time you have to think of an answer the green light comes on and all of a sudden youre being recorded
2033569 but i have an idea to make shia lebeouf the lead character next time and have harrison ford come back like sean connery did in the last movie i can see it working out
2033570 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2033571 the key got turned and ill be damned if i cant shut it off
2033572 crisis for women and their children in the family law courts
2033573 use family court to stalk harass punish and impoverish their former partners and children
2033574 ontario superior court justice jennifer mackinnon ordered springfield to return to england with her two daughters kita 8 and freda 6 whom she adopted with her long time partner sarah courtney six years ago
2033575 wheeler 36 and her partner missy decided to start a family together and share the wheeler last name in 2000 sara wheeler gave birth to a son gavin through artificial insemination two years later they decided missy wheeler should adopt the child and legally become his second parent
2033576 sara and missy wheeler had split by july 2004 and missy was fighting for joint custody of the boy sara wheeler is now doing something she once would have considered unthinkable arguing that gays dont have the legal right to adopt children
2033577 dass sich paypal von seiner urspr nglich konzipierten treuh nderfunktion f r ebay mehr und mehr abgel st hat und mittlerweile von vielen h ndlern im internet als bezahlmethode angeboten wird kann ich best tigen
2033578 da paypal eigentlich zu dem zweck gegr ndet worden ist vors tzlichen betr gern bei der kaufabwicklung auf ebay das leben schwer zu machen muss man nun weiter vor allem in die mobile verf gbarkeit des bezahlservices investieren um langfristig konkurrenzf hig bleiben zu k nnen
2033579 wir hatten ein organisches wachstum mit ebay gehabt da h ndler paypal aber fernab von ebay nutzen und den service auf ihre eigenen seiten integrieren haben wir uns damit arrangiert

2033583 there are a lot of answers given some of them having to do with the psychology of climate change there are uncomfortable conclusions in reflection about what to do and some of it gets in the way of our thinking
2033584 barry baracks nickname was muslim he was registered as a muslim because his father was muslim
2033585 senator obama has never been a muslim was not raised a muslim and is a committed christian
2033586 bush claiming to be christian has made him any better
2033587 yet our village atheists want to have it both ways they want to reject god but preserve at least certain core aspects of the christian legacy nietzsche would have had nothing but scorn for these little men of unbelief lilliputians hurling their tiny javelins at the christian god while they continue to live off his inheritance
2033588 what is the source of that liberty equality and fraternity that are now the guiding principles of the west if not the modern world
2033589 historians note the anomaly that these principles originated and developed only in western civilization in this sense they are not universal of late however these principles are being exported to the rest of the world one may say they are western in origin but universal in their application
2033590 with the death of heidegger and sartre jurgen habermas is now regarded as perhaps our leading living philosopher habermas is also an atheist yet when habermas found out that the european union in its charter gave full acknowledgement to ancient greece and rome but none to christianity he erupted in learned outrage
2033591 habermass argument is that it is philosophically illiterate to locate the roots of the west in athens but not in jerusalem
2033592 for the normative self understanding of modernity christianity has functioned as more than just a precursor or catalyst universalistic egalitarianism from which sprang the ideals of freedom and a collective life in solidarity the autonomous conduct of life and emancipation the individual morality of conscience human rights and democracy is the direct legacy of the judaic ethic of justice and the christian ethic of love
2033593 habermass point is that there is too much arrogance in contemporary atheism even the atheist is standing on mountain erected by christianity how ungrateful it is to scorn the mountain that is still holding you up how ridiculous the posture of the man who cannot acknowledge the very foundation that sustains him from below
2033594 this is what christians mean when they say that america is a christian society
2033595 habermass argument would have struck a chord with the greatest atheist of modern times the philosopher nietzsche nietzsche argued that if you want to get rid of the christian god at least have the honesty and the guts to repudiate the christian ideals of human dignity human equality and human liberty
2033596 yet our village atheists want to have it both ways
2033597 why did the creator of the entire universe need to impregnate a human female
2033598 we are all born with the same sexual instincts but we learn whether we are male or female or something in between only after we are born
2033599 featuring rich graphics quality audio and one thumb controls beijing 2008 and sonic at the olympic games both complement and extend the video game line up for the olympic games

2033621 we dont run across many people who are not income eligible
2033622 the quantum of solace ive written it down ill remember it now
2033623 if this is not war then i wonder what is
2033624 as a result of the hours long shelling of tskhinvali by heavy weaponry the city is almost totally destroyed
2033625 we cannot allow the deaths of our countrymen to go unpunished the guilty parties will receive the punishment they deserve
2033626 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2033627 we have lost control over some parts of the city
2033628 we are a freedom loving nation right now under attack
2033629 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
2033630 this morning a unhcr staff member reported that many buildings and houses have been destroyed and that only military personnel are moving on the streets
2033631 water is also in short supply a chronic problem worsened by recent events most transport has stopped and shops are running out of food
2033632 we have many people with strong will we will fight against earthquake disaster and organize relief
2033633 we have many natural disasters but well able to build better country future
2033634 nancy pelosi has said no to a vote on a comprehensive energy bill
2033635 brain plasticity occurs in response to the environment the task at hand and our thoughts and imaginings
2033636 in some cases the faster you can imagine something the faster you can do it
2033637 structural plasticity in the adult brain is modulated by experience
2033638 as we age our expert knowledge remains strong and our capacity for solving problems within our areas of expertise can often exceed that of those who are younger
2033639 weve been confronted two years in a row with under strength teams coming to australia from the northern hemisphere
2033640 in 2007 wales fronted up under strength and then this year the french showed up under strength
2033641 apart from the impact it has on the fans the viewers at home sponsors broadcasters and the look and the damage it does to the integrity of test match rugby the financial cost to the aru over two years was 1 6m
2033642 not obliged to accept an inbound team that doesnt comply with irb regulation 9 which means best available
2033643 the alternatives we need to look at includes whether in that window we look at the wallabies going to new zealand and playing the blues crusaders and hurricanes and the all blacks coming to australia and playing a combination of australian super 14 teams
2033644 remember the lions tour of 2001 canberra stadium packed sfs packed brisbane packed you are talking about a full strength all blacks side playing against a full strength nsw team and so forth that would lure a crowd
2033645 were not being bolshevik about it we are simply saying that we cant rely on the quality of the northern hemisphere teams our audience is disillusioned were hurting and we should be allowed to look at alternatives were looking to expand super rugby and thats our commitment when that happens it will fill the june window that will hopefully be in place by 2010

2033647 microsoft microsofts argument that says java would have died anyway is a little bit like saying if somebody shoots you they can defend themselves by saying you have cancer
2033648 under one initiative dubbed the microsoft active protections program mapp redmond will provide security providers with detailed information about upcoming updates mapp is only open to companies that offer a commercial product to microsoft customers against network or host based attacks authors of attack kits are not eligible
2033649 the restrictions on who gets the information makes sense given the potential for abuse should it fall into the wrong hands
2033650 if only i could believe that was their only motive i can imagine the the bullshession where they discussed how to dilute and marginalize the open source sector how soon will some pretend thrir party publish studies showing how non commercial open source security are worse than the ms certified ones
2033651 the report also suggests that microsofts recent publication of protocol documentation for its core products could have an overall damaging effect on the company
2033652 the availability of protocol licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsofts own
2033653 in both cases its still mildly ironic to see idg making money with open source but paying money to microsoft
2033654 proprietary companies microsoft ibm etc have legally fought open source to snuff out competition
2033655 i have spoken with maureen ogara based on go ahead from brianv and planted the story

2033665 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes
2033666 sulforaphane compound found in broccoli is a powerful antacid or alkaline buffer that protects the blood the blood vessels and other organs that sustains life broccoli is one of the most powerful vegetables for anti aging that is why i included broccoli florets and broccoli sprouts in my latest anti oxidant anti aging products called doc broc power plants and phruits and pholage

2033670 the games still about doing your basics well about preparing well and making sure every stone is turned
2033671 in this team theres a lot of confidence weve got a lot of youth but with that youth comes a lot of energy a lot of enthusiasm and a real focus and hunger
2033672 what we need to do now as a group of people is mould that together so were all going the same way but as far as commitment goes the effort isnt lacking in these boys and come friday i think youll see the result of some pretty good training and a pretty focused performance
2033673 we never fired a shot and we couldnt carry out our game plan
2033674 all in all everyone is pretty gutted with what happened
2033675 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it

2033688 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2033689 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2033693 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters again thanks for being in touch please do not hesitate to let me know if i may ever be of assistance to you or your family
2033694 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
2033695 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee if he is found by the house to be in contempt of congress he can be imprisoned for an amount of time determined by the house not to exceed the term of the 110th congress which ends the beginning of january 2009 or until he agrees to testify the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
2033696 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice
2033697 u s codetitle 2 the congresschapter 6 congressional and committee procedure investigationssec 193 privilege of witnessesno witness is privileged to refuse to testify to any fact or to produce any paper respecting which he shall be examined by either house of congress or by any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or by any committee of either house upon the ground that his testimony to such fact or his production of such paper may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous

2033731 thats what brohm meant when he said i never dropped his balls
2033732 you know if you had this type of protection on the field last year you might have had a winning season and gone to a bowl game
2033733 i was off to change my j crew patchwork madras shorts and f lee bailey underoos
2033734 one of those trinity gangstaz were gettin all ghetto and hood up in here
2033735 its time to use my ninjitsu for good for you see i am not a blogger nor a lawyer but a super white kentucky fan ninjaaaaaaa
2033736 i have a bright nfl career ahead of me please old man im still young
2033737 nfl are kidding me you will play your 3 years and then be cut and have to get a real job like teddy dupay
2033738 if that were really brohm how do u think it wouldve played out
2033739 i am the best story teller let me tell you how it would go down
2033740 most likely to wait in line for a sporting event
2033741 what the hell i cant believe it matt jones is being beaten like a government mule

2033750 thats 175 000 that voted against the blunt bush agenda and opposed the republican hierarchy of the state
2033751 i do not accept that attempt to reframe himself hes part of the washington status quo
2033752 it was kenny hulshofs decision to embrace the failed policies of matt blunt that was his choice
2033753 hes the one who embraced the matt blunt healthcare cuts
2033754 i dont accept that healthcare coverage is dead on arrival
2033755 i think steelman was clearly focused on fiscal responsibility and the value of washington he defended earmarks her message was in essence a message of change it ultimately came very close but it was unsuccessful with the hierarchy of the republican party
2033756 roy blunt and others embraced kenny hulshof down there and they lost
2033757 her voters said no to the values of washington and yes to main street not k street
2033758 she gained votes on directly and appropriately questioning his fiscal responsibility
2033759 it would not surprise me to see this race tighten
2033760 geh rt die street parade zu z rich wie das sechsel uten
2033761 i shoot u im brainless if u shoot me u famous
2033762 do you give online presentations dont let this happen to you
2033763 edwards is no longer an elected official and he is not running for office now dont expect wall to wall coverage
2033764 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that

2033771 the original iphone was the catalyst that created this huge market interest in touchscreen phones the fact that it was not only popular with consumers but also helped drive data revenues proved how important touchscreen handsets can be now all of the network operators and handset manufacturers want a piece of the pie
2033772 consumers are ready to do more with their mobile phone and centro has struck a chord around the world

2033780 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs

2033784 if israeli u s or european intelligence gets proof that iran has succeeded in developing nuclear weapons technology then israel will respond in a manner reflecting the existential threat posed by such a weapon
2033785 israel takes iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejads statements regarding its destruction seriously israel cannot risk another holocaust
2033786 actually increasing the nationalist fervor to build a nuclear weapon
2033787 must be wiped out from the map of the world

2033791 the store allows users to purchase games as well as other applications directly from the iphone itself with just a few taps on the screen the process is much simpler than with other phones
2033792 phone carriers havent advertised the fact that their customers can play games on their phones
2033793 analysts and game publishers also say that the release of the new iphone itself will raise the profile of the entire mobile gaming industry and make non iphone users more aware that they can play games on their phones
2033794 the apple iphone 3g is a dramatic example of this transformation
2033795 in the days following our exclusive u s launch of this new device powered by the nations fastest 3g wireless network customer response has been everything we had anticipated and more this strengthens our wireless business and it reinforces our positive view of the opportunities ahead for at amp t and the industry
2033796 it seems that children with ad hd often lack that sense of control that comes much more easily to their non ad hd peers playing casual games such as peggle and bejeweled among others is one area in their lives in which these children can experience some sense of control with the added benefit of achieving success in something both of these aspects taken together can serve to enhance the childs self concept and self esteem

2033802 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
2033803 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon
2033804 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
2033805 we firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries
2033806 maintaining and promoting basic rights and freedom of its citizens
2033807 chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law these facts are well known regarding the sino u s differences on issues including human rights and religion we have always insisted on dialogue and communication based on mutual equality and mutual respect in order to enhance understanding reduce differences and to expand consensus
2033808 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
2033809 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2033810 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
2033811 has placed america in a better position to be honest and direct on other issues
2033812 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
2033813 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2033814 growth sparked by chinas free market reforms is good for the chinese people
2033815 chinas new purchasing power is also good for the world because it provides an enormous market for exports from across the globe
2033816 act responsibly on issues such as energy the environment and african development
2033817 discuss ways to ensure long term growth and widely shared prosperity in both our economies as well as issues like currency exchange rates and intellectual property rights
2033818 we dont really read most of the bills do you know what that would entail if we read every bill that we passed
2033819 i feel we have some kids like shawn matthias and michael frolik that could be ready to play
2033820 steve lonegan is the conservative leader new jersey taxpayers need to take back our state from jon corzine and his administration of tax and spend liberals
2033821 as mayor he froze spending and debt and kept taxes far below inflation no one speaks out louder or stronger for taxpayers and in defense of our conservative values than steve lonegan he is not only the strongest candidate we can run against jon corzine he is the best man for the job
2033822 if implemented the corzine coah low income housing plan will destroy new jersey by forcing every single town to pay for creating its own slum area with high density urban style low income apartments and townhouses
2033823 lonegan was not only our only hope to save our state but our last hope
2033824 we cannot afford to lose this election and with steve lonegan as our candidate we wont
2033825 steve is a fighter and isnt afraid of either corzine or his money hes got guts and thats something we havent seen in a statewide candidate in a long long time
2033826 i can think of no better leader for our cause than michael doherty not only has assemblyman doherty been a true conservative voice in new jersey politics but hes fought for conservative issues from day one
2033827 people are coming to our office in record numbers with very high utility bills
2033828 its pretty pathetic when the only thing saving someone from disconnection is being flooded out
2033829 and while there is scant evidence of second round effects as wages remain subdued indicators of long run inflation expectations have risen further
2033830 ai distributori non importa nulla dei minori a loro importa solo dei loro affari
2033831 vorrei sapere quanti minorenni ordinerebbero online e aspetterebbero la consegna per potersi alcolizzare
2033832 ma certo qui i genitori non riescono ad evitare che i ragazzini si procurino armi da fuoco e adesso si aspettano veramente che questa regoletta prevenga le sbornie
2033833 mai saputo di minorenni che comprano vino su internet potendo approvigionarsi dalcol nel negozio dietro langolo con una carta didentita falsa
2033834 quale minorenne beve vino non vi ricordate da ragazzini si usava roba da quattro soldi per ubriacarsi
2033835 from an australian point of view they might decide to target a couple of uncapped props with great potential for instance
2033836 if certain super 14 teams believe they are low in a particular area then they will go out and find the right person to fill that position
2033837 it will be important for northern hemisphere clubs to make sure their players dont end up in a position where they can be stolen from underneath them
2033838 nine times out of ten they are firm and fast tracks in australia and some guys would feel that would be an experience for them
2033839 it has also got to be appealing to the player which means things like financially the style of rugby location and all those sort of things
2033840 so it is not just a question of heres another competition off you go to wherever and play
2033841 we are moving towards transformation at super rugby level and allowing foreign players to be involved with our teams not for the first time is part of that evolutionary process
2033842 when the game first went professional and super 12 was launched there was an opportunity for australian teams to recruit overseas players
2033843 it proved an immensely successful venture in some instances patricio noriega went on to play for the wallabies after being signed to the brumbies from argentina where he was established as a world class prop
2033844 tiaan strauss captained the springboks before heading to australia to play rugby league and then super 12 with the waratahs tiaan also went on to play for the wallabies in the back row
2033845 those cases cannot be replicated in this era players now are only allowed to represent one country
2033846 the re introduction of foreign players however will have advantages for our teams for our fans and for overseas marquee or emerging players wanting to experience the best provincial competition in the world
2033847 we must tame this no more excessive risk taking by investment banks because that leads to systemic risk
2033848 the markets always find a new way to make a fool out of you
2033849 i have you for tomorrow at 6 30 pm can you do it then
2033850 no because i was supposed to come tuesday at 6 45
2033851 i think im done with therapy i really dont want to go it feels like such a chore it shouldnt feel like such a chore

2033854 he gave a prized car a ferrari with his racing number 82 on it to a good friend
2033855 the sudden move angered his children its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on
2033856 the word theyve been given is that he has only a few weeks to live
2033857 there are a lot of what they call refund schemes
2033858 people who use these things use homeless people drug addicts prostitutes
2033859 especially in our culture mostly elderly like old people they really need the young people who speak english very well
2033860 everybody they come to my sons house and beg him to help them out to do the tax income
2033861 then why they didnt just send a letter and say you cannot do that i just want to know why they send the money
2033862 i arrived this country for 28 years now i never got a driving ticket i try to be good in this country
2033863 so elegant yet the woman has that little bit of a vulgar look you could not ask for a more stunningly eye catching cover i think
2033864 the realignment of cifas functions and resources into dia strengthens the close historical and operational relationship between counterintelligence and humint
2033865 integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap
2033866 its quite obvious that 2k is taking full advantage of the ps3s blu ray discs to pack in cleaner high resolution textures for every facet of the game
2033867 ever since we got our web site up weve been putting more and more stuff on it
2033868 recent questions surrounding the spending decisions of the ottawa visitors center unease over the financial situation of the elementary school district and heightened concern directed toward elected officials regarding the illinois state budget highlight just a few reasons illustrating the need for more public understanding about the budget process at every level of government
2033869 its simply a matter of making government more accessible to the taxpayers
2033870 if were doing everything right we dont have anything to be ashamed of
2033871 i dont know the details but i guess the mechanics would be pretty much decided by the council
2033872 allied assets advisors fund a delaware registered trust other fund board members at the time included jamal said the imam at a fundamentalist controlled mosque in illinois
2033873 i think that mazen asbahi is a victim of what i would call the anti muslim smear and fear campaign that we have seen in this election cycle time and time again in this case like many the allegations started on a web site that did not corroborate what they are allegating sic with any evidence they stated that he had certain links with fundamentalists in this case the allegation was against imam jamal said who i know personally to be a great american faith leader and not a radical imam as the wall street journal falsely stated
2033874 a list of our organizations and the organizations of our friends
2033875 on the general strategic goal for the group in north america
2033876 members of the us muslim brotherhoods palestine committee and or its organizations
2033877 i think the obama campaign is out to get votes
2033878 i think it was their judgment that to allow this to continue as a controversy would hurt their chances of getting votes i think it was a decision made based on that
2033879 just shows how islamophobic the political climate is right now baseless smears about a muslim with a very good reputation was used to marginalize not only him but the community from the political process if someone like mr asbahi cant be vetted to work for the obama campaign then who can
2033880 symptomatic of a nationwide effort by islamophobes who seek to deny muslims access to the political process
2033881 the difficulty of charting the waters of islamophobia in this election cycle
2033882 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
2033883 i would simply be uncomfortable being in a campaign that would be inevitably attacking barack obama
2033884 i think it would be uncomfortable for me and i think it would be bad for the mccain campaign
2033885 i think theyve crystallised their message and i think theyre hitting a nerve
2033886 its true i am close to signing a deal to write a book but everyone should hold on i have lots of stories ive never told and they will all be in my book
2033887 as in the past this tour will be divided into four sections
2033888 riccardos a new young talent if you look at madonnas history with fashion that makes him an obvious choice
2033889 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
2033890 we said in the referendum that we didnt want that and now hes put it in the decrees
2033891 thats the problem we have all the powers are concentrated in the president
2033892 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohammed i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
2033893 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2033894 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2033895 currently movies are being produced and shown in 3d in cinemas with advances in digital cinema improving the experience
2033896 pre packaged content and games have the storage and processing power to deliver 3d video and televisions are available today that can render 3d content standards ensuring 3d content is usable to the maximum extent by consumers will benefit the industry
2033897 the concept of energy and the flow of that energy in the human body is the core of the current explosion in healing
2033898 as we felt new power flow in as we enjoyed peace of mind as we discovered we could face life successfully as we became conscious of his presence we began to lose our fear of today tomorrow or the hereafter we were reborn
2033899 we had a new employer being all powerful he provided what we needed if we kept close to him and performed his work well established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves our little plans and designs more and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life

2033913 it destroys the pjs theory that the couple accidentally killed madeleine and then tried to dispose of her body
2033914 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
2033915 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken

2033941 as part of the conspiracy the cocaine was possessed for distribution in canada
2033942 it was part of the conspiracy that clay franklin roueche douglas vanalstine daniel russell and others arranged to possess and did possess cocaine from southern california mexico central america and south america and they continued the possession of the cocaine in this district and elsewhere for eventual distribution
2033943 as part of the conspiracy the cocaine was possessed for distribution and was distributed in canada australia and elsewhere
2033944 the prosecutors represented to the court at my detention hearing that i have not held legitimate employment and that all that i may have comes from illegal activity

2033953 una feminizaci n de las organizaciones comunitarias en las que crecientemente predominan las mujeres incluso en el sindicalismo mientras en la vida pol tico partidaria no se produce lo mismo
2033954 reglas ritos y l gicas propias de la vida partidaria donde la participaci n de las mujeres resulta m s dif cil la actividad pol tica partidaria tiene grandes dificultades para las mujeres por distintos motivos horarios estilos pr cticas etc
2033955 hace diez a os esta preocupaci n no exist a y hab a una invisibilidad respecto a un asunto que hoy se debate intensamente
2033956 hay que hacer esfuerzos para provocar innovaciones en la representaci n pol tica
2033957 no es un pacto estrictamente electoral sino un acuerdo pol tico que parte de identidades distintas pero converge en la necesidad de cambiar el sistema electoral
2033958 es un acuerdo incompleto con resultado incierto porque tenemos que medir si los electores de la concertaci n votar n por el juntos podemos al rev s se ha probado muchas veces
2033959 todav a hay plazo para retirar candidaturas y queremos profundizar el acuerdo
2033960 quiero rescatar que en esta materia hemos tenido una presidenta y una ministra de salud de absoluta indiscutible y activa decisi n sobre la responsabilidad de las pol ticas p blicas hacia los derechos y la autonom a de las mujeres en relaci n a la anticoncepci n
2033961 ha pagado un alto costo por eso cuestionada por la derecha la iglesia y los medios de comunicaci n vinculados a la derecha pero ha seguido adelante
2033962 nadie puede dudar del coraje con que ministra de salud ha enfrentado estas dificultades
2033963 dificultades que enfrenta responde al ordenamiento jur dico que ninguna autoridad puede desafiar
2033964 el movimiento a favor de reformas a la educaci n no gan nada con ese gesto
2033965 it takes years to figure out what theyve got and where it should go
2033966 it means that your mother and father taught you right and you did what you were supposed to do
2033967 what you did was right and appreciated by people in the community
2033968 the people who have received it have made such outstanding contributions to the sport
2033969 you like to be able to make a positive impact on history and this certainly falls into that category
2033970 i think its like sesame street that old song that says three of these things belong together and one of them is not the same
2033971 i dont know i got the list with the other three guys to me its a huge honor its a very important award its certainly something i dreamed of winning
2033972 any award you receive is a great honor especially something that involves usa hockey
2033973 when you start your journey as a young kid you are playing because you love the game and have a passion for the game when usa hockey gave me a chance to play on a national team before i got drafted in 1982 youre thinking this is a big chance but youre never thinking of setting out to get awards and be honored being able to receive these awards is something that is a privilege to me
2033974 when i worked for gary bettman at the league from 1993 98 i started going to the luncheon every year and seeing the guys that won it and how special it was to them and the pride they received when they won it
2033975 i knew it was a big deal but i hadnt fully appreciated it until i saw the guys that i knew personally win it
2033976 when usa hockey gave me a chance to play on a national team before i got drafted in 1982 youre thinking this is a big chance but youre never thinking of setting out to get awards and be honored being able to receive these awards is something that is a privilege to me
2033977 the impossible came true and when i receive this ill receive it on behalf of all of the folks who made it possible
2033978 that would be all the hockey fans in minnesota and everybody who helped take cinderella to the ball
2033979 by the second or third year marty and i were having dinner in port huron and we were talking about how we thought there would be a heck of a lot of good hockey players coming out of the u s
2033980 we were talking michigan at the time because thats what we knew but it has proven true
2033981 you do them because you believe in what youre doing
2033982 people say you look like mc hammer on crack humpty
2033983 whatever happens tonight you totally represented for b boys and breakdancers

2033986 when we opened in hale we took our product range from our london stores and transplanted it to hale in retrospect it wasnt the best plan
2033987 being in london i think you can get a bit detached from whats going on in the rest of the country opening in hales been a a steep learning curve
2033988 shoppers in hale care more about local foods some will only buy organic but a lot of our customers want to support local producers even if that foods not certified organic
2033989 sourcing local produce is a lot easier in cheshire than in the capital you cant really get meat or milk thats anything like local in london but weve secured suppliers in cheshire lancashire and yorkshire and thats come through customer demand
2033990 weve got things like cheshire apple juice and crisps from yorkshire its taken a bit of work finding suppliers but its been fun
2033991 the nature of organic produce means that it is more expensive
2033992 for example you can buy chicken drumsticks instead of breast and eat more things like lentils
2033993 weve not really seen any impact on our sales yet but i am a bit scared
2033994 well have to wait to see what happens but from what ive seen i think people are eating out less and choosing to cook at home instead so weve not really noticed any changes
2033995 it was great to see someone as high profile as hugh fearnley whittingstall promoting free range and organic chickens
2033996 however i think if as many people cared as much as they say they do theyd be going down the high street going to bakeries and butchers not popping into the supermarket
2033997 we want to promote the saviors of the holocaust to the world and tell people of the importance of lifesaving to the next generations through real stories we also want to include these real life stories to school curriculums as well
2033998 kent wanted nazi officers to release 80 jews claiming that they were turkish citizens when german officers rejected kents demand he and his interpreter got in the train as well germans had to release jewish group lest it could cause a diplomatic crises between turkey and germany

2034003 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
2034004 i am looking for 50 brave men or women from 49 states and the district of columbia to join me in suing the state in our respective states to prevent them from posting the name barak h obama on the november 2008 ballot until he presents incontrovertible proof that he is a u s citizen
2034005 the secretaries of state are the ones who by placing a person or initiative on the ballot certify that the candidates or initiatives meet the legal requirements to be on the ballot
2034006 the office of the president is simply too important to trust to someone other than a person whose loyalties are 100 percent american and while it is impossible to read into the heart of a man or woman we do have the test our forefathers gave us which is this office is not to be entrusted to anyone but a natural u s citizen
2034007 the revelation that the birth certificate of obamas own sister was evidently used to create the electronic forgery represents what supporters of this analysis claim is a smoking gun that appears to implicate sen obama directly hawaii law limits access to vital records to family members only a fact which slowed down the ability of researchers to compare the purported obama birth certificate which displayed from the start a peculiar provenance and inexplicable features to genuine specimens therefore it would seem that either maya k soetoro ng as she is now called supplied the document or its image to half brother barack or his campaign or obama his campaign used it without her permission
2034008 the stakes couldnt be higher even the snopes anti rumor site acknowledges that obamas constitutional fitness to be president depends solely on his being born in the united states because his mother not yet 19 at the time of his birth would not have had a sufficient number of years as an adult citizen according to the laws prevailing at the time to pass on natural born citizenship automatically
2034009 there have been reports so far unconfirmed that obama was born outside the country either in kenya his presumed fathers native land or in canada the fact that the obama campaign has been touting as genuine a forgery since june 12 will likely increase pressure to not only account for the fake but produce a genuine paper birth certificate obama in his book dreams from my father specifically mentioned having such a document in his possession but it has not been submitted for public inspection or analysis if it in fact exists
2034010 if obama were born outside the united states one could argue that he would not meet the legal definition of natural born citizen because u
2034011 so she wouldnt have met the requirement of five years after the age of 16
2034012 natural born citizen under article ii section 1 of the constitution of the united states

2034031 we know we cant keep throwing rubbish into landfill my postbag is full of letters from people saying they want to recycle more but unless they know their efforts are making a real difference they wont keep trying
2034032 thats why statistics like these are so important the figures published today are provisional we will know the full picture by the end of the year but the early results show those efforts continue to be worthwhile local authorities and their residents are making good progress
2034033 we still have some way to go before we are performing at the level of some of our nearest neighbours in europe but we are catching them up and positive feedback like this should encourage all of us to keep up the effort to reduce and recycle our rubbish

2034114 but there werent too many options out there for that i enjoy going to the rink i enjoy being around the kids
2034115 physically i feel great but ive definitely changed my game
2034116 nowadays the kids are so fast you have to use your mind i think ive matured mentally from when i was younger you cant battle in front of the net anymore a lot of it is angles cutting people off from spots where they want to go it comes naturally being in all different situations in my career
2034117 if it doesnt happen i have lots of tapes of when i played in the nhl
2034118 its been a busy summer i didnt see this coming at the end but it all adds to it
2034119 it getting an ahl job is exciting theres a revival in the windy city and i like the depth in the organization
2034120 it all happened that quickly it was late in the summer as far as that goes i was surprised
2034121 theres definitely a learning curve when you change leagues the thing i like is that im surrounded by quality people when good people work hard good things happen
2034122 ive never head coached but you practice you prepare you grow ive been doing that for some time successful people want to go into a good situation you try to set the stage for the team to come into its own for me to be able to start my head coaching career this is the place i would have picked
2034123 ive never head coached but you practice you prepare you grow

2034125 i think whether i came back to the ahl and scored 30 or 40 goals next year it wouldnt have changed their mind toward me
2034126 i thought i achieved what i could in the ahl another season in the american league was too much i needed a new challenge
2034127 i can see from an outsiders point of view that i might be blocking off my chance in north america
2034128 im fairly confident if i wanted to i could step back into an american league job
2034129 i like the challenge of the pressure to me that was the attraction in wanting this job what i really like is their emphasis on winning here i have aspirations of coaching in the nhl this is a great preparation for coaching at that level
2034130 id prevent myself from thinking too deep on it i wasnt going to get my hopes up by any means
2034131 you are certainly in the shadow of what hes done and i dont mind that

2034133 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his life for the son of man is going to come in his fathers glory with his angels and then he will reward each person according to what he has done i tell you the truth some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
2034134 do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that you may prove what is the will of god what is good and acceptable and perfect

2034230 ethanol mandates have become a defining issue of the presidential campaign
2034231 will require 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels to be included in the fuel supply by 2022 and will increase that to at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol by 2030
2034232 obama will create a number of incentives for local communities to invest in their biofuels refineries
2034233 the policy favoring ethanol and other biofuels over food uses of grains and other crops acts as a regressive tax on the poor
2034234 rapid permanent increase in corn demand has directly sparked substantially higher corn prices to bid available supplies away from other uses primarily livestock feed higher corn prices in turn have forced soybean wheat and other grain prices higher in a bidding war for available crop land
2034235 could account for 25 to 50 percent of the corn price increase expected from 2006 07 to 2008 09
2034236 this increase was caused by a confluence of factors but the most important was the large increase in biofuels production in the u s and eu without the increase in biofuels global wheat and maize corn stocks would not have declined appreciably and price increases due to other factors would have been moderate
2034237 commonly used biofuels such as biodiesel from grapeseed and bioethanol from corn maize can contribute as much or more to global warming
2034238 relatively more nitrous oxide and other potent greenhouse gases in contrast the greenhouse gases released during the conventional gasoline fuel cycle contain relatively more of the less potent type namely carbon dioxide
2034239 biofuels from switchgrass if grown on u s corn lands increase emissions by 50 percent

2034300 no i never intended to come here i had laid out matters otherwise in my mind i thought i should contrive well for myself i thought my scheme good i intended to take effectual care but it came upon me unexpected i did not look for it at that time and in that manner it came as a thief death outwitted me gods wrath was too quick for me oh my cursed foolishness i was flattering myself and pleasing myself with vain dreams of what i would do hereafter and when i was saying peace and safety then sudden destruction came upon me

2034306 therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet i will not hear them
2034307 i will tread them in mine anger and will trample them in my fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and i will stain all my raiment
2034308 what if god willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
2034309 and the people shall be as the burnings of lime as thorns cut up shall they be burnt in the fire hear ye that are far off what i have done and ye that are near acknowledge my might the sinners in zion are afraid fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites
2034310 and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh

2034318 gunners secured milans piazza del duomo paratroops took up position outside st john lateran in rome and alpine mountain troops in feathered headgear helped police raid a drug pushers open air hangout in turin italy is hardly colombia there is not even a warning of imminent terrorist attack so why this air of national emergency the government of silvio berlusconi italys prime minister ordered the army on to the streets on august 4th to quell what it says is a crisis in law and order three thousand soldiers will be employed on public order duties most will be replacing police on guard at immigrant detention centres and near potential terrorist targets like embassies about 1 000 will patrol alongside the police the government says they will stay on the streets for at least six months a timely study by censis a research institute casts some doubt on the governments premise that crime is running out of control in 2006 there were fewer murders in italy than in germany france or britain one is more likely to be killed in brussels than in rome murder rates are not the same as crime rates however government figures show that the total number of offences has been rising by 6 7 annually what seems to have risen faster is public anxiety another survey for an insurance company foundation unipolis published on july 27th found that italians saw crime as the main cause of insecurity and almost half connected lawbreaking with foreigners the government attributes its election victory in april to mr berlusconis pledge to get tough on crime putting troops on the streets sends a message to his voters that it intends to deliver on that pledge anecdotal evidence suggests that most italians find the troops presence reassuring whether they will help stem crime is another matter general mario buscemi who led the last deployment of the army in italian towns to tackle the mafia in the 1990s recalled that he had 20 000 men just for sicily the current operation he said was substantially symbolic the soldiers do not have powers of arrest nor are they properly trained or equipped for policing operations one widely voiced fear is that the sight of troops could scare off tourists the mayor of rome gianni alemanno a member of mr berlusconis freedom people movement has fought a running battle to keep uniformed soldiers out of the city centre italy may not be colombia but it might start to look like it amid the melodrama including the emergency over the arrival of migrants on boats from north africa and the eviction of gypsies there is a nagging question why is a government so tough on crime so indulgent about corruption among mr berlusconis first acts in government were closing the office of the high commissioner against corruption and passing a law that means he himself will not have to answer to bribery charges
2034319 the italian media mogul and part time prime minister berlusconi has now deployed the army to bring security to the country only a short while ago parts of the italian constitution were stolen so that berlusconi was forced to make his own laws to prevent anything like that from happening again soldiers are now being deployed to protect among other things the cathedral in milan so far they have been successful because the building has not yet been stolen as is common at this time of year otherwise however the deployment has proved a failure in pisa berlusconis special forces were unable to prevent traffickers from dangerously tilting the tower things are particularly bad in pompeii despite heightened security criminal elements there have reduced the bathing resort to rubble and ashes and a gruesome sight welcomes visitors to rome where thieves have hardly left a stone standing in the forum
2034320 why is a government so tough on crime so indulgent about corruption

2034347 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time
2034348 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza

2034350 the best hospitals in the country have residents involved in patient care
2034351 is always committed to providing the highest quality most comprehensive patient care and its continuously looking at ways to improve that at all time
2034352 both the facts and the issue of liability were disputed in the case
2034353 one of the things that makes this case a little bit unique is that dr reust had contact with this patient before and when he saw the patient in the pre op holding area recognized this patient
2034354 there was a very obvious history of difficult airway management
2034355 all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2034356 hopefully mr higgins has the foresight to see that the region must develop a comprehensive public transportation system and this entail could involve the rebirth of the central terminal
2034357 we looked at a variety of factors if there were more calls for service arrest increase violent crime increase but theres no single thing that this points to
2034358 there are lots of possible explanations thats why it would be a benefit to know why this is taking place and if they should do some better training or have policies that limit the use of force
2034359 ms grants alleged prior actions are totally irrelevant to this suit
2034360 nascar must obey the law and should focus its full attention on improving the discriminatory and hostile work environment to which employees are subject
2034361 clearly these revelations show that there are always at least two sides to every story
2034362 we are confident that over the course of this process even more facts will come to light and justice will be served

2034364 she has been spotted in front of my home on several occasions she has contacted all of my family and friends attempting to make threats and slander my name she has also contacted my current girlfriend and i feel she is in jeopardy as well
2034365 despite this apparent smear campaign against mauricia grant nascar has not refuted one single claim ms grant has made about the discrimination and harassment she endured
2034366 instead nascar suspended two officials in the course of its interminable internal investigation and had previously fired an employee later named in the suit for an undisclosed reason

2034369 the iptv market is moving quickly to high definition service and were helping providers get there as fast as possible by eliminating serious pain points in the installation and upgrade process
2034370 we are the only wi fi company that has focused on the unique needs of service providers and it has paid off our carrier business continues to grow as providers focus on streamlining the last hundred feet of the iptv delivery infrastructure extending our iptv success with 802 11n is a natural next step and one that is greeted with great enthusiasm by providers everywhere
2034371 with high definition iptv content the need for a reliable distribution network in the home has never been more important
2034372 having now deployed the ruckus mediaflex in tens of thousands of subscriber homes over the last two years we have found it to be among the best performing and most reliable in home platforms we have ever worked with we are now extending this unique technology to new high definition iptv services with the new 802 11n mediaflex system
2034373 with the ruckus mediaflex 7000 our customers can self install the system in a matter of minutes where and when they desire with the assurance of high quality it also gives our subscribers greater flexibility while helping us to bring more users online faster at a lower overall deployment cost
2034374 iptv providers are pushing the envelope in terms of content and technology this includes re thinking how video is distributed in the home where ruckus is leading the charge with its mediaflex wireless adapters
2034375 we expect to see this market pick up dramatically in the next year or two and ruckus new product can have a positive impact on carriers roll outs

2034422 como siempre todos repudian y condenan y la prensa oficial desmiente que detr s de la violencia haya habido alguna causa sectaria o terrorista en otras ocasiones la excusa habitual es que el criminal era una persona mentalmente inestable y no comprend a lo que hac a
2034423 si seguimos lo que sucedi en todos estos casos es que los criminales desaparecen y no son llevados a juicio no se oye hablar m s de ellos

2034426 si bien creo firmemente que la mayor a de los musulmanes de egipto apoyan a sus hermanos coptos y condenan estos incidentes a la luz de la incitaci n de cl rigos musulmanes en los canales de televisi n musulmanes es necesario admitir que lamentablemente las cosas cambiaron con la sospechada colaboraci n del gobierno
2034427 lo que sucede es un intento de aterrorizar a los coptos de egipto y de obligarlos a emigrar o de convertirse al islam para protegerse a s mismos a sus familias y sus propiedades de confiscaciones propuestas en muchas publicaciones isl micas

2034442 the reason for doing this project now is because churches of all denominations not just the catholic diocese are downsizing and this art is in danger of being lost churches synagogues and other houses of worship are closing their art and artifacts are often being sold off to the highest bidder and taken out of this area when we lose our religious art we are losing a piece of our heritage and our history i dont think buffalo heritage should be a tchotchke on the wall of a bar in phoenix
2034443 the project we have laid out is a five to ten year endeavor so we are keeping our sights focused on that once we are done collecting the majority of the art available in buffalo however we see the potential to expand our scope and seek religious art from other areas of the country in addition we will have exhibit space in saint anns school for traveling exhibits such as the vatican artifacts that are currently in cleveland in the future traveling items like that should come to buffalo

2034447 i dont want to comment on that but what i know is the anglican communion surrounds the see of canterbury and the canterbury see is respected by all of us and we would like the anglican communion to continue
2034448 the archbishop of canterbury should continue calling the lambeth conference but let us go back to what it used to be
2034449 when you obey the scriptures you repent of your sins what is bringing problems is the interpretation of the scriptures
2034450 if we all obey the scriptures and what they tell us i know that inner oneness will make us have the outer form of the anglican communion that which we want
2034451 has been part of the history and of the present of some provinces member churches of the communion
2034452 nobody sanctions polygamy it should be one man one woman when it comes to homosexuality it is sinful just as polygamy is
2034453 the clear and consistent teaching of scripture and tradition must not be set aside and overturned as it has been on the basis of dubious and conflicting evidence from reason and experience
2034454 god made me this way therefore he must want me to be this way etc
2034455 another ploy by the nrc to present an image to us we are smarter than that arent we
2034456 she was absolutely furious when daniel confronted her and they had a full blown argument they were screaming at each other and the next thing she headbutted him
2034457 other family members ran over to break it off and she stormed off it turned from a nice family affair into a brawl between joss and her brother no one could believe it
2034458 you would think as the kids godmother shed be on time
2034459 as she recited the order of service she failed to read what she had been given it showed a lack of respect
2034460 the priest had to remind her of her responsibilities as a godparent it was embarrassing to see her mumble the wrong words
2034461 a couple of relatives were not happy and told her so afterwards but joss said she wouldnt take abuse of a bunch of old biddies
2034462 joss had been looking forward to the baptism no one seemed bothered she was a little late but a few people from daniels side said something

2034465 go around put up signs shake some hands see some of the important people in the village
2034466 the campaign is treating alaska as a key battleground state
2034467 its a tough state to move but were making a play
2034468 if theres any year where a democrat can win alaska this is the year
2034469 theres a sense of betrayal with mccain in the fact that he doesnt support it
2034470 theres the sense that hes not any better than a democrat
2034471 i think obamas message is similar to sarahs two years ago
2034472 people want to believe that these really complex public policy questions are going to be solved by what i call glittering generalities
2034473 weve always voted up here just nobodys paid much attention
2034474 i think what surprises me is the animosity or the rudeness if theyre republican they say im not even going to talk to you or they hang up
2034475 they really appreciate that people would come to your town and talk to you thats a big thing
2034476 arctic villages last reported gas price was about 10 a gallon and they live right next to anwr
2034477 obama has a lot of east coast liberal staffers in alaska
2034478 has a real grass roots effort alaskans talking to alaskans
2034479 i dont think the views or opinions of alaskans have changed and the views of the republican party still represent the views of most people
2034480 by all indications at the scene it was a homicide
2034481 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2034482 do you subscribe to my blog using an rss feed

2034488 i think i have to step it up tonight but it was the first game at this level so its understandable but i really need to step up a bit and show everyone that i can play hockey
2034489 it doesnt matter to me if i go first or second or 10th or 30th its a great honor to be picked first and my goal is to be no 1 but if john tavares goes first its good for him i dont see him as a rival
2034490 i just need to play my game and people can say what they want
2034491 i just need to play my game and then it is up to the rest of the world to see if i go first or last to me it doesnt matter to me it is very important to have a good season hopefully then i will get to the top but for me it is all about showing the club that will eventually take you in the draft that you really want to play in the nhl
2034492 its my goal to play in the nhl as soon as possible
2034493 well see how it goes but hopefully i will have a good season here and go to the nhl as soon as possible
2034494 you try not to worry about who you are out against out there but obviously he is a guy that i played against a little bit internationally and have heard a lot about him
2034495 hes a guy that plays huge out there good skills skates really well for a big man
2034496 the way he plays out there he looks like a veteran hes really poised watching sweden last year he was already one of their best players he plays in the swedish elite league too so he gets a good test there
2034497 he plays in the elite league and gets a lot of minutes hes got it all as a hockey player i think this is one of his first times on the ice this year and when you have that big body like him it takes a while to get it going i think hes going to be even better as we go forward
2034498 it gets as many hands on it as soon as possible
2034499 through the team we can get information in two hours that otherwise would take officers two days its designed to handle an influx of information

2034517 however in an exchange of letters with an evangelical christian written eight years ago when he was archbishop of wales he described his belief that biblical passages criticising homosexual sex were not aimed at people who were gay by nature he argued that scriptural prohibitions were addressed to heterosexuals looking for sexual variety he wrote i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness dr williams described his view as his definitive conclusion reached after 20 years of study and prayer he drew a distinction between his own beliefs as a theologian and his position as a church leader for which he had to take account of the traditionalist view
2034518 so russell is writing a liturgy for homosexual marriage in violation of the moratoria
2034519 such suspicious comments do not at all help build trust among states of the region they can only stoke conflicts and drag the region into a cycle of dangerous crises
2034520 soon another crisis will grip the persian gulf area and that is the legitimacy crisis of the monarchies and traditional systems in the region
2034521 the next crisis predicted to cover mainly the persian gulf is the crisis of legitimacy of the monarchies and traditional systems which considering current circumstances cannot go on living
2034522 those who believe that the present circumstances enable them to expand and exercise control at the expense of others interests are mistaken
2034523 are very disappointed by and deeply concerned at such irresponsible remarks and they expect an immediate clarification from iran of its deputy foreign ministers statement
2034524 say sorry for what man have i like murdered someone have i
2034525 im not sorry for sticking up for what i believe in for standing up for myself for standing up for fellow players
2034526 im just a bit hurt that some of the players have come out and bagged me straight away without knowing the facts
2034527 i thought with them knowing the kind of bloke i was there would have been a legitimate reason for me doing what ive done
2034528 those players that have stood up and hammered me straight away probably werent my friends in the first place
2034529 but to those boys that support me they know that if they were in my shoes id back them 100 per cent no matter what
2034530 i never like seeing my close mates losing like that but in the bigger picture these boys know that what ive done is not just about me
2034531 its about them boys about the young boys coming through getting a better go getting a better deal out of things
2034532 im one of those young kids that used to love watching everything about rugby league
2034533 but then when i go to the club now being at the club and seeing whats going on behind the scenes i see that it is just a business
2034534 they dont care about me they treat us like cattle
2034535 what i have done it has shown that it is just not about me
2034536 on an average the green buildings programme aims to achieve reduction of energy consumption by 25 on all new buildings built with the traditional building materials
2034537 the epbd lays down guidelines to realize energy saving potential in the buildings sector which is estimated at 28 thereby reducing the total energy use across the eu by 11 hence it is the strong catalyst for the growth of this market
2034538 it is peremptory for all the eu states to follow the epbd legislation so that a uniform system can be developed to classify buildings as green across the eu however there is still no defined paradigm to assess and classify buildings as green buildings in the eu as compared to the us defining the market size individually and collectively in the eu states is untenable in these circumstances

2034585 steenkamp is the type of player that gets the things going and he arrived here in a very positive frame of mind he is eager to fight his way back into the springbok team
2034586 one of the better things about hockey players in general is that we leave it on the ice we dont hold grudges when you get to a new team guys are always welcoming and brought into the family
2034587 if anything its going to be exciting to get a chance to maybe play with him on the same line or just play with him on the same team its going to be great you almost have more respect for guys youve battled whether it is playing or actual fights or even in the heat of the moment with a guy like steve ott its certainly going to be a lot of fun playing with them it will probably bring my fighting majors down a little
2034588 the team im coming to is certainly a better team that i formerly i played on i think this is going to be a better opportunity as far as winning goes so thats obviously a big attraction secondly the relationship ive had with brett hull since i played with him in detroit and now his move to management putting the faith in me that i am going to be able to come in and help this team win i think those were the two biggest things
2034589 im coming to a team thats happy to have me and expects a lot out of me i think im ready to take it to the next level i think i showed a little of bit that in new york now ive got four years to really try to showcase that
2034590 watching the playoffs last year and watching the series against detroit i think if you throw me in the lineup in that series it is definitely going to make a difference i think the last two years have proved how i play in the playoffs and thats the time of the year thats the most fun to play and the most exciting time
2034591 detroits a great team and there are a lot of great teams in the west but certainly the physical presence and just that extra kick start there are a lot of things that i am going to bring to the table that are going to help our chances against a team like detroit or san jose or anaheim or whoever the team we are going to be playing in the semifinals
2034592 as far as watching a guy play watching a guy being able to read the game and be a big time player that was certainly beneficial hes a great guy and one of the greatest players of all time

2034596 to be so well prepared that direct warfare becomes unnecessary
2034597 its war by other means and the chinese have been very bright
2034598 i have no doubt that china will get more gold medals than us but they wont do it by going head to head with the us they understand that they cant compete directly
2034599 chinas way of training athletes has its advantages ninety five per cent of national champions emerge through this system
2034600 no athlete would say i get too many gold medals im tired of winning medals
2034601 if you are an athlete you must always want to win the gold medal to prove your strength
2034602 at athens it was a big surprise that china got more medals than russia we cannot surpass america in gold medals this time because we do not have the same economic power
2034603 there are academics who argue for reform the reason it hasnt happened yet is the olympics if china does well reform is likely to be delayed

2034606 sheridan has kind of held itself out as the gateway to the fox river dells area there
2034607 im not saying sheridan is penniless and cant afford anything
2034608 im not sure that sheridan has significant enough cash flow to do much with the property
2034609 i think any time youve got friends of yours who are being held incommunicado against their will in a communist country you have to have some level of concern
2034610 they wont let us in but we have a group that will cross in another spot
2034611 theyll have to strip search everyone who crosses that border or they wont know who we are theyll have to see the wbc westboro baptist church tattoo on our butts
2034612 we want to protect the family so they dont come out of the church service and see people shouting obscenities
2034613 ive never met the mclean family ive just been moved by the whole story
2034614 these people are callous vicious and shouldnt be let into our country
2034615 we have freedom of speech but they are inciting hate
2034616 these people from westboro are almost as crazy as the murderer
2034617 if they are here to disrupt the social order that constitutes grounds to deny them entry there is no redeeming virtue in the message they are bringing
2034618 in the opinion of his office coming up here with the message theyre articulating constitutes hate speech
2034619 the world is full of light and life and the true crime is not to be interested in it
2034620 the momentum and intensity of the campaign builds almost every day as you approach the election
2034621 you spend a lot of time planning for the events you know about and you spend a lot of time reacting to the events that just happen
2034622 the battle is the independent vote and they dont make up their minds until late
2034623 the olympics generally suck all the air out of a political campaign
2034624 as far as summer viewership and reach and exposure and the fact that not just sports fans watch the olympics its a very good vehicle for national politics
2034625 i dont think you can stick your john mccain is wrong spot on the olympics coverage it has to be in line with the goals of the event which would mean positive uplifting patriotism kind of messages
2034626 it would prove mccain right and obama wrong on the surge
2034627 but americans always care more about the future than the past
2034628 it makes it harder to criticize his plan as being strategically imprudent it allows him to essentially turn the issues back toward domestic policy and the economy
2034629 it will certainly be over 30 and it could be as high as a third
2034630 everybody recognizes that its changed the game a little bit in terms of how you do your get out the vote
2034631 voters try to use debates to gain information about people they dont know very well
2034632 to some extent that applies to john mccain i think theres still a lot people dont know about him but the obvious person is barack obama
2034633 wanted a change but they were worried whether reagan was the right guy
2034634 you do think about and preliminarily plan for how the campaign would react to one of those big top tier events
2034635 we are at a point where people are really hurting in their pocketbooks

2034645 the things hoover believed in efficiency enterprise opportunity individualism substantial laissez faire personal success material welfare were all in the dominant american tradition the ideas he represented ideas that to so many people made him seem hateful or ridiculous after 1929 were precisely the same ideas that in the remotest past of the nineteenth century and the more immediate past of the new era had had an almost irresistible lure for the majority of americans

2034647 during the past ten years a nation of 120 000 000 people has been led by the republican leaders to erect an impregnable barbed wire entanglement around its borders through the instrumentality of tariffs which has isolated us from all the other human beings in all the rest of the round world
2034648 go into the home of the business man he knows what the tariff has done for him go into the home of the factory worker
2034649 my program of which i can only touch on these points is based upon this simple moral principle the welfare and the soundness of a nation depend first upon what the great mass of the people wish and need and second whether or not they are getting it

2034653 i want the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow to be built not in japan not in china but here in the united states of america here in michigan
2034654 its so disappointing to see obama now say he would consider expanding offshore drilling even though he knows it is not a real solution to the energy crisis

2034669 its a once in a lifetime project i did this alone no help i have found with other things in the past that if you have help the help often does not get it right and you have to do it over 95 of the time plus i like to work alone all parts are scratch built cept tires rims brakes engine etc meaning all bodyparts brackets just about everything external on the car
2034670 it feels like climbing mt everest half way up you start to wounder if this wasnt a big mistake then you realize that you are too far to quit in fact quitting is now not an option because if you do quit you will have set a precedence about yourself and all up to this point will become a huge disaster you get a little farther now you look down and view is breathtaking so on an emotional level this car is giving back to you what you gave to it it makes you start to think that if you can do this then you can make anything happen if you really want to it revitalizes faith in yourself this is not supposed to be possible not at this social economic level

2034676 relocation is just another word for destruction this is a thriving community which has received help from many different government bodies and there is no reason or justification to destroy it the fact that peace now went to the supreme court against us first of all we have plenty of legal claims as well involving forging of documents and our documentation of our purchase of properties here yet the supreme court dismissed us
2034677 that it is quite unheard of that peace now went to the supreme court with this property disputes are supposed to be judged in local courts not the countrys highest it must be that peace now knew what it was doing when it went directly to the supreme court and this was proven correct

2034753 if you look up tea in the first cookery book that comes to hand you will probably find that it is unmentioned or at most you will find a few lines of sketchy instructions which give no ruling on several of the most important points this is curious not only because tea is one of the main stays of civilization in this country as well as in eire australia and new zealand but because the best manner of making it is the subject of violent disputes when i look through my own recipe for the perfect cup of tea i find no fewer than eleven outstanding points on perhaps two of them there would be pretty general agreement but at least four others are acutely controversial here are my own eleven rules every one of which i regard as golden first of all one should use indian or ceylonese tea china tea has virtues which are not to be despised nowadays it is economical and one can drink it without milk but there is not much stimulation in it one does not feel wiser braver or more optimistic after drinking it anyone who has used that comforting phrase a nice cup of tea invariably means indian tea secondly tea should be made in small quantities that is in a teapot tea out of an urn is always tasteless while army tea made in a cauldron tastes of grease and whitewash the teapot should be made of china or earthenware silver or britanniaware teapots produce inferior tea and enamel pots are worse though curiously enough a pewter teapot a rarity nowadays is not so bad thirdly the pot should be warmed beforehand this is better done by placing it on the hob than by the usual method of swilling it out with hot water fourthly the tea should be strong for a pot holding a quart if you are going to fill it nearly to the brim six heaped teaspoons would be about right in a time of rationing this is not an idea that can be realized on every day of the week but i maintain that one strong cup of tea is better than twenty weak ones all true tea lovers not only like their tea strong but like it a little stronger with each year that passes a fact which is recognized in the extra ration issued to old age pensioners fifthly the tea should be put straight into the pot no strainers muslin bags or other devices to imprison the tea in some countries teapots are fitted with little dangling baskets under the spout to catch the stray leaves which are supposed to be harmful actually one can swallow tea leaves in considerable quantities without ill effect and if the tea is not loose in the pot it never infuses properly sixthly one should take the teapot to the kettle and not the other way about the water should be actually boiling at the moment of impact which means that one should keep it on the flame while one pours some people add that one should only use water that has been freshly brought to the boil but i have never noticed that it makes any difference seventhly after making the tea one should stir it or better give the pot a good shake afterwards allowing the leaves to settle eighthly one should drink out of a good breakfast cup that is the cylindrical type of cup not the flat shallow type the breakfast cup holds more and with the other kind ones tea is always half cold before one has well started on it ninthly one should pour the cream off the milk before using it for tea milk that is too creamy always gives tea a sickly taste tenthly one should pour tea into the cup first this is one of the most controversial points of all indeed in every family in britain there are probably two schools of thought on the subject the milk first school can bring forward some fairly strong arguments but i maintain that my own argument is unanswerable this is that by putting the tea in first and stirring as one pours one can exactly regulate the amount of milk whereas one is liable to put in too much milk if one does it the other way round lastly tea unless one is drinking it in the russian style should be drunk without sugar i know very well that i am in a minority here but still how can you call yourself a true tealover if you destroy the flavour of your tea by putting sugar in it it would be equally reasonable to put in pepper or salt tea is meant to be bitter just as beer is meant to be bitter if you sweeten it you are no longer tasting the tea you are merely tasting the sugar you could make a very similar drink by dissolving sugar in plain hot water some people would answer that they dont like tea in itself that they only drink it in order to be warmed and stimulated and they need sugar to take the taste away to those misguided people i would say try drinking tea without sugar for say a fortnight and it is very unlikely that you will ever want to ruin your tea by sweetening it again these are not the only controversial points to arise in connexion with tea drinking but they are sufficient to show how subtilized the whole business has become there is also the mysterious social etiquette surrounding the teapot why is it considered vulgar to drink out of your saucer for instance and much might be written about the subsidiary uses of tealeaves such as telling fortunes predicting the arrival of visitors feeding rabbits healing burns and sweeping the carpet it is worth paying attention to such details as warming the pot and using water that is really boiling so as to make quite sure of wringing out of ones ration the twenty good strong cups of that two ounces properly handled ought to represent

2034775 what happens on a trip like this is i think you deepen your understandings
2034776 there was a lot of confirmation of my strategies that we need to get more troops into afghanistan and that the iraqis are willing to take more responsibility that iran is a grave threat
2034777 your flag indicates that you are if so i was wondering do you think the people of your country believed hitler was a threat
2034778 while going through your country hilter was rounding jews up by the truck loads so he could ship them off and kill them
2034779 now you actually have the mindset which allows you to come to the defense of a leader who says it never took place
2034780 what are you thinking as your ancestors were put through hell just for living in the way of hitler the jews are sitting very close to a country who has a leader that actually said israel should be wiped off the map
2034781 has the hate america crowd in europe gotten so blinded by this hate that you are now actually taken up for people like the iranian leaders
2034782 but i am not willing to allow my life to be placed in jeopardy while we wait on them to step up and take over and their current leaders develop a bomb which when used will require the u s to support israel in some way
2034783 i would also suggest that the chance for civilized debate is very slim considering the man you wish to have the exchange with believes its ok to kill people for being homosexual
2034784 why is it that europe and liberal minded folks cannot see that being kind to people with no heart doesnt work
2034785 one more question why if calling iran a threat is counter to good talks do europeans find it so easy to tell americans how cruel we are and how we are responsible for the worlds problems especially when the u s has supported every military action the european nations have taken against those they consider a threat
2034786 you know what the difference is between my country then and israel now we werent doing anything wrong when hitler attacked israel commits crimes against humanity on a daily basis in know that you dont like to hear this but its true the other countrys in the middle east including iran are pissed off for a reason thats a big difference
2034787 the islamic resistance movement believes that the land of palestine is an islamic waqf consecrated for future moslem generations until judgement day
2034788 there is no solution for the palestinian question except through jihad initiatives proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors
2034789 after palestine the zionists aspire to expand from the nile to the euphrates
2034790 iran has a reason to feel treathened dont you think no matter wat they do they will always be considered as a threat offcourse this unless do everything that the us tells them to do
2034791 take a look through the eyes of an iranian dont you think they feel the same they dont want to see an invasion in their country by the us and israel so they support the leader that is most anti american israeli
2034792 i dont want to sound anti american beceause i see your country as a friend but you guys think its okay to kill people in other countrys simply beceause you dont feel safe
2034793 their is a distinct difference betweeen how europe sees the us and how its sees iran the us is and will always be a friend but this friend has always been a little much a warfanatic but it has erupted under the neoconservative government for example the whole country want bill clinton impeached for lying about a blowjob but when bush lies about a war he can stay in office america is a friend but that doenst mean we shouldt be critical of eachothers behaviour
2034794 iran will never attack israel beceause then the whole world including europe will bomb the out of them not that israel need our support beceause their military is far more large an advanced then irans military
2034795 he said the point of the trip was to strengthen partnerships overseas

2034828 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover that they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury from that moment on the majority always votes for the candidates who promise the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that every democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy which is always followed by a dictatorship
2034829 we have also suffered deeply in the aftermath of tok s abrogation of the project
2034830 we have incurred a deficit of ytl 15 million we are in desperate need of cash hence we plan to sell some of our projects in bodrum located in mu la below their real value in order to be able to pay back our customers
2034831 we have been negotiating with two funds one from england and the other from switzerland for the mass selling of some of our projects
2034832 we reached an outsourcing agreement with a sales office and the representatives from this office collected ytl 3 000 from our customers as the cost of their title deeds on the basis of this agreement however they later embezzled this money
2034833 we filed a lawsuit against this company in order to be able to get this money back we called our customers and sought to determine the ones who had been wronged
2034834 however we had difficulty in this investigation because we did not have a list of the ones who paid the charges of their title deeds we gave written certification to those who had receipts and we have been trying to pay them back their money
2034835 all these problems coupled with the stagnation in the real estate sector have left us in dire straits and we are trying to sell some of our projects in bodrum and mu la at prices below their value in order to overcome this adverse situation
2034836 we have been carrying out negotiations with two funds for the mass sale of some of our projects we are selling some of the projects for which we previously demanded 250 000 at ytl 200 000 in exclusive dealings

2034889 this ruling rightly recognizes that parents have an intrinsic right to control their childrens education as well as safeguard their mental and physical well being
2034890 on the international stage many of us have studied how the mere presence of black faces in high places doesnt necessarily translate to real on the ground positive changes see kenya see myanmar burma see liberia i asked a question in regards to an obama presidency some time ago what happens when obama signs the papers that sells the arms to israel that ends up killing palestinians or maybe some iranians how would that reflect on black americans that is a serious question because and obama presidency may mark the first time in history that black americans as a group are directly complicit in the oppression of another group that to me is a very scary thought
2034891 the kicker was that you cant use your points until it gets to 2500 points

2034899 he had to catch a train from another location to st marys station and was walking on the road about 400 metres from the railway station when it happened
2034900 he noticed a van coming up from behind him and has not taken much notice of it and then someone has tried to grab him from behind and hit him
2034901 with all they have to do this is on their list but they have to get some pretty big poles out there to replace them
2034902 i know there are some pretty irate citizens out there about that road and were not very pleased about it either but at the same time try to keep in mind the extent that commonwealth edisons system has been damaged in northeastern illinois and all they have to do

2034906 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
2034907 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
2034908 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
2034909 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
2034910 the price of such hotels is already 4 to 5 pounds they think that extra spending of tourists will bring money there are hotels like this in ku adas they hope that tourists will spend money for extras like alcohol such tourists who prefer cheap tours will leave 8 to 10 pounds at most but if they sell rooms in normal prices high quality tourists will come and they will earn money
2034911 because of price policy of those tour operators five star hotels have to cut their prices five star hotels are marketed at the price of two star hotels thats why two and three star hotels cannot be sold even hotel owners dont know what to do there are campaigns offering three week stays at the price of a two week stay etc thats why no one cares about two to three star facilities big hotels try to keep themselves alive no one can do anything about it
2034912 apart hotels do the same thing owners accept costumers for 2 to 3 to 4 pounds to keep the empty facility alive problem occurs because our tourism policy cannot support them
2034913 this is an important part of the future of general motors no question about it
2034914 i think we are really at a tipping point for our industry weve been for almost 100 years pretty much fully reliant on petroleum
2034915 and i think its clear both the way things are today and the ways theyre going to go in the future that were going to have to develop alternative sources of power for vehicles and we think electricity is going to be a winner long term
2034916 whether its nuclear whether its solar there is no question that they are thinking about the best way to add capacity that we might generate through this sort of vehicle
2034917 and so our job is to offer a future vision for our industry where we can help address the issue and take concerns off the table rather than contribute to them
2034918 we are not only working on new technologies that will break through and lead us in the future but we have to improve our current product portfolio quite a bit
2034919 i think with this technology we are going to lead the world and our desire is to lead the whole industry to the next plateau
2034920 i think its true to say that some consumers will adapt more slowly than others but from the reaction ive seen amp i dont think we will have any problem

2034968 for the most part these social networking sites should be viewed as complementary to your online presence think of it as a nice to have not a must have

2034970 sites such as linkedin can be helpful in connecting with people you want to meet for one reason or another twitter and facebook can be helpful when youre trying to notify a group of people about something you want to promote or about a happening of some kind
2034971 the viral nature of social networking is quite extraordinary and something that can garner a lot of attention to your efforts in a hurry
2034972 the site requires some r sum creation then offers the opportunity to link in to other like minded professionals when used selectively it can be a very powerful tool for identifying new business partners new employees or simply building your personal or business presence

2035020 im just glad to be blessed with the opportunity to be gods instrument that he plays his beautiful music through and i just cant wait for november 8
2035021 i just had a palpable emotional reaction to the script
2035022 its got a very mythic fairytale kind of feel and that of course has a connection to not only my last film but a lot of short films ive done
2035023 year of the fish which opens later this year was set in chinatown
2035024 and i think they thought if i could do chinatown i could do jackson heights the neighborhood will be a character and the sense of family being a unique sort of pressure plays very much in the story
2035025 often the actor who has developed the project for themselves isnt talented enough to get starring roles but i was thrilled to find the script beautifully written and aasif is an extraordinary actor
2035026 i wanted to up the stakes i had done a short with child actors i wanted to write meaty parts for adult actors
2035027 shooting it this way we think will help the actors build their emotional arcs through the film
2035028 apparently were shooting on the set that was yodas house in empire
2035029 a point has to come where the writer director has to transfer ownership of the characters to the actors and trust them to follow the intentions of the story
2035030 we can throw the dialogue away because i want them to know the characters even more than i do
2035031 but after talking to marion she convinced me that even if we didnt want to use the dialogue it would be helpful to her to figure out the character but im fortunate to work with very talented people and i have a certain confidence that when we shoot im going to get more truthful and natural stuff from them than anything i would have conjured on my own
2035032 the original idea was the events of these stories were happening concurrently
2035033 but when we shot heart of now we had this new understanding and figured white knuckles happens a few months after the events in heart of now
2035034 we want to retain ownership of our films so were intent on being a part of the emerging online distribution models
2035035 kesey was flush with money from one flew over the cuckoos nest
2035036 and paid for all the film and rental of the cameras they had two or three and they had a huge sound system and were playing music on top of the bus they thought they were making an organic movie i thought wouldnt it be fun to explore that trip in detail but the key was having this footage
2035037 youve got coaltrane and youve also got roger miller singing king of the road the beatles are just coming to america things havent blown up yet its the fuse not the explosion
2035038 it will be ready when its ready but the bus is rolling
2035039 if it wasnt for paris je taime none of the agents would have taken a listen
2035040 this is important when you are trying to do a film like this that breaks the mold and is creatively challenging
2035041 you want to tell everyone at the beginning to leave their egos at the door but thats easier said than done
2035042 its the question of a really good production team and i would venture to say we had a much more cohesive and experienced production team on this
2035043 it stars shia labeouf and julie christie its period and is hauntingly beautiful
2035044 that being said i think each film has its own unique quality and reflects the individual directors vision
2035045 only japanese people work in our kitchen they come for a few years and then go back this way there is little western influence it keeps yamazato absolutely authentic

2035052 a lot of novices rookies were drawn in by the prices they saw but they realized especially with these lower priced houses and rents that management fees ate up whatever profits there were

2035058 whites stunning second crime novel to feature ex cop and ex pi jackson donne fulfills the promise of his debut
2035059 intricate plotting and nonstop action make this a nail biting read from start to finish white is a writer to watch
2035060 scenes of donnes mothers decline however are knowing and movingly written and the gritty new jersey locale seems an ideal setting for portraying the evil that men do
2035061 white has learned early the art of the hard boiled
2035062 white has created an appealing character in donne and the plot flies between the events in the 1940s and explosions kidnappings and murders in the present
2035063 an engrossing evocative debut novel that will grab most readers from its opening sentences fans of hard hitting uncompromising private investigators will hope that donne ditches his college dreams and continues to pound the pavement
2035064 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
2035065 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel
2035066 its the great american private eye novel reborn for the 21st century with a fast moving spare style that punches you in the gut at the same time it squeezes your heart
2035067 when one man dies barrels straight out of the old school and swerves onto the highway that will take detective fiction where its going next dave white has one hand on the wheel the other on the gear shift and his foot on the floor
2035068 fast and funny with plenty of classic action but a setting and character that are entirely new dave white is creating a winner with jackson donne
2035069 when one man dies heralds the introduction of two astonishing new figures in the crime fiction world new jersey pi jackson donne whose emotional journey will break your heart and author dave white whose voice has the confidence and assurance many more established writers would kill for

2035092 we invited 45 players in we have been trying to get a balance between the provincial pre season its slightly shorter this year and striking that balance between the rugby and the conditioning work
2035093 the aims rather than giving you the outlandish ones of trying to enjoy myself hoping that we do as well as we possibly can can be broken down to results and performance
2035094 november is more important than it has ever been this year theres irb ranking points available and wherever we stand on december 1 is going to have an effect on the draw for the next world cup it has a three year effect how we go in the next three matches

2035273 we are confident that when we present all the facts the public for the first time will get a true picture of what actually happened and remy will be vindicated
2035274 he who is not contented with what he has would not be contented with what he would like to have
2035275 in the last years of his long and stubbornly contrarian life alexander solzhenitsyn finally found a political system he could embrace vladimir putins russia
2035276 putin inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralized people
2035277 and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration these efforts were not noticed nor appreciated immediately in any case one is hard pressed to find examples in history when steps by one country to restore its strength were met favorably by other governments
2035278 we are proud that alexander solzhenitsyn was our compatriot and contemporary
2035279 we will remember him as a strong courageous person with a great sense of dignity his activities as a writer and public figure his entire long thorny life journey will remain for us a model of true devotion selfless service to the people motherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humaneness
2035280 worked incessantly to form moral and spiritual ideals seeing them as an extremely important foundation supporting the state and society and fought for their triumph
2035281 but he spent his last day wonderfully he worked all day writing at his desk recently he told me that now he only worked eight hours a day when before he used to work for 16 he thought it was very little seven or eight hours and he complained about it
2035282 severe trials befell solzhenitsyn as they did millions of other people in this country
2035283 he was among the first to speak out about the brutality of stalins regime and about the people who experienced it but were not crushed to his last days he continued to work for russia to get a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country not just break away from the totalitarian past we owe him much
2035284 a mass multibillion dollar fire sale of the national patrimony wanting to gain the support of regional leaders yeltsin called directly for separatism and passed laws that encouraged and empowered the collapse of the russian state this of course deprived russia of its historical role for which it had worked so hard and lowered its standing in the international community all this met with even more hearty western applause
2035285 when solzhenitsyn first appeared on the soviet literary scene it was the greatest news
2035286 no one wrote about stalins camps as he did his impact was sensational and i was one of his admirers
2035287 for me a great writer must defend mankind and he loses his reputation if he becomes too close to the highest power
2035288 solzhenitsyn said many things i radically disagree with including his comments on putin
2035289 but the meaning of solzhenitsyn is not lessened because of this
2035290 the man who restored the country the man who saved the nation and didnt allow it to turn back to totalitarianism
2035291 of course russia is not a democratic country yet it is just starting to build democracy
2035292 it is all too easy to take russia to task with a long list of omissions violations and mistakes but did not russia clearly and unambiguously stretch its helping hand to the west after 9 11 only a psychological shortcoming or else a disastrous shortsightedness can explain the wests irrational refusal of this hand
2035293 i for my part drew the writers attention to the fact that some steps we are taking today are largely in accordance with what solzhenitsyn once wrote about
2035294 what cracker is this same that deafs our ears with this abundance of superfluous breath

2035304 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
2035305 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel

2035311 i think in the past he had been opposed to these kinds of ward connerly referenda or initiatives as divisive and i think hes right

2035325 there are not many gloucester players who have ever been granted a testimonial year so to follow players like andy deacon and mark cornwell with this honour means a huge amount to me
2035326 this is just something very special and to be only the third player to ever receive one is a tremendous honour

2035411 my compliments on a superb and extremely helpful web site to the best of my knowledge its only one of its kind that provides so much detailed information in one place for the clean air conscious traveler as a business editor for a florida daily newspaper i know quality of life and particularly air quality are critical factors for many high tech companies when they are scouting for locations to expand or start a new enterprise your site and links provide an outstanding portal into this expanding field of clean air consciousness keep up the excellent work
2035412 your site is outstanding and very informative i live here in la and have been hoping to one day find an area with cleaner air in particular i had been looking at bellingham and enjoyed reading of your experiences there your writing style is excellent and a real pleasure to read of the many sites out there a truly useful site looking forward to reading about your next journey towards finding a clean air location
2035413 i came across your blog and found your site to be a very interesting read thanks for what you do to bring clean healthy air issues to light

2035422 animals are not exactly like humans but humans are animals we are more alike than different and if you truly look at the nature of so called human atrocities their root is in the human atrocities we have visited on animals and first in our brains the divisions weve created between ourselves and each other and animals it would make sense to me to deal with the divisions break down the false divisions between animal that rather than reinforce and solidify them perhaps that could help us break down the divisions between human beings

2035545 well the fbis been here for about a year we knew that they have been here for a long time i would see them all the time so i mean we werent sure exactly what was happening but we knew there was something going on on our street but we never suspected bruce i mean we never you know and i still dont you know look at him unfavorably or anything because he was a really decent guy

2035547 the horse and pony we impounded on july 11 are still in our custody
2035548 we are still awaiting a decision from the kankakee countys states attorneys office regarding charges against the owner
2035549 im not sure if its due to the economy or not but we are seeing more abused horses this year
2035550 animals are suffering as a result of their owners neglect
2035551 i know times are tough but you just dont let an animal suffer
2035552 all of the cases were from the eastern part of the county
2035553 at a pembroke township location where we had previously notified the landowner of problems
2035554 one of the horses had its hoof caught in fencing and was down on the ground
2035555 we released the horses hoof but it remained down we contacted the owner who did not live on the property and said the violations had to be corrected
2035556 each time we go out and give a notice of violations we have to give the owners the opportunity to correct the problems we want those owners to take responsibility for their animals and make corrections
2035557 youd expect people would be diligent for at least 30 days
2035558 we offered the horse food and water and put up a lean to shelter hoping to give it a chance to rebound
2035559 the next day we had to make the decision to have the mare put down
2035560 a person had caught the horse and described it as emaciated
2035561 it was a young horse but it was in horribly bad condition it had sores all over and it was just skin and bones
2035562 last saturday we got yet another call about another horse running loose that horse is also extremely thin and has no known owner
2035563 we just dont have the resources to take on this kind of responsibility it is frustrating because we have all these animals to take care of in addition to all the dog and cat and other animal calls that we get every day
2035564 if the columbia administrators want to win the hearts and minds of people they can start by not allowing the colt railroad to run the paris road track during the peak of morning rush hour its hard enough battling the influx of rush hour traffic and weather without adding a freight train to the mix
2035565 id like to comment on the situation of the man attempting suicide on the bridge the other day before this town shows its true political correctness colors maybe we should keep in mind the fact that this guy is a convicted criminal he had threatened the cops before resisted arrest and he was trying to kill himself shutting down the highway for over an hour causing risk to the officers and the people in the cars below
2035566 i have been reading the paper for over 40 to 50 years i have voted both republican and democrat and i think the monday editorial page hank waters comments about the republican candidates are absolutely garbage how in the world can he pick out a party democrat or republican and be so insensitive and so rude and so wrong
2035567 im calling about the recent issue of columbia home magazine i noticed an ad for the grand cru restaurant after the full page ad was a story on a cigar smoking class for women throughout the story they had pictures of woman learning the proper etiquette to preparing and smoking a cigar this was all done within one of the restaurants many rooms my point is that they were smoking inside an established restaurant i thought we passed a law making it illegal to smoke in columbia businesses and the last time i checked the grand cru restaurant is still inside the city limits another point is i thought that the magazine was to promote a well being for woman and smoking is smoking no matter how or where
2035568 id just like to comment to the guy that calls in as the missouri traveler i went to the lake this morning and was coming back and had to get gas and i thought well ill fill up in jeff city so it will be cheaper and it was 3 75 when i arrived in columbia it was 3 69
2035569 i am disappointed every time i read the tribunes view it seems very politically laden and hes not bashful about using his local power and clout to share his economic and political views such as who he believes should have the next position or who should win the next election and his feelings on political parties such as mondays article about whats wrong with todays gop im an independent but as a reader of the publisher and a reader of the tribune and citizen of columbia i guess im ashamed to read that and see that the editor feels he should use the pages to voice his political opinions when the paper should be something that sticks to the facts

2035733 in general the event driven and around the clock nature of the olympics make the next few weeks a really important testing ground for the state of mobile media
2035734 consumers are especially looking forward to the high profile short events such as track and field and gymnastics on their phone
2035735 longer team sports such as soccer and volleyball are less conducive to mobile viewing but mobile users will still follow the scores closely on their devices
2035736 a lot of subscribers tell us they want the ability to follow along on their phone and nbc has done a great job partnering with leading carriers to make it possible
2035737 but well see whether promotion has been sufficient to drive subscribers to actually tune in
2035738 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
2035739 listen you folks are smart enough especially being in your industry to know what havoc tire pressure can wreak on a countrys economy here are the facts america is currently producing around 8 million barrels of oil per day if we drill offshore and in alaska we could add a couple of million barrels per day but more domestically produced oil is not the answer to energy independence according to mine and michelles calculations if every car in america had its tires inflated to the correct pressure we could actually produce 7 million less barrels of oil per day and still get by on the same consumption but only if tires are inflated to the proper psi you folks are smart enough to know that since the 1960s the population has increased more than 60 percent automobile ownership and usage has increased more than 100 percent now the conservatives and economists want you to believe that our increased oil and gas consumption is because of triple the cars on the road and the mileage driven each year but they are wrong in the 1960s all gas stations were full service when you pulled in for gas they filled your car checked you tires and checked your oil very simple really i propose to you folks that if i am elected every man women and child will have access to a tire gauge and free compressed air we will make big oil pay by forcing them to convert all their gas stations back to full service yet keep the price of a gallon of gas the same i also propose that all law enforcement agencies around the country when an automobile is pulled over they will also along with checking for warrants and such the officer will be mandated to check the tire pressure and a heavy fine will be accessed for low pressure

2035829 the bible does not address the matter of appropriate behaviour for those who are for whatever reason homosexual by instinct or nature
2035830 by the end of the 80s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognise as homosexual by nature
2035831 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had the about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2035832 i believe that lambeth 1 10 is still the teaching of the communion
2035833 most christian homosexuals i know have no interest in converting anyone to their orientation far from it nor are they asking for a charter for promiscuity i should deplore either of those and i have said publicly that anything that looks like pressure to adopt homosexual behaviour especially in an educations context is wrong in my eyes

2035937 the bush administration informed all foreign intelligence and law enforcement teams visiting their citizens held at guantanamo bay that video and sound from their interrogation sessions would be recorded according to documents obtained by the washington post
2035938 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
2035939 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
2035940 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
2035941 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
2035942 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
2035943 the value we saw was that these guys would know their nationals and could get information better than we could
2035944 we were pretty green in this area at that time we also wanted to know what was going on in the room because we were on the hook for the well being of everyone that came in there
2035945 i dont remember anyone talking about knowing they were being videotaped in those meetings but if you have the khadr videotape and this statement that seems pretty clear the question is did the u s destroy everything
2035946 interrogators from recognized human rights abusing regimes onto the u s military base
2035947 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that these tapes did in fact exist and that contrary to what the military says it was absolutely sop
2035948 i would be shocked if they had not been destroyed
2035949 i think theres no question if you invite someone in and they threaten them the person who invited them in should be held accountable
2035950 we will request any and all videotapes by u s and foreign intelligence services to find out what was being done to them and what threats were made against them

2035959 they said there was more of a priority in other places i told them i was disappointed
2035960 weve had no good correspondence since the storm hit its abandonment as far as im concerned
2035961 we had some areas outside of the city with safety issues with downed wires and with critical facilities that we needed to help

2035979 only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone
2035980 most people even though they dont know it are asleep they never understand the loveliness and the beauty of this thing that we call human existence
2035981 every day that is born into the world comes like a burst of music and rings the whole day through and you make of it a dance a dirge or a life march as you will
2035982 one day you finally knew what you had to do and began
2035983 i may not have gone where i intended to go but i think i have ended up where i intended to be
2035984 and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance i hope you dance i hope you dance
2035985 life is no brief candle to me it is a sort of splendid torch that i have got hold of for the moment and i want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations
2035986 finish each day and be done with it you have done what you could some blunders and absurdities have crept in forget them as soon as you can tomorrow is a new day you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense
2035987 you can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep spring from coming
2035988 i see my path but i dont know where it leads not knowing where im going is what inspires me to travel it

2036024 first there was skkull then there was the drone drug continuing on the same path the sound of the drone drug is of a similar relentless minimalistic nature as its predesessor this could be seen as the electronic backbone to last years amazing blood spirits amp drums are singing conspiracy records creating a heavy beast with the most basic and stripped down use of variations in drones and frequencies instead of guitars and percussion monotonous motor humming via drugged out machinery and assaults of feedback attacking with a strong feel of claustrophobia compared to skkull the drone drug evolves more around a grim and abrasive sound constantly toying with lo fi aesthetics and a rough industrial edge the atmosphere created is thick and black bringing up visions of a dystopian society trembling on the edge of the world spreading the disease in a world slowly dying the drone drug is poison and affect you it will on this recording the skull defekts is joachim nordwall and henrik rylander 4 tracks cut by an unsharpened razor total playtime of 52 minutes 4 panel digipack with artwork by daniel fagerstr m

2036029 the sky done clouded over after glory fckn suns debut album yielding this brooding and corrosive follow up the new zealand sorta super group of antony milton ben spiers and simon ororke concoct a slow burning behemoth of metallic shivers and distortion churn dark enough to invoke the dread name haino spectra is an unsettling mind meld spiers desolate soundscapes bleed into miltons heavy drones which are complemented perfectly by ororkes restless percussion group improvisation is the natural language of these three even listing their solo and collaborative albums over the past decade would take way more effort than i can muster suffice to say this is a stellar and unique record to add to their massive discographies

2036041 portlands tone wrangler aaron davis aka acre has been blasting the world with his massive but barely there feedback swells for quite some time with releases on black horizons jk and more his first lp offering brings about the acre essence quite well massive walls of shoe gazed feedback are some how tamed into smooth quintessential drones this is not the sound of synthesizers or keyboards but a single tone being modified and replicated into a monolithic piece stasis so strong it is hard to realize the power of these two side long tracks until they end forcing silence back upon the listener direct hypnosis and transcendental zoning

2036113 first there was skkull then there was the drone drug continuing on the same path the sound of the drone drug is of a similar relentless minimalistic nature as its predesessor this could be seen as the electronic backbone to last years amazing blood spirits amp drums are singing conspiracy records creating a heavy beast with the most basic and stripped down use of variations in drones and frequencies instead of guitars and percussion monotonous motor humming via drugged out machinery and assaults of feedback attacking with a strong feel of claustrophobia compared to skkull the drone drug evolves more around a grim and abrasive sound constantly toying with lo fi aesthetics and a rough industrial edge the atmosphere created is thick and black bringing up visions of a dystopian society trembling on the edge of the world spreading the disease in a world slowly dying the drone drug is poison and affect you it will on this recording the skull defekts is joachim nordwall and henrik rylander 4 tracks cut by an unsharpened razor total playtime of 52 minutes 4 panel digipack with artwork by daniel fagerstr m

2036274 we were pleased by the positive customer response this summer to our sunshine guaranteed vacation packages and we have decided to offer them again for late summer and fall travel
2036275 with schools back in session fall can be an excellent time for a crowd free vacation we also recognize that rainouts may be a particular concern for some destinations during the peak hurricane season and we have included many of these destinations in our new sunshine guaranteed promotion
2036276 i purchased the package through priceline because the price was fantastic and no other service was offering sunshine guaranteed vacations
2036277 now because of the refund i can take two vacations thank you priceline

2036282 this years fredericksburg fair had the usual attractions hercula the giant horse and black jack the giant steer the carnival rides and the four wheeler races but added to the mix was something virginians had not seen for decades the earnest campaigning of a competitive presidential race
2036283 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
2036284 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
2036285 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
2036286 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race
2036287 even in 1996 when bill clinton was winning every state imaginable bob dole won virginia because our people showed up
2036288 for a race thats going to be as close as this is it will take a lot of pieces of the puzzle for us to add to be successful
2036289 we are doing exactly what republican campaigns have done in the past
2036290 all they have to do is add water every four years
2036291 weve got to get to a level of organization that really hasnt been done before here
2036292 it is no doubt they are going to register anything that can walk talk and chew gum at the same time so that will give them an advantage
2036293 anyone who they have registered they will then go grab them by the back of the scruff and take them out to vote
2036294 i would say eight in 10 doors we go to are either strong self identified democrats who are for obama or frustrated moderate republicans who dont believe mccain represents change from bush
2036295 if youre a military family you might just want to support the one who is going to bring your families home
2036296 this is a unique situation where there is both an up ticket effect and a down ticket effect
2036297 the obama effort on turnout is going to have a positive effect that will help mark and i also think mark will perform so well and organize so strongly in some traditionally republican parts of the state that that will help obama
2036298 i suspect most virginians kind of like the notion that a virginian can be in key leadership nationally
2036299 how that translates into any effect on election day i dont know
2036300 were going to need to get massive turnout in northern virginia
2036301 personally for me its exciting because virginia republicans can make a difference

2036451 maka apabila telah habis bulan suci hendaklah perangi orang orang musyrik di mana kamu jumpai dan hendaklah ambil mereka itu menjadi tawanan dan kepunglah mereka dan serang hendaplah mereka pada tiap tiap jalan yang dilaluinya
2036452 hai nabi muhammad ajaklah orang orang yang beriman orang islam itu berperang jika ada dua puluh orang diantaramu yang berhati sabar nescaya dapat mereka mengalahkan dua ratus orang kafir jika ada seratus diantara kamu dapat mengalahkan seribu orang kafir kerana mereka itu tiada mengerti
2036453 sesungguhnya orang orang yang menentang allah dan rasulnya mereka itu termasuk dalam orang orang yang terhina allah telah menuliskan demi sesungguhnya aku akan menang aku dan rasul rasulku sungguh allah mahakuat lagi maha perkuasa engkau tiada memperoleh kaum yang beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian bahawa mereka mengasihi orang orang yang menentang allah dan rasulnya meskipun mereka itu bapa anak saudara atau kaum keluarga mereka
2036454 perangilah orang orang yang tiada beriman kepada allah dan hari yang kemudian mereka tiada mengharamkan apa yang telah diharamkan allah dan rasulnya dan tiada pula beragama dengan agama yang benar
2036455 diperlukan atas kamu untuk berperang sedang berperang itu suatu yang kamu benci dan boleh jadi kamu benci akan sesuatu sedang ia lebih baik untukmu
2036456 apabila kamu menemui orang orang kafir di medan perang maka pukullah leher mereka sehingga bila telah banyak kamu membunuh mereka maka tawanlah mereka dan kukuhkanlah ikatan tawanan itu orang yang terbunuh pada jalan allah mempertahankan agamanya maka tiadalah disia siakan amalan mereka
2036457 sesungguhnya allah mempertahankan mereka yang beriman sesungguhnya allah tiada mengasihi tiap tiap orang khianat lagi kafir telah diizinkan berperang kepada mereka yang diperangi disebabkan mereka teraniaya sesungguhnya allah mahakuasa menolong mereka itu yaitu orang orang yang diusir dari negerinya tanpa kebenaran sesungguhnya allah menolong orang yang menolongnya sungguh allah mahakuat lagi mahakuasa

2036462 ya allah capailah untuk aku apa yang engkau telah menjanjikan aku ya allah bawalah apa yang engkau telah janjikan dulu ya allah jika kumpulan muslim yang kecil ini terhapus engkau tidak akan disembah di bumi ini
2036463 sesungguhnya allah telah menolongmu ketika peperangan di badar sedangkan kamu lemah maka takutlah kamu kepada allah mudah mudahan kamu berterima kasih ketika kamu berkata kepada orang orang beriman dalam perang tidakkah mencukupi bagimu bahawa tuhanmu menolongmu dengan tiga ribu malaikat yang diturunkan ya jika kamu sabar dan taqwa dan datang orang orang kafir itu segera kepadamu tuhanmu menolongmu dengan lima ribu malaikat yang mempunyai tanda

2036539 i have spent much of my life choosing my own attitude often carelessly often for no better reason than to indulge a conceit in those instances my acts of self determination were mistakes some of which did no lasting harm and serve now only to embarrass and occasionally amuse the old man who recalls them others i deeply regret at other times i chose my own way with good cause and to good effect i did not do so to apologize for my mistakes my contrition is a separate matter when i chose well i did so to keep a balance in my life a balance between pride and regret between liberty and honor
2036540 chris his military service has never exempted him from legitimate criticism
2036541 as we talk editor christopher ruddy and natan sharansky barack obama is here visiting israel sharansky is dubious of the candidate
2036542 a little record or almost no record while the one who he is competing with is mccain and we know for sure his principles
2036543 it is very alarming for me the way senator obama voted the way he spoke about his desire to negotiate with ahmadinejad and the way some of his advisers think
2036544 i was at aipac he made a very strong speech speaking about a jewish state defensible borders a united jerusalem then the next day he started correcting himself
2036545 hamas considers the remarks of the democratic candidate today to be part of the american policy of bias towards israel and giving legitimacy to israeli crimes against our people his remarks today give cover for the occupations nonstop crimes against our people

2036548 he is well aware voters here at home might see that as presumptuous
2036549 whether by the end of this week he will be seen as presumptuous or overly cocky
2036550 that means walking the fine line between looking presidential and appearing arrogant and presumptuous
2036551 plus the growing sense in some quarters that the presumptive democratic nominee is getting a little presumptuous

2036562 were dependent so much on oil from people who dont like us
2036563 we have the votes which is the only rational explanation why pelosi refused for the entire summer to give the congress a vote on something that would give the americans more oil
2036564 at least 20 democrats have already said they would vote for the bill
2036565 give the bipartisan pro drilling majority a chance to vote
2036566 lets make this a bipartisan demonstration were calling on them democrats to take a stand
2036567 shes having to save 2 400 for kerosene for the winter double what she had to in the past
2036568 if pelosi gets her way the u s will be powerless
2036569 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania
2036570 that means the nbc abc and cbs newscasts will originate from stops on the trip and undoubtedly play it up
2036571 why do you think they are the most watched out of the major stations
2036572 no politician who votes to leave my family stranded sol in iraq would be getting my vote
2036573 secondly can you not see that obama has done exactly what you are saying he doesnt do he votes for the money to fund war votes to condemn attacks on troops and yells for about the need for more troops in afghanistan all while convincing dems that he is not responsible for war
2036574 so there are a range of factors that i have to take into account as a commander in chief or a potential commander in chief that i wouldnt expect general petraeus or anybody whos just on the ground to have to take into account
2036575 we dont know what would have happened if we did what i suggested
2036576 i was referring to your comments to babs where you were comparing who voted for the dont attack our troops measure i believe you pointed out obama voted for it and mac didnt my point was that when obama takes a position it is never a stretch for him to do it he is getting the benefit of being against the war yet he never had to decide if he would have voted for the war like 99 of his mates
2036577 as far as leased land and drilling permits congress has made it illegal for them to drill off shore they cannot drill offshore so they dont lease offshore the argument is not about exploring the land they do have its about pumping the known resources that they cannot have access to
2036578 my friend from texas is taking one example attacking an organization that he doesnt agree with i am sure of that and we are going to be pretty busy in the senate if we turn into the ad police when senator cleland was attacked we didnt have a resolution on the floor of the senate when senator kerry was attacked we didnt do it when general batiste was attacked we didnt do it for general zinni we didnt do it we did speak out and we did speak out about the ad all of us on both sides of the aisle that attacked general petraeus but we didnt have a resolution all these times suddenly now a political organization is attacked by name in a resolution in something that reminds me of the old bad days in america when organizations were attacked by the government so what we have done is we have written this i thank senators levin and reid and durbin and other senators who believe what we see is a trend to attack heroes we say it is wrong we dont go after one organization we say it is wrong let me show you the max cleland ad we have the picture of max cleland in the same ad with osama bin laden and saddam hussein this is what senator mccain had to say about that ad here is what he said ive never seen anything like that ad putting pictures of saddam hussein and osama bin laden next to a man who lost three limbs on the battlefield its worse than disgraceful its reprehensible but we didnt come down and pass a resolution attacking the campaign that ran this ad but now we have an attack on one organization it is wrong it should be defeated this amendment i have offered is the one that ought to pass this chamber
2036579 before you think to yourself here we go with clinton again i fully supported him in that somalia until he left with his tail tucked
2036580 obama is looked at as the anti war weak foreign policy candidate he will get issues pertaining to that looked at harder i mean come on is it not a moronic position to vote on a resolution expressing that attacking our troops is wrong while you acknowledge you plan on fighting and winning the war on terror all while demanding troop reduction in iraq so you can send them to afghanistan i mean do we really think the terrorist would target our troops and then call it off because the u s senate said it was wrong to do so
2036581 obama well you know i think that there are so many issues in which i am not an expert but require you to be an expert that the most important job that i will have as president is choosing excellent people to help to shape policy and provide me with a clear set of decisions
2036582 obama is looked at as the anti war weak foreign policy candidate he will get issues pertaining to that looked at harder i mean come on is it not a moronic position to vote on a resolution expressing that attacking our troops is wrong while you acknowledge you plan on fighting and winning the war on terror all while demanding troop reduction in iraq so you can send them to afghanistan i mean do we really think the terrorist would target our troops and then call it off because the u s senate said it was wrong to do so
2036583 fox is the more balanced of all the major stations
2036584 n essence i believe that is the bottom line to what liberals want us to do they think we should talk to people who we already know want to kill us us includes britain france germany spian and all our friends talking means trusting and i cant trust people who announce openly that i should not live unless it is under their feet
2036585 the sites seem largely incapable of generating revenues commensurate with their popularity
2036586 i dont think we have the killer best way to advertise and monetize social networks yet
2036587 the goal is not to collect more data its about extracting insight from this data
2036588 with the cost of fuel and other goods do you really think theyre going to want to spend another cent epstein told the daily journal when asked about her position
2036589 but i have a problem with the state shirking its responsibility theyre the ones that should be paying for school construction

2036594 martin oneill must be the only manager in the world who wont spend money that is available to him that is if you believe he has money available to him im sure he has but im also fairly sure its not very much certainly not as much as we need to break into the top four football is all pr these days sometimes youve got to dismiss the pr try to figure out the most likely reason for something and it usually is the right reason actually there is a theory the most obvious answer is usually the right one

2036635 for lack of a better word woah brad rose is back at the helm of his ever welcome shapeshifting solo guise the north sea submarine museum is a continuous 33 minute cassette side depicting a sonic mandala riddled with points of desperate beauty and feedbacked death throe the first two thirds of the guitar based piece flows from humble pulses into a squall of the vertical blood quickening sort but thats precisely where the atmospheres glowing membrane is pierced letting through a sharp bodhi light of release and penultimate peace for the final third of the journey catch breath repeat
2036636 we here at stunned appreciate small doses which provide big effects so when texas drone dude landon odle sent us his glazed glitter debut 3
2036637 never did know how the uke of spaces corners wove them mounds of spook through such innocent jam dillies i reckon it is what must be the outlandish croon or perchance that lonely electric guitar ever it functions sure leaves a rippling swelling watermark of the solitary songmanship jangling in mulchy fullness but reflecting a singular dream apparition
2036638 mustve been a big pea pod what which encased these two sweet too do only say so cause these songs smack of such a chunky love coated brotherhood none can help but to feel a resounding sense of connectedness youth closure you could say explore them extra hairs and grown feelings with swilly tender songiness

2036647 the minotaure ep is a 20 minute exercise in raw dark noiserock from the dungeons of the bergen netherworld
2036648 first there was skkull then there was the drone drug continuing on the same path the sound of the drone drug is of a similar relentless minimalistic nature as its predesessor this could be seen as the electronic backbone to last years amazing blood spirits amp drums are singing conspiracy records creating a heavy beast with the most basic and stripped down use of variations in drones and frequencies instead of guitars and percussion monotonous motor humming via drugged out machinery and assaults of feedback attacking with a strong feel of claustrophobia compared to skkull the drone drug evolves more around a grim and abrasive sound constantly toying with lo fi aesthetics and a rough industrial edge the atmosphere created is thick and black bringing up visions of a dystopian society trembling on the edge of the world spreading the disease in a world slowly dying the drone drug is poison and affect you it will on this recording the skull defekts is joachim nordwall and henrik rylander 4 tracks cut by an unsharpened razor total playtime of 52 minutes 4 panel digipack with artwork by daniel fagerstr m

2036654 the fourth album by the sample sculptor of finlands oulu features only one long piece of sound slowly and ponderously developing sound mass moves between minimalist ambient and melodic sequences both beautiful and mentally jarring it is both organic and spacy almost at the same time

2036744 and the invitation opens up another a new metaphor of life as a dance dancing as the adventure of being alive which brings us back to the question will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance
2036745 i could see from reading on that the metaphor of golf for life worked on lots of levels you always learn something new it can be difficult challenging fun and rewarding
2036746 but looking too hard for the one true path can create its own problems you can find yourself fixed on finding the answer rather than noticing and enjoying where you are the path that is unfolding under your feet the trail you have left behind and it can leave you focused on the path that other people have created the shoulds of other peoples expectations or the trails that others have blazed rather than the path that is distinctly yours focused on external pointers and signs rather than trusting your instincts and intuition to find your way
2036747 i know i know it doesnt take einstein to read and apply the lessons from the art of juggling as a metaphor for life in fact im constantly amazed by the relevance of each learning point for other areas of life of work of learning where ive got temporarily stuck
2036748 never did know how the uke of spaces corners wove them mounds of spook through such innocent jam dillies i reckon it is what must be the outlandish croon or perchance that lonely electric guitar ever it functions sure leaves a rippling swelling watermark of the solitary songmanship jangling in mulchy fullness but reflecting a singular dream apparition
2036749 mustve been a big pea pod what which encased these two sweet too do only say so cause these songs smack of such a chunky love coated brotherhood none can help but to feel a resounding sense of connectedness youth closure you could say explore them extra hairs and grown feelings with swilly tender songiness
2036750 we hit up our fourth vinyl release with this beauty which was originally intended to be a cassette only release it still will be available on cassette but only in a tiny run this maine based crew features a host of psychedelic jam talent nemo of drona parva and head honcho of time lag records sparrow wildchild of the bummer road and the three members of visitations whose record on time lag last year was one of 2007s best so this is the second recording from this crew the first being last years sloow tape this beast is different to the sloow vibe still with a super nice jam band sound but projecting to a maybe more song in the loosest possible way based plane a little like visitations
2036751 cassette version of the above lp this maine based crew features a host of psychedelic jam talent nemo of drona parva and head honcho of time lag records sparrow wildchild of the bummer road and the three members of visitations whose record on time lag last year was one of 2007s best so this is the second recording from this crew the first being last years sloow tape this beast is different to the sloow vibe still with a super nice jam band sound but projecting to a maybe more song in the loosest possible way based plane a little like visitations
2036752 ok so i dont support any kids getting married to old dudes its not cool but then this is a new recording by the child bride spooked vocals weird clunks cut up surreal vibes this one is a real slayer almost like some kinda fucked up singer songwriter noise styles the killer gem here has gotta be rabbit moon some far out repetitive churns some how blurring supremely with some thudding rumbling and then some killer trance drugged vocal thatll hypnotize your mind man
2036753 another release from our newcastle brothers eyeballs is richard dawson and the sea of william henry smyth is a real nice minimal ambient ish drone piece multi layered and multi textural if youre into gareth hardwick and kranky records youll be into this for sure
2036754 new tape from my buddy cybele whos based in providence total free violin slashes and carves busted out then dropping right off to some super quiet and minimal experimentations one to shred your speakers awesome stuff previously had tape on night people label
2036755 solo live blurt from 25 june 2008 from sindre bjerga one half of bjerga iversen background drones hit in immediatley accompanied with some minimal scrapes and sputtering kinda growth aura from aforementioned drone theres a real static vibe cruising through this occasional clunk and taps blur away as the heavy dense drone consumes the lot like an electric mist with feedback clots clogging up your lungs and creepy terror sounds
2036756 10 tracks of dark and droning layers of organ voice and electronics calling you from a mysterious place
2036757 glitchy cutting moving delicate sounds pop through the shifting noise hidden tunes appear an album that grows steadily more fascinating with every listen
2036758 the minotaure ep is a 20 minute exercise in raw dark noiserock from the dungeons of the bergen netherworld
2036759 first there was skkull then there was the drone drug continuing on the same path the sound of the drone drug is of a similar relentless minimalistic nature as its predesessor this could be seen as the electronic backbone to last years amazing blood spirits amp drums are singing conspiracy records creating a heavy beast with the most basic and stripped down use of variations in drones and frequencies instead of guitars and percussion monotonous motor humming via drugged out machinery and assaults of feedback attacking with a strong feel of claustrophobia compared to skkull the drone drug evolves more around a grim and abrasive sound constantly toying with lo fi aesthetics and a rough industrial edge the atmosphere created is thick and black bringing up visions of a dystopian society trembling on the edge of the world spreading the disease in a world slowly dying the drone drug is poison and affect you it will on this recording the skull defekts is joachim nordwall and henrik rylander 4 tracks cut by an unsharpened razor total playtime of 52 minutes 4 panel digipack with artwork by daniel fagerstr m
2036760 three solo offerings from half of the birds of delay unit luke younger everything comes together in a sort of calming yet virulent way like rivers of red and black filled with dead birds falling from the sky chrysalis is sort of like a anodynic end to all things one quick bite of the apocolypse that makes everything feel good
2036761 new born duo of eva aguila kevin shields gang wizard and britnay gould married in berdichev lay down some of the most beautiful hideous beautiful again experimental music around the two create juxtopositions of gently sung vocals with scrapyard convulsions layered overtop of each other with results that are next level hypnotic
2036762 the stay blazed team up of conneticuts chris donofrio and donovan fazzino get up in them guts with some comatose low blows spread out over twenty minutes tones get deep in the earth take a nap in the crust and are discovered years later when they forget to wake up bring a blanket and maybe a few coffin nails
2036763 two more doses of shiflet drone blazing here in the live variety recorded earlier this year in st louis and cleveland for those not in attendance you can acquire mikes sleeperhold synth styleings here and get a second chance to wipe your brain off of your shoulders
2036764 the sky done clouded over after glory fckn suns debut album yielding this brooding and corrosive follow up the new zealand sorta super group of antony milton ben spiers and simon ororke concoct a slow burning behemoth of metallic shivers and distortion churn dark enough to invoke the dread name haino spectra is an unsettling mind meld spiers desolate soundscapes bleed into miltons heavy drones which are complemented perfectly by ororkes restless percussion group improvisation is the natural language of these three even listing their solo and collaborative albums over the past decade would take way more effort than i can muster suffice to say this is a stellar and unique record to add to their massive discographies
2036765 the fourth album by the sample sculptor of finlands oulu features only one long piece of sound slowly and ponderously developing sound mass moves between minimalist ambient and melodic sequences both beautiful and mentally jarring it is both organic and spacy almost at the same time
2036766 eva of kevin shields gang wizard and britnay of married in berdichev explore the relationship of love songs and harsh noise beautiful singing lost harmonies and bonebreaking thrash

2036829 my commitment was to withdraw from public life and not to endanger in any way the implementation of the dayton agreement to withdraw even from literary life and any form of public life
2036830 this is a matter of life and death if mr holbrooke wants to have me dead and if his arm is so very long then i want to know if his arm can also reach me here
2036831 mr karadzic apparently you want to bring to the attention of this chamber that some agreement apparently between persons attached to states were made
2036832 of course the chamber is not aware of any such agreements if you want to raise this issue then of course it would be important for us to then have the full facts
2036833 i have an invisible legal adviser but i have decided to defend myself on my own
2036834 i am not interested in having someone else read the indictment to me
2036835 i would rather receive the new indictment that has been announced and have sufficient time to study it and then have my initial appearance for that and enter my plea
2036836 it is obviously not going to be very short but i suspect that the evidence against karadzic which is more focused geographically and time wise than the evidence on milosevic and that may include evidence that is in a sense stronger than the evidence that was available for the milosevic case
2036837 it shouldnt be anything like as long as the milosevic trial the difficulty of course may be in the judges managing of karadzic if he chooses as was said on his behalf to represent himself
2036838 to prolong the trial by spending time on irrelevant matters it may also be the case that the judges will now be well equipped to deal with that and to shut him down and to keep the trial to strictly legal issues

2037113 se gi qui venga subito che la preside vuole vederla
2037114 mi scusi signora pina chiesi allapplicata pu farmi avere la domanda che la preside ha approvato
2037115 ma quale domanda e domanda sbott la preside lei lha presentata per il cambio turno non per lassenza dagli scrutini di ieri
2037116 lei crede di poter fare quello che desidera lei pensa di essere un cane sciolto libero di non presentarsi agli scrutini ma dico agli scrutiniii urlato con crescente parossismo
2037117 ma preside replicai io non ho mai pensato di poter fare quello che voglio sono anzi fin troppo ligia alle regole appunto per questo ho presentato domanda che lei ha firmato informandola che sarei stata al corso dalle 15 00 alle 19 00 proprio nellora in cui si tenevano gli scrutini
2037118 non dica sciocchezze la sua domanda si riferiva al cambio turno e allorario del corso non agli scrutini lei ha fatto come le piaciuto
2037119 preside nella mia domanda era implicito che la presenza al corso avrebbe impedito la mia presenza agli scrutini mi pareva chiaro
2037120 sar chiaro per lei ma non per tutti gli altri lei si presa una grandissima libert che le far pagare a caro prezzo in questa scuola se lo metta bene in testa lei non pu fare come vuole anche labitudine di ricevere qualche minuto prima i genitori ai colloqui lei se la deve togliere
2037121 preside io ho tanti alunni cos ho pi tempo per parlare con i genitori di tutti e trascurarne meno possibili non tolgo nulla a nessuno anzi impiego il mio tempo che non verr retribuito
2037122 non questo il punto io devo sapere quello che fa da questo momento in poi voglio avere il calendario con i minuti precisi che intende dedicare ai genitori non sono permessi i cani sciolti in questa scuola per farglielo capire meglio le scriver immediatamente un avvertimento disciplinare

2037134 im confident that our troops will be successful and i think iraq war will go relatively quickly weeks rather than months
2037135 what i mean instead is that know nothingism the insistence that there are simple brute force instant gratification answers to every problem and that theres something effeminate and weak about anyone who suggests otherwise has become the core of republican policy and political strategy
2037136 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2037137 if obama gets the nomination im going to vote for the candidate who left his first wife after she was disfigured in a car accident who pimped his current wife out to a crowd of bikers and who voted against equal wages for women that makes perfect sense

2037140 the prices of real estate did not rise despite the increase in cost of construction materials
2037141 the costs of the construction materials have increased by nearly 26 percent from the beginning of january to the end of june th s year meanwhile employment costs rose almost 8 percent for the same time span
2037142 while the yearly inflation rate stands at approximately 12 percent this level of increase in the construction costs is highly challenging
2037143 we have high expectations for the real estate sector and believe that the sector will enter a positive period from september onwards
2037144 construction companies cannot increase the sales prices in spite of the rise in their costs

2037152 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2037153 obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2037154 if you make over 32 000 per year barack obama has voted to raise your taxes

2037164 the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign

2037168 without programmed cell death the bonds that bind cells in complex multicellular organisms might never have evolved and because programmed cell death depends on mitochondria it may be that multicellular organisms could not exist without mitochondria
2037169 mitochondrial diseases typically affect metabolically active tissues such as the muscle and brain producing seizures some movement disorders blindness deafness and muscular degeneration
2037170 in the 1960s evolutionary theorist george williams argued that benefits to the group are too weak a force to be invoked as an evolutionary explanation evolution is in the business of testing random mutations that first arise in a single individual the first test for any new trait is whether it can progress from the individual to achieve prevalence in a group only traits that passed this test can ever be tested in competition group against group hence individual selection will trump group selection every time williams said aging and the imposition of a finite lifespan may well have the potential to help maintain population diversity but this benefit accrues only to the group aging harms the individual who ages and puts that individual at a selective disadvantage hence aging can never be selected as an adaptation
2037171 one should also note the historical context of the film this is an american movie about torturing people made at a time when america right or wrong is receiving flak for torturing prisoners in iraq and elsewhere and makes no mention of the current world situation its also worth noting that the audience i watched this picture with cheered and applauded at each new horror it all seemed so circus maximus

2037208 were both graphic designers and we were busy with work so whatever i did couldnt interfere with either of our workloads in a sense i had to work backwards we moved in plugged in the computers and then began working on how the studio should be arranged i worked in the evenings and on weekends so i wouldnt interfere with business and id tell my wife several days before moving or disconnecting equipment so our work interruptions were minimized
2037209 id spent many years working in different office environments so i had several ideas about how best to use our new workspace id always loved the openness of the design and architecture firms in which id worked and i wanted to avoid the sterility of cubicles but since we had a very tight budget i was constantly searching freecycle for used and free office equipment i found chairs a conference table all sorts of miscellaneous items and a free color laser printer that only needed a good cleaning and a new fuser assembly

2037245 eenmaal aangekomen bleek onmiddelijk dat de organisatie totaal onvoorbereid was om ons daar te ontvangen onze cellen waren niet schoongemaakt er waren geen bedden of beddegoed geen werktafel of stoel zoals beloofd was geen stromend water geen werk materialen om mee te werken elke kunstnaar was gevraagd om een lijst met materialen en benodigheden in te dienen bij de organisatie om voor die 29 dagen werk te maken deze materialen zouden vanaf dag n tot de kunstnaars beschikking zijn al die avond werd duidelijk dat er geen geld was voor deze materialen alhoewel er nog steeds beloofd werd dat deze zouden komen geen geld voor eten niet genoeg vrijwilligers om het project te runnen bovendien kwam de brandweer onverwacht langs en bleek het gebouw geheel niet te voldoen aan de veiligheids voorschriften kunstenaars werden voorzien van een luchtbedje en werden gevraags zelf het gebouw af te struinen op zoek naar tafels en stoelen en naar eventuele materialen de kunstenaars en de vrijwillegers hebben zelf gezorgd voor boodscappen en voedsel de organisatie heeft hier geen geld ingestoken alleen beloofd het terug te betalen de kunstenaars was 1000 euro beloofd als stipendium ook daar kan naar gefloten worden na 5 dagen van valse beloftes veel verwarring en frustraties hebben 7 kunstenaars zich terug getrokken van het project omdat wij inzien dat er niks gaat veranderen en de situatie volkomen nergens meer opslaat nu zijn we opzoek naar onderdak van een aantal van de gestrande kunstenaars bovendien willen we graag het ware verhaal naar buiten laten komen zodat er niet langer een vals beeld van het project georganiseerd door episodes onderleiding van anthony murell bestaat en dit schandalige en rampzalige project en organisatie gezien kan worden voor wat het is

2037285 this year in the preseason i need to show that ive grown as a player i need to get out there and make some plays
2037286 i think paul has had a very steady very good camp
2037287 hes a guy that these games become very critical for because hes done a real nice job in what were doing now it becomes live football and hes going to get a chance to tackle which should be one of his strengths then youll see how he handles everything that hes been working on for the last six months
2037288 i know the defense and i know whats being asked of me
2037289 i like playing free safety and getting to sit back there and read his eyes these games are going to be big for me to just play and show how hard ive worked over the last year
2037290 its been so long since ive been out there that ive been excited about this chance for a long time
2037291 you hear people talking about you but they havent really seen you yet ill finally get to be out there and hopefully show people what i can do

2037300 the chances of key local polls taking place in iraq this year all but vanished yesterday after parliament failed to pass a law on elections because of a row over the contested city of kirkuk which threatens to heighten arab kurdish tensions
2037301 the iraqi parliament speaker ended an emergency parliamentary session wednesday after the political blocs failed to reach an agreement over a disputed provincial election bill parliament speaker mahmoud al mashhadani said by the end of the 44th session on wednesday the parliament concluded its first legislative term and would resume sessions on sept 9
2037302 roughly half of the 48 billion dollar budget of 2008 approved earlier by the parliament
2037303 i can confirm to you that we have lost the chance to hold the elections in october
2037304 iraqi politicians officials and western diplomats have speculated that the political parties in government were never invested in holding a vote this year out of fear they would lose seats and influence at the provincial level senior politicians including president jalal talabani a kurd and vice president tariq hashimi a sunni arab have been absent from baghdad during the round the clock negotiations citing medical reasons
2037305 the elections would be the first provincial balloting in almost four years
2037306 i listened to many of them i noticed that most of them talk about kirkuk in a way as if its a prey for the greed and abmitions of their parties they never talk about it as a part of iraq because they dont care about iraq they care only about their limited personal interests
2037307 however the iraqi government and legislature continue to bicker about how to disburse that money while u s taxpayers are left to fund roughly 48 billion in reconstruction projects if something in this picture seems wrong to you welcome to a growing club which includes republican and democratic leaders on capitol hill who say iraq should start paying more of its own bills
2037308 yes its true that the iraqi government is spending little on reconstruction the weak iraqi capability to do big projects maybe at the end of 2008 will improve
2037309 signs of iraqs slowness to rebuild are everywhere in baghdad roughly 20 of the city is without proper sewage pipes published statistics say the baghdad is getting roughly 11 hours of electricity a day on average but many residents go days with only sporadic bursts of power iraqi officials say fixing just this problem could take up to 10 years chronic electricity shortages for another decade mean little energy for construction making iraqi hopes for a renewed capital seem distant
2037310 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for us taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
2037311 this is projected and not real money we have many reconstruction projects and as you know most of the infrastruture of the country had collapsed after the war and that needs a lot of money to rebuild the country
2037312 as of december 31 2007 the iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of 29 4 billion held in the development fund for iraq and central government deposits at the central bank of iraq and iraqs commerical banks
2037313 from 2005 through 2007 the iraqi government generated an estimated 96 billion in cumulative revenues of which crude oil export sales accounted for about 90
2037314 the source of this surplus is the high price of oil money thats added to the pot when we fill our family gas tank
2037315 with oil prices at or near all time highs it has become increasingly apparent that iraq is closer than ever to financial independence with the extreme property damage caused by an invasion of questionable legality the need for security and reconstruction monies is great but who should be held accountable many us taxpayers are becoming disenchanted due to the fact that with nearly 33 billion in oil earnings in the first half of 2008 iraq is now capable of shouldering an increased share of the burden our own economy is floundering and many simply feel that it is time for iraq to step up and assume control over its own destiny
2037316 two numbers 482 billion and 79 billion the first is next years projected federal budget deficit a record the second is the budget surplus that iraq is expected to accumulate by the end of the year is there any question which government whose taxpayers should be footing the bill for reconstruction projects in iraq
2037317 something is out of whack iraqis are very proud to say that its their country and they are right so they should fix it
2037318 many iraqis who lack adequate electricity clean water and jobs find it unfathomable their country is awash in oil dollars last year it spent less than a third of the 12 billion budgeted for major projects such as electricity housing and water
2037319 five star hotels parking garages a theater restaurant aquarium and basketball courts casino and boat rides but given the lagging basic services reporters questioned whether baghdads priorities are appropriate and realistic with temperatures hittign 130 degrees many parts of iraq dont have a steady electricity supply and some areas only get two hours a day getting clean water and adequate health care are also major issues

2037322 you got two choices you stay home and not vote or if you want your vote to mean something and you want to be with the winner you vote for one of the two major party candidates otherwise you are wasting your vote
2037323 were those voters in the 19th century who spun off from the whigs and the democrats and didnt try to spin the difference between these two parties on slavery waste their vote
2037324 ive done surveys and polls all over the country heres my conclusion 15 of the republicans will vote for the republican nominee if the republican nominee was leon trotsky and 15 of the democrats would vote for the democratic nominee if the nominee was ayn rand

2037329 nader accuses the news media of being in a cultural rut by ignoring him he said hed been on national television only 10 seconds this election cycle put me in all the debates and well have a three way race
2037330 the media is in a cultural rut i am not talking about their private incisive skeptical conversations with one another i am talking about the questions they dont ask the questions they ask give me a bunch of 10 year olds instead of the white house press corps and the president would be far far more upset and anxious dont be so cynical about small starts if nature was like you seeds would never have a chance to sprout

2037345 i had such a good time and the directors made me feel so comfortable
2037346 it was nerve racking but i did it and i want to do more acting i do want to be taken seriously as an actress
2037347 celebrity endorsements of politicians really dont mean much having campaigned for al gore and for john kerry i think that the only job that an entertainer may have is to attract media or attract people to a speaking engagement for said politician
2037348 i dont think celebrities impact people and nor should they
2037349 i have my political views but i dont think its important to share

2037908 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth

2038027 th june election with a small majority just 30 votes he immediately set about campaigning to persuade the public that they must join the eec use of the words lying and deceit should be reserved for the rarest of occasions but it is up to the reader to decide whether this description fits after reading this expose the players in this blessed plot to use hugo youngs title to his book about our membership of the eu to shoehorn britain in at any cost were the bbc other visual media including itv the press jean monnet and his action committee for a united states of europe the european movement metamorphosing itself into britain in europe during specific campaigns the foreign and commonwealth office fco and particularly its information research department ird led by the notorious norman reddaway the fco and its european integration department eid the fco and its european communities information unit eciu headed by w j adams acting as a sort of information control some conservative ministers and mps surreptitious involvement by brussels through its london office and for the opposition the keep britain out campaign led by christopher frere smith tony benn mp and douglas jay mp father of peter jay presenter of the bbc money programme there was little time to be wasted heaths majority was small and the british economy was in poor shape with high unemployment rising inflation and trouble from militant unions the heath government could fall at any time the bill for accession to the eec was to have its first reading in october 1971 just 15 months that the tide of public opinion was moving in their favour
2038028 to convince mps that the tide of public opinion is moving towards joining the eec
2038029 the discreet promotion of letters to the press through confidential brokers movement liaison is likewise important
2038030 the message should be coherent and simple repetition is essential
2038031 all those involved in news and current affairs are pro marketeers and we can depend upon them to press for as much time as possible
2038032 we are fortunate that communicators were now basically in favour of our entry this had not been true a few months ago
2038033 the impact was immediate reports from all sources indicated a substantial favourable movement of public opinion
2038034 in view of mr notorious anti market activities about entry and campaigning for that view in a so called democratic society was now it does not seem incumbent upon us to tell him the full story of the adaptation of secondary legislation to british requirements nor of the preparation of authentic english texts of community legislation

2038040 the eec information unit produced extremely good material but felt as a foreign organisation that it could not distribute it too widely
2038041 it was agreed that the bcem should distribute the units material on a wide scale under its own auspices
2038042 to meet the objectives of bringing citizens closer together the european commission has since 1989 been running an annual programme to support town twinning schemes which it regards as a valuable way of involving ordinary people and their elected representatives in european integration and of strengthening their sense of belonging to the european union

2038044 we take a solemn oath to maintain permanent ties between our municipalities to join forces so as to further to the best of our ability the success of this vital enterprise of peace and prosperity the european union
2038045 we shall not sign a treaty of accession which would commit us to the common fisheries policy or to agreement which did not satisfactorily protect our legitimate interests
2038046 to say that britain will no longer be ruled by the rule of the peoples representatives or to put it in constitutional terms by the queen in parliament
2038047 tendency found expression in a movement fanned by mr wedgewood benn for a national referendum on the issue it demanded attention through much of the that there was no serious demand for a referendum on joining is probably due to the ignorance of the public and some parliamentarians of the huge constitutional implications involved and because the waters were muddied by repeating the mantra that there was no essential loss of sovereignty involved and the fact that referenda were untried and described by the government at least as un british helps to explain why it didnt happen the impact of the european movements efforts in talking down a referendum can only be guessed at but the fact they did so shows their determination to exclude the public from having any influence in the outcome this was a matter of vital importance to everyone since the issue was who would be governing them in the future in retrospect the fact that edward heaths pledge of not joining without the was broken and a referendum refused was profoundly anti democratic the legitimacy of membership as a result is challenged to this day and that is not surprising the later cynical attempt by harold wilsons government to retrospectively legitimise membership through the 1975 referendum could not repair the damage legislation passed by illicit means cannot be legitimised later by holding a referendum it is no better than john prescotts october 2004 referendum to try to legitimise the appointed and illegitimate north east england regional assembly neera neera was set up in 1999 as part of 8 english regions and part of the eus europe wide regionalisation process to divide england and rule it the public are more aware now and saw through the scheme and decisively rejected it by more than three to one in the vote the public of 1975 however were taken in by the promises and fears of the time but were they to know then what is now widely showed public opinion consistently running at more than 3 to 1 against joining the eec in the first months of 1971 yet by july polls recorded albeit temporarily support and opposition evenly balanced this demonstrated the success of the governments high powered but illicit campaign the to convince mps that the tide of public opinion was moving in favour of joining the eec
2038048 clearly the question whether to have a whipped vote or a free vote on our side is a vital and complicated one
2038049 we anti market conservatives have had plenty of pressure put upon us not by
2038050 neil marten for example is under very strong pressure from his
2038051 the programme for such speakers should concentrate on constituencies represented by mps who were doubtful about entry
2038052 edward brown could be persuaded on grounds of loyalty to party eric bullus and john farr will be influenced by opinions in his constituency j h gray does not wish to bring the government down toby jessel could be persuaded by a leading figure in the party geraint morgan worried about his personal position jasper more and j h sutcliffe could be won over if there is a shift in public opinion robin turton concerned about the continuation of the conservative government
2038053 in breach of his election promise the prime minister has not got the full hearted
2038054 no parliament can preclude its successors from changing the law
2038055 we are to have imposed upon us a written constitution a
2038056 when the people feel they are being made subject to laws in which they feel they have played no part and taxes to which they have never consented respect for both law and government is undermined our tradition for order and peaceful change is based not only on the character of our own people but on an enduring if tacit bargain between government and governed that the former will play fair and will be scrupulous in how they deal with the peoples rights but if governments do not play fair if they behave in a way people consider to be in itself unconstitutional there is evidence enough in british history to show we are not a docile people but a very determined and fierce one indeed
2038057 that is why i take very seriously my right hon friend the prime ministers assurance that no countrys vital interests would be overruled by other members i rely on this safeguard and in the practice in the council of ministers i said that there would be no essential surrender of sovereignty and successive speakers from both sides of the house have agreed that there is no essential surrender of sovereignty
2038058 the idea of parliamentary government and of democracy is based as i understand it on confidence consent and credibility people will only do things under the law if they have confidence in the way the law is made
2038059 the speeches which we have so far heard from the government front bench have seemed to me to be designed not so much to defend as to conceal what the government are doing to parliament in this bill
2038060 millions of people in this country will feel as i do that legislation passed in this way with no consent cannot command the assent of the country and would lack moral and constitutional validity
2038061 the bill provides that a 100 or more treaties 10 volumes i am told will also be incorporated into the law of the united kingdom no attempt is made even to list them let alone list them in this bill
2038062 the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster tells us there are 1500 regulations 40 volumes of them there is no mention of the regulations in the bill no listing of them none is annexed to the bill the reason is obvious it is to debar us as far as possible from putting down amendments so that these treaties regulations and directives can be properly debated and so that the people who will have to obey them in future can know the law that they are obeying
2038063 then there is the vital matter of the pledge given by the right hon gentleman the prime minister during the last election on june 2 1970 and in paris before then about not joining the common market without the full hearted consent of parliament and the people
2038064 but if we proceed on a small majority the important election pledge given by the prime minister on behalf of our party will have been broken
2038065 the public will regard politicians rightly with utmost contempt and i am not prepared to condone that
2038066 we anti market conservatives have had plenty of pressure put
2038067 in our judicial system evolved over centuries the judge does not get involved in a case himself so much as listen to council for and against and then decided independently that system is to be assimilated much more closely to the french system of law where the judges are advocates for both sides are examining juries and at the end of the day pronounce judgement
2038068 let us wrap it up so that what we are talking about is the full hearted consent of the house of commons there was a debate in october a debate which did not deal with a precise proposition such as this when the house decided affirmatively by a vote of seven twelfths in favour in no country with a written constitution in none of the other countries which are participating in this operation with the united kingdom would such a proportion justify the major step which is involved in joining the community all of them have safeguards which require a much more generous margin even than that on which the house voted on it is suggested that the prime minister may say tonight that he will resign if he is unable to carry this bill his reason for saying this would be that his european commitments are crucial to his policies as a whole if he had said that at the general election he would have been the vanquished not the victor he would not have been the prime minister today
2038069 therefore if this house will not agree to a second reading of the bill tonight my colleagues and i are unanimous that in these circumstances this parliament cannot sensibly continue
2038070 the history of parliament over a thousand years has been the way in which the people of this country have been able to participate in the exercise of power this has taken a thousand years to bring about
2038071 but i believe that it is certain that by going into europe we shall see not something which is alien but a true alienation of the british people from the government and the control of their own interests that worries me greatly
2038072 all such rights powers liabilities obligations and restrictions from time to time created or arising by or under the treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect and be enforced allowed and followed accordingly

2038081 mats and i laid out some ground rules for each other beginning with our initial conversations back in late june
2038082 we spoke of a mutual interest which has resulted in why we are here today mats made it perfectly clear that playing in montreal was an extremely exciting proposition but at the same time he understood the enormity of the task he honestly admitted to me that he couldnt even begin to consider montreal as a destiny if his heart his mind and his body werent 100 committed to what would lie ahead should he decide to continue his career with us he made it very clear that he didnt feel his answers were right around the corner we chose to wait him out
2038083 it is all about the commitment the committment of the body and soul knowing what this means there is no way i could have taken joining the canadiens lightly it was important to me that when i made the decision to continue playing that it would be the right one and that i could say for certain that i felt physically mentally and emotionally up to it
2038084 of course it did the offers were flattering in ways when bob called showing the canadiens interest it really set me back i understood that i couldnt come to montreal with fears i was no longer good enough i needed to get to this point in the summer felt i felt physically confident enough to take this on
2038085 cliff fletcher i guess traded me to montreal because he knew what the city held for me we didnt have a big in depth conversation cliff just knew that this was likely the best place he could get a return for me
2038086 i didnt simply phone him occasionally to ask him about the whether in sweden
2038087 mats phoned as often or as little relatively speaking primarility out of a mutual respect just touching base
2038088 in telling me exactly how he felt about one day being a member of what we are building here i accepted his sincerity about his doubts i began to have a very good feeling about today happening when i learned of another teams substancial offer i was preparing to phone mats when he phone me the following morning quite early in it actually
2038089 when bob first reached me a matter of hours after gaining permission from toronto in june we had a very basic discussion where i made it clear that my emotions and state where in a flux i wont detail it i dont want to spend any time being asked about it ill just say i have sorted through professionally and personally every conflicting emotion you can think of when youre pressed for a choice not that i was being pressed per se but you get the idea
2038090 ive always been a person who knows what he wants to be at a place where i didnt really know required some examination bob shared with me his experiences with that how he had doubts in 1988 but none a year later and i spoke with several other former team mates who went through a similar crossroads and it didnt help really every situation is different and ive only ever had this bob allowed me all the personal space and time needed its part of why it feels confortable to be here
2038091 we spoke four days ago mats then calls me around the time we were all finishing our soup to tell what time his plane is landing in montreal all of you who think im a calm guy
2038092 what happened was i made up my mind i was vacationing when i decided and understood i couldnt fly in directly from sweden so i chose to simply to fly from where we were i called j p i tried to plan around some itineraries once i landed
2038093 there was some quick paperwork to be done no one who owns a blackberry is ever on holidays that being said few people knew mats was on his way myself mats two others thats all thats the reason mats has no jersey with a number 13 on it to display
2038094 my driver brought me here not knowing the reasons why mats was actually sequestered in a police questioning room for 45 minutes a question of keeping things quiet while i sat in traffic
2038095 fortunately i went pretty much unrecognized until we got out of the car here some horns were honking
2038096 mats made an offer we accepted it its a one year contract maybe longer we hope mats and i spoke of a three year engagement that we will address one season at a time
2038097 apart from being paid what i feel as though i have earned over my career the money was not a factor whatsoever it this money wasnt in my head all summer there was a nice offer at one time that didnt change at all how i was feeling that told me something knowing now how badly i cant wait to start playing its all about winning for me now
2038098 its a one year 5 9 million with bonuses attached two year deals have no bonuses to them as per the cba mats brought the figure and term he wants the added motivation
2038099 all i want is to win a stanley cup this city knows all about that this organization is on track i want one too
2038100 you know thats a hard one im not comfortable answering about the maple leafs sitting here in montreal but i know i will have to
2038101 let me put it to you this way i love that city its home i wont be living there for now but its still home peoples feelings there matter to me very much the fans love hockey they treated me very good you wont hear a bad word everyone i presume understands why i am sitting here now it was very very hard for me to leave there without having won a stanley cup in toronto it was hard all summer like i guess a divorce with someone you still love feels like i felt at times like i was abandonning them
2038102 i spoke with cliff before i called bob and cliff said i shouldnt feel that way at all he convinced me really and i feel like it kind of liberated me some i did me good cliff is a great man he wanted me back as well as i wished i could still be there but
2038103 ill be in toronto shortly for some loose ends ill address all that there and then i love that city the fans the team all of it im sorry we didnt win a cup itll be tough for them to see me in a canadiens jersey i know but theyre good fans and theyll get over whatever they need to in this just like i did
2038104 if you speak to players like doug gilmour or frank mahovlich or ken dryden who was there they will all tell you that the passion both cities have for the game resembles each other in a great many ways
2038105 first with the nordiques and more with toronto i know exactly what this city is all about thats comforting the atmosphere it should make my transition a very simple one
2038106 geez and i thought this restaurant looked cool i guess they forgot to pay their bills lmao
2038107 he deserves another go to show his commitment and then we will see where we stand at the end of the season
2038108 gallass worst moment of last season was his unravelling at birmingham city after the 2 2 draw when he staged a bizarre sit in protest
2038109 we had a month and a half after that game where our heads were not right
2038110 we have kept the basis of the team this season ok we have lost gilberto who was very experienced and very important in the dressing room also we lost mathieu flamini and alex hleb but we brought in nasri and also we have many young players who are one year older and have learned a lot

2038125 most of those traveling to beijing this week for the olympics have likely heard of falun gong and the communist partys brutal campaign to crush it
2038126 but few realize that the violence meted out against these peaceful believers has been so pervasive to have affected most neighborhoods in beijing including those within walking distance of olympic venues hotels and prominent landmarks
2038127 we realize the challenges facing journalists seeking to cover a taboo topic like falun gong but we hope this guide will assist them in overcoming these obstacles

2038159 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2038160 my understanding that the iraiq parliament did not convene on sunday however it has not yet recessed and lawmakers remain ready to reconvene once a new bill is ready for them to consider the iraqi political leaders are continuing to discuss the elections law ambassador crocker and us embassy officials continue to encourage iraqis to work towards compromise and consensus and to develop an elections law that will allow for provincial elections this year
2038161 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
2038162 a walkout by kurdish lawmakers over how to deal with the disputed oil city of kirkuk
2038163 we cannot have a vote with an absence of a whole faction the vote is useless it will be rejected by the represenatives of this bloc and by the presidency council
2038164 many observers believe talabani would stand with his kurdish compatriots and vote against the measure bringing it back to square one
2038165 the draft of the provinical elections law will be referred to the presidential council which will definitely not approve it so the elections will be postponed until next year
2038166 a vote had been planned for sunday but it was scrapped when lawmakers failed to agree on how the elections would affect kirkuk which minority kurds want to make part of their semi autonomous northern region turkeys nationalist movement party mhp leader devlet bahceli called on the countrys ruling justice and development party akp in a written statement to warn iraqi kurdish groups in kirkuk more openly and take the necessary measures in order to protect turkmens rights turkey who has historical ties with kirkuk has been monitoring the situation very closely and calls on all parties to reach consensus for a solution
2038167 i think we said something about that last week i believe and our position is that we believe that this now is not the time to be making such a decision we believe that the parties need to leave themselves open to all appropriate or all options in order to come to an understanding so that they can proceed with provincial elections this fall
2038168 the iraqi parliament adjourned its tuesday session without reaching an agreement on provisions in the election law regarding the status of the city of kirkuk shahied al jaberi with the shiite united iraqi alliance said lawmakers opted to postpone the issue until the wednesday session because lawmakers could not agree on the kirkuk issue voices of iraq reported
2038169 elections in kirkuk would also be postponed until no later than december 2009
2038170 a turkmen representative said a delay in kirkuk voting was unacceptable
2038171 the parliament session to approve the provincial election law has been delayed until tomorrow
2038172 the deadlock also prevented a vote by parliament on a 21 billion supplemental budget the crisis has marked the first time that elements of one of the most prominent shiite muslim parties the supreme islamic iraqi council have broken with the kurds their traditional allies
2038173 the book alleges that habbush saddams intelligence chief was in cia protective custody after the 2003 invasion that the white house ordered cia officials to have tahir jalil habbush al tikriti write and backdate the letter and paid him 5 million the author quotes two former cia officials who claim to have seen a draft of the letter on white house stationery

2038180 in another switch obama calls for tapping u s oil reserve
2038181 obamas revised position on a key energy issue was his second shift in three days
2038182 had met with economic advisers and business leaders in washington last week and they had advised him to call for tapping the government reserve
2038183 team obama cast the proposal as a refinement rather than a flip flop on obamas previous opposition to tapping the 770 million barrel reserve

2038191 she plays a perfect girlfriend but she has like 15 boyfriends and fry puts up with it at least for a little while and then he snaps
2038192 shes different from the other actors doing voice work who decide they are not cool to their kids until they do a voice
2038193 its like arnold schwarzenegger being a lunkhead to their kids until they come home and say guess what kids im a cartoon and then they are stars at home you know people like mel gibson doing voice work im more of a hero to their kids than they are

2038212 iraq is not the central front in the war on terrorism and it never has been i believed it was a grave mistake to allow ourselves to be distracted from the fight against al qaeda and the taliban by invading iraq
2038213 it has always been my belief that the victory of islam will never take place until a muslim state is established in the manner of the prophet i e a caliphate in the heart of the islamic world specifically in the levant egypt and the neighboring states of the peninsula and iraq however the center would be in the levant and egypt as for the battles that are going on in the far flung regions of the islamic world such as chechnya afghanistan kashmir and bosnia they are just the groundwork and the vanguard for the major battles which have begun in the heart of the islamic world we ask god that he send down his victory upon us that he promised to his faithful worshipers
2038214 the war continues to abate in iraq violence is still present but of course iraq was a relatively violent place long before coalition forces moved in

2038230 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances senator mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that

2038236 the department proposes to define abortion as any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
2038237 the issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives
2038238 to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers
2038239 respect for moral beliefs only goes one way a catholic hospital has no corresponding obligation to hire pro choice workers or accommodate their moral beliefs by permitting them to offer emergency contraception to rape victims or hand out condoms to the hiv positive
2038240 a crisis pregnancy center would not have to hire pro choice counselors who would tell women that abortion would not really give them breast cancer or leave them sterile only anti choicers apparently have moral beliefs that entitle them to jobs they refuse to actually perform

2038246 end the brutality to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
2038247 today we stand as a bold and prophetic witness against the tyranny and brutality by the chinese government against their own people
2038248 china also promotes the barbaric practice of forced abortion and sterilization while those who speak out against human rights abuses by the chinese government are crushed and trampled and the peaceful citizens of tibet have been brutalized by chinese leaders
2038249 today we follow the teachings of jesus in matthew 25 and stand in solidarity with our oppressed chinese brothers and sisters our public witness is a visible reminder that 100 000 military troops and abusive security measures cannot silence the voice of freedom justice and the power of the gospel of christ the truth will always be heard and we hope that president bush will boldly speak out against these human rights abuses on his official visit to china during the olympics

2038263 the fund can continue to play an effective role in supporting turkeysefforts to entrench economic stability and tackle its remainingvulnerabilities
2038264 many directors considered that the fund should be prepared to explore allavailable options for future imf engagement and several underlined the importance of close consultations on policy targets with the fund
2038265 some directors saw merit in continued imf program engagement with turkey inthe current difficult global financial environment
2038266 all directors underscored that political commitment to sound policies andreform will remain the key ingredient to ensure future economic success regardless of the modality of fund engagement
2038267 experience has shown that turkey still faces challenges to entrench macroeconomic stability and that disciplined macroeconomic policies will beneeded to continue reducing public debt ratios and restart disinflation
2038268 turkey would also benefit from further progress in structural reforms especially in the fiscal area
2038269 considerable external vulnerabilities remain owing to a large and wideningcurrent account deficit
2038270 directors noted that improved confidence attracted capital inflows and strengthened the currency this a long with higher oil prices contributed to widening the current account deficit

2038283 im certain you have many questions where would you like to begin
2038284 there is much more detail to go into but as you say long story short the society exists partly to explore strange and unusual phenomena and also to record and track the data resulting from the investigations
2038285 ufo sightings among many other things ufos and alien abductions are only two among dozens of paranormal phenomena
2038286 okay so what are we like ghostbusters or the x files or something
2038287 well a movie and a television series what you never watched the x files
2038288 no i spent much of my youth traveling i never had much time for television i suppose
2038289 well i guess you could say ive wasted most of my life sitting in front of the tv the x files was a show about two fbi agents who investigated strange stuff what did you call it the paranormal including ufos
2038290 i see well the work we do here is real science not science fiction
2038291 they may be and they may not be i do not know for certain
2038292 however i do know there are strange phenomena that are real so i am inclined to err on the side of probability
2038293 keith we seven of us are part of the society for many reasons one of them is that terrance fi rmly believes that each of us has a talent that most men and women do not
2038294 you seem a nice man keith but i have to tell you you are a terrible liar

2038305 it will not happen easily or quickly but at least it ought to be put on the agenda
2038306 we feel very optimistic precisely because the demand for nuclear disarmament is now coming from across the entire political spectrum there are people in the united states like kissinger who many people in the peace movement might consider to be war criminals who are now very actively campaigning for nuclear disarmament not just issuing a statement but actually going out there arguing for it working to bring people on board

2038312 many of these organizations supporters are undoubtedly motivated by a profound and commendable desire to preserve and protect human life at all stages
2038313 unfortunately the leaders of these organizations are pursing strategies that are counterproductive to their stated objectives this type of political rhetoric and campaign intervention is directly responsible for many of the failed policies of the last decade that have proved to be a disaster by all reasonable measures for human life and dignity

2038365 in march the mccain campaign proudly announced the launch of its national catholics for mccain committee a group that includes deal hudson and more than 100 other catholics
2038366 we believe the mccain campaign owes it to catholics to clarify precisely which members of its catholics for mccain committee are just names on a list and which members are engaged in the committees stated mission of actively recruiting catholics at the national regional state local and parish levels to help share john mccains vision and pro catholic message are u s senator and former presidential candidate sam brownback and ave maria university founder tom monaghan also just names on a list what about republican house leader john boehner and former rnc catholic outreach director martin gillespie
2038367 although the mccain campaign is attempting to downplay hudsons role as a catholic advisor and surrogate the facts appear to tell a different story in may mr hudson was a key player in the campaigns attempt to rectify fallout over senator mccains embrace of anti catholic pastor john hagee more recently hudson has used his insidecatholic com blog to issue a series of attacks against mccains opponent barack obama just this past week hudson hosted a press conference for frank donatelli deputy chair of the republican national committee with national catholic media outlets and on monday hudson appeared on the al kresta show to criticize senator obamas catholic outreach efforts deal hudson isnt just a name on a list hes one of the most publicly identified catholic supporter of mccain this is the same deal hudson who established a white house catholic working group which as he stated in his recent book deliberately excluded the united states conference of catholic bishops from policy discussions last year hudson publicly ridiculed a vatican climate change initiative that didnt fit his political worldview
2038368 we reiterate our call for deal hudsons removal from the national catholics for mccain steering committee

2038646 days of intense negotiations and heavy pressure from the u s the united nations and britain
2038647 the united states regrets that the iraqi parliament today adjourned without finishing its work on a local elections law
2038648 its interesting what i find interesting about this report as well is when youre looking at these two countries iraq and afghanistan seeing how vastly different iraq is from afghanistan in terms of the natural resources that they have afghanistan is a very poor country one of the poorest in the world iraq will come back much faster given that they had some semblance of infrastructure as crumbling as it was but something to work from afghanistan is being built from scratch and so i thought that was something worth taking away
2038649 i saw the report i saw the reports about the report so id refer you back to the state department just to as they wake up this moring just to make sure that theyve looked at it because i dont know all the details
2038650 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
2038651 weve done a lot for the iraqis just in terms of the numbers themselves
2038652 ill tell you what concerns me and most of my constituents you said many times the gains in iraq are fragile and reversable so my constituents and i believe that
2038653 you have to wonder why the best that you can say is that the gains are fragile and reversable
2038654 and i listened carefully to senator hagel and ambassador crocker from the answer you gave him i dont get the
2038655 you are asking us for millions more to pay off the militias and by the way i have an article here that says maliki recently told a london paper that he was concerned about half of them
2038656 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire cost of that progam
2038657 iraqs oil income will more than double this year baghdad continues to spend only a small percentage of its own money on reconstruction and services while it banks billions in surplus funds
2038658 between 2005 and 2007 only 10 percent of iraqs expenditures went toward reconstruction with just 1 percent spent on maintaining u s and iraqi funded investments in roads water electricity and weapons according to a report released yesterday by the government accountability office even when baghdad has allocated larger sums the report said it has spent only a small portion of the budgeted money
2038659 left little doubt that iraq which racked up 32 9 billion in oil earnings from january through june can afford to pay more for its own reconstruction
2038660 driving through iraq you feel the neglect here in basra the city is rivers of sewage destroyed buildings and bridges from war after war after war every day i pass by the same buildings destroyed years ago during the u s led invasion in my neighborhood in baghdad every day they look exactly the same a pile of rubble the electricity problem seems to be getting worse iraqis have an average of about four hours of electricity a day while there is talk of reconstruction a bridge here flowers planted there the people dont feel a change
2038661 one thing thats very important is how they are spending their money which is distributing it evenly amongst the around the country but amongst the different sects as well so shias sunnis and kurds its something that theyre going to have to continue to work out we want them to take on more of their own responsibilities just from a security standpoint but also reconstruction also if you remember prime minister maliki went into sadr city basra and mosul he offered immediate financial assistance to people who were living there under those terrible conditions

2038664 its really important that they figure out a way to quickly get that money to those people directly i think theyve made a lot of progress on that but they needed to do more

2038696 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers
2038697 we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means that there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
2038698 environmental change is one of the big challenges facing the world today these long term data on the seasonal appearance of flying aphids not only show that there are already noticeable changes in the uk climate but they also provide the knowledge which will help to mitigate the consequences

2039265 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2039266 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2039267 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2039268 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2039269 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2039270 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2039271 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2039272 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive
2039273 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small does not serve the world there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

2039276 the private development opportunities do not appear sufficient to entice either developer to say affirmatively i can and will do this for the budget allocated subject to these conditions in the current market
2039277 is just a number pulled out of the air because thats all the community redevelopment agency could support there is no way to get all of that stuff for 40 million they are going to have to scale it way back
2039278 it allows the public to secure value in the site
2039279 the reason for pursuing a master developer two years ago was to bring something to the table to help us do the public side
2039280 however none of these proposals offer anything to that other than saying they would look for additional money
2039281 that raises the question why do we need them if they offer us nothing
2039282 do you want the president the vice president and the governors to remain in office yes or no
2039283 there are small privileged groups who are resisting the process of change they do not want equality among bolivians

2039355 its right on the shore of james bay about 1800 kilometers north of montreal
2039356 it has a population of about 2000 but the territory up here is nine communities stretched out over an area of about 750 000 kilometers with a population of about 20 000
2039357 but about 60 of that population is under the age of 19
2039358 the people suffer from social problems such as alcohol abuse
2039359 in the last five years i have dealt with close to 30 suicides
2039360 so bringing your group up here mr smith and mr sonier and the two players jamie and matt gives these kids a chance to look up to someone giving them a hope that sets a level of self esteem hope and motivation
2039361 i started the wellness camp about four or five years ago and it was a football camp because i was a former professional football player with the ottawa roughriders
2039362 i expanded it to the different sports and added hockey last year and the popularity of that program was so incredible that we were asked back this year
2039363 so i contacted wayne smith who has been a personal friend for the last 30 years and he brought the young men to represent the boston bruins
2039364 once the kids found out that they had some prospects from the boston bruins up here representing the nhl they were swarmed
2039365 on ice they were all over the kids and they were interacting so well jamie and matt were just incredible
2039366 most of the time they spent on ice interacting with all age groups from five years old all the way up to age 19
2039367 they also did some off ice stuff up in the fitness room interacting with some of the kids and showing them some of their expertise and some of their fitness training regimes
2039368 on a daily basis jamie was interacting with some of the younger kids and i think some of the messages that he was passing along could be life changing messages for these children
2039369 and maybe those messages could get them to go in a different direction as they get older
2039370 i am very careful about who i invite up north because of the social impact that they have up here
2039371 but i would never hesitate in bringing back those two young gentleman they are character individuals and class individuals and if they called me to ask if they could come up again i would not hesitate to say yes
2039372 well i think more than anything they explained the sacrifices that have to be made to achieve your dreams up here for the most part the kids have lost the ability to dream and jamie and matt were just trying to instill that ability to dream again
2039373 that is the most important thing we try to teach these kids and jamie and matt were both able to do that
2039374 i know what the commitment of professional sports is like and for jamie and matt to take their time to come up and spend some time up here with kids that are less fortunate is a testament to them the organization and the direction that you are going
2039375 we learned a great deal about the struggles of this remote community and about ourselves
2039376 i was extremely proud of the way grant matt and jamie committed themselves to helping those less fortunate
2039377 they were model ambassadors of the boston bruins and they were able to make a difference in many peoples lives in a short period
2039378 my feeling is that we might be running into some tough years in terms of the economy not to mention that the growth of queen west is making it a little harder for new galleries to open down here or stay open
2039379 after working on my projects for ten years i came to realize that as much as i like seeing these spaces as galleries theres no reason for me to put on so many shows
2039380 the alternative would have been to just let the galleries go
2039381 one of the reasons were doing this is that i cant make enough money on my own to support all the projects this way money can be less of a concern thats a better place to be for me
2039382 im constantly wanting to push it further with less overhead and with support ill be able to do that and hopefully it will work out well for everyone involved

2039394 to conclude with a moving and evocative poem on the current tragedy of jammu and kashmir
2039395 politically correct politicians policy makers and administrators might try to tell you that it is not about religion but the fact of the matter is that it is all about religion it is a sinister design by communal forces within the valley to completely islamisize the valley by removing every symbol of hinduism and other faiths from the valley today these communal forces are preventing the setting up of facilities for the yatra tomorrow they will even go to the extent of banning the yatra altogether and the government of the day at that time will not lose a second to legitimize that ban none of this is new in past yatras many pilgrims have been killed by the islamic terrorist forces and the objective has always been the same complete ethnic cleansing of the faiths other than islam in the valley
2039396 some of you might argue that it was not the valley muslims but the political parties and terrorists who opposed the land transfer order and forced the valley folks to come out on the streets i can buy that argument but that does not absolve the valleys common folks from their responsibility they cannot always support these fundamentalist forces and then at the same time claim innocence they did the same back in 1989 and early 90s when they either stood as mute spectators or as vocal supporters while kashmiri hindus were getting ethnically cleansed as a good citizen it is incumbent upon them to raise their voice against these dreaded forces and stop this madness if they sincerely believe in peace then they need to stand up and reject these terrorist outfits and their masters conversely if they dont then they are as much party to the madness as the principals and thus need to be held accountable they cannot have it both ways
2039397 but let us also face the other reality of kashmir there are real people living there they may or may not have sided with the jihadists
2039398 the delegation has in it mehbooba mufti farooq abdullah and saifuddin soz congress who are root cause of the problem here we refuse to talk to a delegation which consists of these people
2039399 leaders of the ruling congress party appealed to the bjp this week to help defuse the tensions however mahesh rangarajan a delhi university political analyst said the controversy could be a potent election issue for the bjp as it prepares for state elections in several northern states
2039400 unless they are very careful and display enormous statesmanship it will give a platform for cultural nationalism and mobilisation in the heartland and deepen resentment and alienation in the valley

2039454 support the fullness of catholic teaching by using this years prayer breakfast to challenge president bush and senator mccain on unjust war and all forms of torture
2039455 the national catholic prayer breakfast is better described as a republican strategy session and photo op
2039456 the decision to invade iraq and the support for certain forms of torture are the two greatest lapses of moral judgment by a public official in my lifetime to host president bush and john mccain without addressing these concerns is offensive to catholics and to pope benedicts message of peace

2039470 consider how liberal government authorities like mayor gavin newsom have corrupted the men in blue by stipulating that police not prosecute public nudity and indecency at homosexual festivals
2039471 what honor can there be in protecting the public practice of heinous perversions and nudity in the citys streets the shame of pandering politicians is transferred to the cops who were intended to be guardians of the law and public order

2039473 one of the citys two open air celebrations of sadomasochism euphemistically called the leather lifestyle by practitioners

2039476 remember this is on the public streets of san francisco
2039477 these photos do not fit in with the slick national gay marketing plan to be sure
2039478 nevertheless the pathetic and debased spectacle is as much an offspring of the glbt movement as the current quest for homosexual marriage the latter radically redefines and corrupts an ancient institution created by god to order relations between man and woman as the basis for family life perverse events like up your alley mock any notion of right and wrong as the reckless pursuit of anything goes tolerance leads governmental authorities to enable and promote evil turning freedom into sexual anarchy while causing a breakdown in law and order

2039598 so expectation wise all we can do is write songs that are in our heart you know and that are where we are i mean here we are in 2008 and the record hole in the sun is where we all are right now this is the music were playing right now this is the music we just created this is the music thats coming out of us right now and so be it you know what i mean i mean theres always expectations and ill never be able to make a record that sounds like our first album dawn patrol or our second album midnight madness cause those records were made in the early eighties i mean its like if i did that i would be lying to myself because that would mean that twenty something years of experience amounted to nothing and no forward progression can you imagine that look at the iphone why dont you just make another iphone like the old one you know how about me make something new and different and exciting and lets keep growing you know that i mean and its the same thing with out music thats kind of the way we feel
2039599 i think so i think its that and just being fresh to everything and playing with a lot of different people i mean you know playing with the damn yankees and with shaw blades with tommy and i you know you saw us down there at macworld in january and just all those kind of all the different people that i play with man ive jammed with and played with roger daltrey from the who and all these people you know this is what my life is i played with ringo starr i did ringos vh1 storytellers you know i just love it
2039600 this is my chosen field im a musician its just like a doctor after twenty years of doing something doesnt just decide hey forget it youre not a doctor anymore no thats what you do and my chosen field is as a musician and ill just keep playing music i dont care where it is or who it is or who im playing for thats what i do and thats what ill keep doing for the rest of my life
2039601 we never even thought about that when we started playing and singing together we were just like okay this one sounds better for your voice you do this one okay this one sounds ill do this one you do this one and i think you know that i think that when we were starting out in night ranger and all that kind of stuff kelly and i were always such big beatles fans and so it was a natural thing for me to think that it would be okay to have two lead singers like john lennon sings and paul mccartney sings
2039602 we were doing it and kelly wrote the song about his sister whose name is christy and she grew up in a small town in oregon where they would just you know on friday and saturday night theyd be cruising up and down the streets or what they called motorin you know so theyd be lets go motorin up and down the streets and so one day we all thought that kelly was singing sister christian and i thought it was the coolest thing in the world because he was going sister christy oh the time has and i always thought when we were just rehearsing it and jamming it out and stuff i always thought he was saying sister christian and one day he wrote down the lyrics he said sister christy and im like what what do you mean sister christy and he goes no thats my sisters name and i said dude i thought it was sister christian and he goes no no my sisters name is christy its not christian and i said man weve gotta call it sister christian and hes like well i cant do that my sisters name is christy how can i call it christian and im like dude poetic license we can change it i mean sister christian that sounds so much cooler and he goes you really think so and im like yeah man for sure it should be sister christian and he was like okay so we changed it to christian and thats what happened i mean with apologies to his sister christy
2039603 we had just finished the soundcheck in rochester minnesota and we were going through the you know getting some food before the show and the lady that was dishing out the food for us said you know my daughter shes been listening to that sister christian song over and over and over it was right in 1984 when the song was a huge hit and you know the show was sold out and we were like well yes maam thats really great and she says say is that about a nun who sells dope to school kids and we look at each other and were like yes maam it is and then we just walked away this poor lady you know never destroy the dream right
2039604 its the hardest rocking night ranger record since dawn patrol since our first record and i think the fans are gonna be everybodys gonna be really excited about it just the fact that its twin blazing lead guitars twin vocals you know lots of big choruses just everything you expect from night ranger circa 2008 and i think that once people check out the record theyre gonna be very happy at what they hear and were excited about playing all summer and were looking forward to seeing everybody out on the road with us
2039605 it was a struggle for me i did my best to be ready for the week but clearly im not
2039606 what can i say the harder i tried the worse it got i havent got the focus this week im just not with it obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2039607 mission critical facilities inherently involve a greater level of risk than most commercial space because of the presence of both a constant ignition source electricity and a plentiful supply of fuel generally plastics as in printed circuit boards
2039608 it is all about how an individual owner or company views their risk strategy
2039609 most people would agree that while it may not be a common occurrence the potential impact on the business could be huge
2039610 fires in the data center typically initiate through electrical equipment or component failure or some sort of human error such as poor maintenance practices in various spaces or equipment
2039611 it should be noted that in many cases companies prefer not to publicize even the smallest of events within a mission critical environment so data in this area can be difficult to extract
2039612 glass in data centers needs to be able to protect equipment from exposure to extremely high temperatures in some cases 1 800 degrees fahrenheit
2039613 products such as pilkington pyrostop and heat barrier frames are classified as transparent wall systems and limit heat transfer in the same manner as a solid fire rated wall but also offer the same visibility as a non fire rated window assembly
2039614 each one of those agents has a particular purpose and place in the toolbox of someone who is installing it
2039615 the only person who can say which is best for your data center is a true professional installer
2039616 the hope is that you never get to the point of the building system discharging
2039617 but if the temperature does keep rising the water will kick in by itself and douse the place
2039618 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2039619 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the democratic national convention and with the obama campaign
2039620 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election

2039665 an irresistible force met an unmovable object in the negotiating room and the rest is history
2039666 free for all where developing countries were raising barriers every year
2039667 i think this small technical issue exposed an ideological divide between the members between a belief that free markets will solve everything and a view that sometimes protection mechanisms are necessary to stop disruptions to local markets and domestic farmers
2039668 tariffs may be the only policy tool available to resource constrained governments in low income countries to assure poor farmers that they will not be wiped out and thus to encourage more planting and attract desperately needed agricultural investment

2039670 if enough people realise how much stands to be lost
2039671 the credibility of the wto which is already losing its place as the central rule maker and dispute settler
2039672 looking back in history we might see this as a big blow to the multilateral trading system
2039673 the us wins as many cases as it loses and doesnt complain about about the ones it wins
2039674 the seven year old negotiations coincided with the full emergence and rapid growth of china india and other developing economies as important exporters import markets and self assured negotiators they now insist that matters affecting their own development and incomes of their poor must be taken into account any agreement that is reached will be substantially different from the current trade regime and it will offer a better deal to developing countries if not there will be no deal at all as these countries have effective blocking power
2039675 its because of the positions of the g 20 that weve been able to get this far
2039676 one thing that we can celebrate is that rules here are no longer made by the rich countries
2039677 they have to take us into account and that will continue to be so

2039694 i dont think were doing a very good job reaching out and attracting the support of young people right now and that is part because we need to freshen up the party a little bit
2039695 doesnt mean we dilute our values or change our values we just have to do a better job of making sure we translate that them into the modern generation

2039734 aside from the violence obscenity and negative themes the larger and greater problem lies in the fact that video games control many peoples hearts and minds creating a monotonous zoned out new reality
2039735 god family and friends do not exist in many games
2039736 activities like camping playing catch with dad swimming or just being a kid have vanished
2039737 while shopping for a new video game recently with my 13 year old grandson i previewed several of the latest releases
2039738 most were filled with intense violence involving killing and torture others involved witches and wizards
2039739 many parents do not have a clue what kind of gaming activity kids are participating in many dont preview the games their kids buy i encourage parents to know what kind of games their children are playing and restrict the amount of time they spend playing them
2039740 parents should place limits on childrens media use including when where and how much they can participate and we should be ready to address common myths that are often portrayed in the media such as the myths that to be worthwhile you have to be beautiful that money buys happiness that sex is merely recreation and has no consequences and that violence solves problems
2039741 theyre not quite as far away as people would make it out to be
2039742 people keep talking about how they were 31 7 over the three year span from 2002 to 2004 and the last three years they were 19 18
2039743 in the 19 18 span theyve had five games decided by three points or less and theyve lost every one of those you reverse that and theyre 24 13 were just talking about a field goal here or a field goal there i dont think this is a complete catastrophe i know people arent happy with that bottom line record but theyre not that far away
2039744 i dont think theres any comparison between this team and the one that was out there in the spring
2039745 they know they can do better and i think that takes you a long way they know theyre better than theyve been recently
2039746 with the schedule i think things can be really good for iowa
2039747 i couldnt sit here and say theyll be fourth i can sit here and say theyll be 11th i know they probably wont be 11th with the talent they have i like the receiving corps and tight ends i think if they can get a good running game going and be efficient and give quarterback jake christensen time i think this could really be an exciting team with the way things are lining up
2039748 the lhc is the worlds most powerful particle accelerator producing beams seven times more energetic than any previous machine and around 30 times more intense when it reaches design performance probably by 2010

2039750 by the end of july 2008 this work was approaching completion with all eight sectors at their operating temperature of 1
2039751 once stable circulating beams have been established they will be brought into collision and the final step will be to commission the lhcs acceleration system to boost the energy to 5 tev taking particle physics research to a new frontier

2039762 i talked with them a little bit right before i wrestled maybe that was something they liked to see that i was relaxed maybe that was something they liked where they saw somebody who was composed and relaxed before going on a big stage
2039763 he brings a lot of talent in the wrestling room and translating that to our wrestlers ability being a two time ncaa champion three time finalist and in his own right is very known and established
2039764 he has a great wrestling mind and he has followed the sport and theres a great tradition in his family
2039765 i spent some time talking with him at the junior nationals in fargo hes so amazingly in touch with who the tough kids are whos doing what whos looking to go where and he has a great mind for wrestling
2039766 i really thought for a while that was the way i wanted to go
2039767 i realize that could be something later down the road but im not ready to get away from wrestling
2039768 i didnt think it would be that way but i really enjoyed helping kids and talking with kids and giving them my perspective the perspective ive learned from the greats like dan gable tom brands blair coach jeff buxton my uncle john smith ive been around so many guys who are at the head of our sport giving kids philosophies from different programs and stuff like that every kid is unique and they click in different ways not every one adapts to the exact same thing i think i have knowledge of so many different styles and atmospheres that i can kind of see in the kid what theyll adapt best to and make big jumps
2039769 iowa was my home for five years and its where i accomplished the goals i set for myself as a young kid and its a very special place to me
2039770 right now its the type of program everybody is striving for and theyre just starting to keep up with them is going to be a ton of work itll be exciting coming back
2039771 we hurting man and regardless of whether you agree with
2039772 a lot of people even talk about the fact that maybe
2039773 we certainly thank the wizards making us one of the few college teams they are playing during the college preseason
2039774 our staff went and visited with them this summer and really enjoyed learning from what they were doing with their players we have a couple of former players there and it was good to get the players perspective on the training ideas
2039775 our players will really benefit from solving the problems that kansas citys professional players will present in the match
2039776 they will be in midseason form and we will just be getting started so i am sure there will be a lot of valuable video for our guys to learn from i felt like our guys learned a lot against the olympic team last spring and this will be another opportunity for them to be in an environment that simply can not be replicated in the collegiate game we will go there have fun be competitive as heck and appreciate the experience
