2190001 some of your outlook appointments could not be loaded sync is interrupted in order to prevent potential data loss
2190002 there was no negotiation there was never any substantive talk of what they would take
2190003 all of that was speculation from the beginning i think it was clear it was a bad situation in green bay and they had to deal with it any way they could
2190004 some of your outlook appointments could not be loaded sync is interrupted in order to prevent potential data loss

2190018 gt brendon and pam johnstone who are visiting from new zealand center chat on george and verna wards front porch in honeoye the wards hosted pam as an exchange student more than 20 years ago
2190019 theres a lot more country and open spaces and the houses have bigger yards
2190020 at home they have more small japanese made cars on the road
2190021 we worked it out and figured we pay about six u s dollars for a gallon of petrol
2190022 we see the u s flag a lot more than we see the new zealand flag at home
2190023 one of the differences is how friendly the people are and helpful
2190024 gute frau das habe ich ihnen vorhin schon gesagt au erdem was ist ihr problem
2190025 nichts ich will ja zahlen warum h tte ich schon was gezahlt haben sollen und au erdem sie bedienen mich ja gerade
2190026 a single system which is composed of several interacting parts that contribute to the basic function and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning
2190027 it has not been demonstrated that mutations are able to produce the highly coordinated parts of novel structures needed again and again by macroevolution
2190028 mutations do not create new structures they merely alter existing ones mutations have produced for example crumpled oversized and undersized wings they have produced double sets of wings but they have not created a new kind of wing nor have they transformed the fruit fly into a new kind of insect experiments have simply produced variations within the fruit fly species
2190029 how likely is it that random mutations will come together and coordinate to form just one new structure lets say the formation of an insect wing requires only five genes a very low estimate most mutations are harmful and scientists estimate that only one in 1 000 is not the probability of two non harmful mutations occurring is one in one thousand million million for all practical purposes there is no chance that all five mutations will occur within the life cycle of a single organism
2190030 mutations do not create new structures they merely alter existing ones mutations have produced for example crumpled oversized and undersized wings they have produced double sets of wings but they have not created a new kind of wing nor have they transformed the fruit fly into a new kind of insect experiments have simply produced variations within the fruit fly species
2190031 for all practical purposes there is no chance that all five mutations will occur within the life cycle of a single organism
2190032 is there some new creationist claim that isnt yet another variation on evolution cant explain fill in the blank therefore creationism id is true
2190033 all of the proteins had to be present simultaneously for the blood clotting system to function
2190034 your point is just as erroneous as it was the first time you made it
2190035 i need to buzz this plant to release the pollen
2190036 all of the proteins had to be present simultaneously for the blood clotting system to function
2190037 but it may be necessary to evolve an instinct for using the buzz behavior on plants
2190038 a relatively large amount of pollen can adhere to the bumblebee body because the bumblebee is larger and hairier than other bees for example about 5 times the amount of pollen can cling to a bumblebee than to a honeybee
2190039 anonymous are you arguing for or against co evolvability of buzz pollination
2190040 a relatively large amount of pollen can adhere to the bumblebee body because the bumblebee is larger and hairier than other bees for example about 5 times the amount of pollen can cling to a bumblebee than to a honeybee

2190047 we couldnt be happier moving forward with our media rights with longtime partner abc and now welcoming versus to the indycar series family
2190048 we are very pleased to extend our long relationship with the indianapolis 500 and the indy racing league
2190049 the indianapolis 500 is one of the worlds marquee sporting events and one that sports fans look forward to every year
2190050 2009 is the beginning of the centennial era celebration of the indianapolis motor speedway and the indianapolis 500 mile race
2190051 we are proud of our heritage history and tradition and we are proud of our long standing association with abc sports
2190052 some of the problems of todays globalized world could be eliminated or reduced by developing operational worldwide molecular design and manufacturing capabilities
2190053 tomorrow will be too late its now or never my love wont wait
2190054 its a challenge for sure and its certainly not the kind of racing that most of us came up with ok you know what i do hate it a little bit
2190055 we finally got a top 10 there last year it was 10th but ill take it some guys go there knowing theyve got a shot to win others just want to survive and get the hell out of there
2190056 back then there were only a handful of guys that you really looked at and thought they could run any road racing series in the world but now these guys are all serious about road racing theyve spent time in simulators theyve been to racing schools and theyve hired instructors to fine tune their performance and it shows
2190057 im not talking about adding four or even two more just one more would work call it the tiebreaker to see who really is king of the road
2190058 if you are going to truly represent the season within the chase you almost have to have a road course race
2190059 i dont want to take the blame for this idea if it ever happens there are some guys in here that would never forgive me
2190060 on august 23 1982 at 11 04 p m the world changed it became a better place with the birth of jameil il fabulosa
2190061 most people dont understand the extent to which talking on a cellphone affects their driving
2190062 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2190063 the bad guys are very adaptable if something doesnt work they come up with something new
2190064 users feel more comfortable surrounded by their friends online what could be safer
2190065 myspace employs a variety of technological legal and policy solutions to protect our users from phishing attempts
2190066 facebook is committed to user safety and security and is constantly improving the site to provide new technology to catch phishers quickly and limit the damage they can do
2190067 we always encourage users to take precautions when clicking on any suspicious links and to only log in to facebook from pages they know are legitimate
2190068 he s got so many people that dig him and his life is so much fun and it s different every day
2190069 it was improvisational questions and answers with host russell brand just like other promo guest stars ll cool j and pete wentz did russell joked about there being sexual tension and britney shot back i dont feel the tension the other joke was about no one knowing who russell was so she called him by the wrong name ll called him russell bland and britney called him russell brown
2190070 the joke of the whole thing is there is an elephant in the room
2190071 captivating text and appropriate images delivered with unremitting good cheer but still you are gonna die
2190072 totally cool all youve ever wanted to know about meteors volcanoes black holes nukes climatic shifts and weird molecular disasters
2190073 frightening fact captured in hilarious text the most relativating view on the end of things you could ever come across
2190074 this is a small number and it confirms that many people entering into civil partnerships take it very seriously indeed
2190075 certainly there is no credible evidence that lesbian and gay people do not live in stable relationships
2190076 we hope the office for national statistics will include questions to build on this in the next census
2190077 divorce rates in 2005 suggest that approximately 45 per cent of marriages will end in divorce
2190078 almost half these divorces will occur before couples reach their tenth anniversary
2190079 there will always be some dispute as to the proportion of people that are gay lesbian or bisexual is it 5 8 10
2190080 it is important that the make up of society is understood
2190081 since becoming archbishop of canterbury rowan williams has become a prisoner of the lambeth palace mafia
2190082 he now puts preservation of the institution of the church before love of his fellow gay christians and before the dignity of lesbian and gay people church unity is more important to him than gay equality
2190083 the persecutors of gay people like archbishops akinola and orombi
2190084 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2190085 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
2190086 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
2190087 the red cross cited statistics about rates of hiv and other infections in the gay community which were misleading because the infections in question arise from unsafe sex not gay sex and because almost all these infections are increasing dramatically in other groups which arent banned from blood donation
2190088 it was particularly offensive and unprofessional for the red cross to assert that
2190089 the appropriate screen ought be based on unsafe sexual activity

2190094 you know how many people came to me calling me gay cause i wear my jeans the fresh way
2190095 or because i said hey dude how you gonna say fag right in front of a gay dudes face and act like thats ok that shit is disrespectful
2190096 coming from chicago where if you saw somebody that was gay you were supposed to stay ten feet away
2190097 it took me time to break out of the mental prisons i was in the stereotypes of the fear of the backlash that i would get if you dont believe what i believe in accepting people for who they are
2190098 gay people theyre very talented and if they do something special in the world and theyre discriminated
2190099 ive flown across the world yall and ive come back here to tell you open your minds and live a happier life

2190106 it will be good to get in there and see what looks good and see what we need to continue to work on
2190107 i dont think youll see the best in either team from whats going to happen down the road
2190108 however there are a couple of things with this team that you get
2190109 thats not what our team does here so its a little bit twofold there
2190110 i mentioned yesterday that weve cut obviously the number of plays down from what we have installed in training camp here just so the guys can get out there and function in particular the young guys
2190111 they can get out there and function and theyre not worried about what the play is
2190112 i think hes done a good job with it but again well get to see him against different people here well see how he does
2190113 im going to have a lot of fun out there coming out and starting
2190114 im going to try and showcase my talent and let the coaches know im ready im going to show them what i got
2190115 i said this early in camp that there are going to be certain guys that make this football team because of special teams if everything is equal or close to and youre excelling on special teams then youre going to be the guy that makes this club
2190116 weve got to improve in that area from last year we think weve addressed it and now weve got to execute it
2190117 i normally dont get hit like that during the preseason till preseason games
2190118 it is what it is im not going to harp about it

2190139 the manic pixie dream girl archetype is largely defined by secondary status and lack of an inner life
2190140 anyone who telegraphs their so called weirdness so outlandishly is not actually weird theyre merely quirky enough to be vaguely interesting without having their own thing going on theyre completely mainstream but have one really big tattoo or occasionally sing really loud in the shower
2190141 like the magical negro the manic pixie dream girl archetype is largely defined by secondary status and lack of an inner life
2190142 shes on hand to lift a gloomy male protagonist out of the doldrums not to pursue her own happiness

2190147 many of the young new zealanders who went to sydney for world youth day got a taste of catechesis something some of them wouldnt have encountered before
2190148 for many it will have created a hunger for more knowledge the goal with catechiwi is that it will help people on that journey using the podcast format helps us to try to meet some of these young people in their preferred medium

2190168 we believe that our business was further adversely impacted by weakness in the consumer credit market
2190169 verizon can afford to stop outsourcing the high quality family supporting jobs that our communities need
2190170 its surprising because we are making good progress at the bargaining table which is the proper place to have these discussions
2190171 we are very pleased we were able to seize them before they were circulated to people in the area and possibly escaped into the wild
2190172 if people turn these frogs in voluntarily we dont have an interest in writing them tickets
2190173 however if we find even more people involved with keeping and selling these frogs we will prosecute at the conclusion of our investigations these amphibians really are a threat to nevada and we have a duty to seize any and all that we find
2190174 we were both speechless the only thing we did was high five each other
2190175 we both knew what it was theres nothing else that looks like that
2190176 sort of a prize we might get if we take good care of our wetlands
2190177 i think a lot of people think of jabirus as being one day wonders so people dont want to invest much time and money in searching for them
2190178 theres certainly always pressure and what we have to do is deliver value to the consumer
2190179 theyre going to buy bread theyre just going to drop down to lower value bread

2190186 she took them all in the mother too rhonda has given them food shelter clothing religion and the parents have not helped at all
2190187 we think this is a family court matter rhonda is not a criminal by any means shes just someone who loves children
2190188 im going to show the court that these kids were not kidnapped they were abandoned
2190189 we would never kidnap them or do anything to hurt them or try to run with them ever this is all over money
2190190 their mother came to our house and was stealing our bank statements because we have an account set up for the kids the mom claimed that she had the right to the money since it was in her kids name and when my mom confronted her and told her that she had no right that is when erica the kids mom pulled a knife on my mom and threatened our lives
2190191 we werent sure what to do then she told us that her boyfriend fiance or whatever he is would be coming to take care of us we werent sure what to do so we just took the kids and left in fear for our lives
2190192 i have had them for three years and no family member has stepped forward and to try and help so who there is no one to take them i have not kidnapped them my thing is that i am keeping these kids safe from the problems that have occurred
2190193 an incredible experience we constantly are you know kind of trying to pinch ourselves to wake ourselves up

2190221 jean kambanda yes to his project of taking over power and he was rather advised to ask for the opinion of the french ambassador
2190222 the morning of 8 april had been marked by the arrival of several ministers at the embassy they then held a meeting during which they fixed three thrusts to replace the dead or ministers and officials who had disappeared try to once again take control of the presidential guard in order to stop the massacres and finally reaffirm their commitment to the arusha agreement however they refused to appoint mr faustin twagiramungu prime minister in the place of mrs agathe uwilingiyimana
2190223 towards 20 hours 8 april the embassy was informed of the appointment of the president of the republic and an interim government the composition of this government was apparently in accordance with the arusha agreement since it provided for the allocation of the portfolios between political parties
2190224 the result of the preliminary investigation is that it is possible to establish the existence of a first circle of power called akazu in which was conspicuous the predominant role played by the claimant that this first circle of the akazu included people coming mostly from the interested persons province of origin and that of her late husband that the hard core of the same circle consisted of mrs agathe kanziga habyarimanas widow her brother protais zigiranyirazo her first cousin s raphin rwabukumba and her cousin colonel elie sagatwa and that this small akazu held the real power since the 1973 coup d tat especially in the appointment of leaders soldiers and magistrates to the main posts as well as in redistributing state property which favoured members of the akazu at the provinces of the north west of rwanda from where came these members that is why the claimant without having an official post exercised a de facto authority on the affairs of state that she had necessarily found herself at the heart of the regime that had become guilty of the crimes perpetrated between 1973 and 1994 especially assassinations of political opponents after the 1973 coup d tat and the planning of the rwandan genocide that took place in its greatest proportion between the 6 april and the 17 july 1994
2190225 she is possessed if she could she would continue calling for massacres on french radios she is very difficult to control
2190226 president habyarimanas family it is for the time being under protection of the presidential guard if it wishes it will be received at our ambassadors residence in accordance with your instructions
2190227 the situation led to recommending strongly to our nationals to leave the country the first plane with about forty french people on board and in accordance with your instructions twelve members of president habyarimanas close family left kigali on saturday late afternoon
2190228 we had good relations with a lawfully elected president and we picked up his family which requested for our assistance
2190229 it is strange to say the least to blame france for acting that way other countries deemed it appropriate to abandon the leaders with whom they had normal relations until then doing the same would have condemned them to death our traditions are different
2190230 those decisions to evacuate were taken on the spot between the french embassy and our ambassador who was on the ground mr marlaud and the officers of amaryllis according to what was feasible in the town that had fallen prey to massacres and where many areas were totally inaccessible the detail might seem insignificant but the telephone had been disconnected we were able to evacuate the people who were at the embassy and in the assembly areas and i say it here until i get proof to the contrary whether they were french foreigners of all nationalities the hutu or tutsi rwandans the embassy staff were saved irrespective of their origin and i find it extremely serious to affirm without concrete proof that there might have been screening at the french embassy between hutus and tutsis at the time of evacuation i would like to affirm the contrary on the basis of the information i have provided that those who support this argument support it with proof but i would like to say that it is really extremely serious when people assert things of this nature
2190231 the local staff of the cooperation mission most of them tutsis were practically all massacred some of them under his eyes with regard to the other staff of the different french diplomatic services considering the events and the distance between the buildings he doesnt know if they were able to be evacuated
2190232 in february 1994 i had been threatened with death by the militia at my home in gikondo and i had moved to the french cultural center

2190243 although what was released in the report was already known through writings compiling the report is a sign of taking a step beyond political considerations
2190244 but merely releasing the report is not good enough the report should be used to help justice it would be a waste of efforts if the report was kept without taking action
2190245 we will work with french nationals who are against the genocide to make a follow up since we also have the right as people who lost our loved ones
2190246 some french even want to know and make their children and the coming generation know how their taxes are used
2190247 this is a report of inquiry it is not a criminal file it is not a statement of guilt but on the basis of this report other things can follow
2190248 the country rwanda has travelled a challenging journey over 14 years and scored many achievements causing deep admiration
2190249 our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime
2190250 or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii and korea we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
2190251 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
2190252 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
2190253 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
2190254 in 2006 the cost of americas spying and surveillance activities outsourced to contractors reached 42 billion or about 70 percent of the estimated 60 billion the government spends each year on foreign and domestic intelligence the number of contract employees now exceeds the cias full time workforce of 17 500 contractors make up more than half the workforce of the cias national clandestine service formerly the directorate of operations which conducts covert operations and recruits spies abroad
2190255 if theres one generalization to be made about the nsas outsourced it information technology programs it is this they havent worked very well and some have been spectacular failures in 2006 the nsa was unable to analyze much of the information it was collecting as a result more than 90 percent of the information it was gathering was being discarded without being translated into a coherent and understandable format only about 5 percent was translated from its digital form into text and then routed to the right division for analysis
2190256 the key phrase in the new counterterrorism lexicon is public private partnerships in reality partnerships are a convenient cover for the perpetuation of corporate interests
2190257 the separate bookkeeping and accountability devised for blackwater dyncorp triple canopy and similar outfits was part of a careful displacement of oversight from congress to the vice president and the stewards of his policies in various departments and agencies to have much of the work parceled out to private companies who are unaccountable to army rules or military justice meant among its other advantages that the cost of the war could be concealed beyond all detection
2190258 bill clinton picked up the cudgel where the conservative ronald reagan left off and took it deep into services once considered inherently governmental including high risk military operations and intelligence functions once reserved only for government agencies by the end of clintons first term more than 100 000 pentagon jobs had been transferred to companies in the private sector among them thousands of jobs in intelligence by the end of his second term in 2001 the administration had cut 360 000 jobs from the federal payroll and the government was spending 44 percent more on contractors than it had in 1993
2190259 outsourcing as a virtual joint venture between house majority leader newt gingrich and clinton
2190260 boldest privatization agenda put forth by any president to date
2190261 a neoconservative drive to siphon u s spending on defense national security and social programs to large corporations friendly to the bush administration
2190262 every purchase you make with a credit card every magazine subscription you buy and medical prescription you fill every web site you visit and every e mail you send or receive every bank deposit you make every trip you book and every event you attend all these transactions and communications will go into what the defense department describes as a virtual centralized grand database
2190263 so many former intelligence officers joined the private sector during the 1990s that by the turn of the century the institutional memory of the united states intelligence community now resides in the private sector thats pretty much where things stood on september 11 2001
2190264 if he is going to start a war he is going to lose the support of a lot of friends in the west

2190266 eine rechte gesinnung kann ich bei danilo beim besten willen nicht erkennen
2190267 im here to report that tennessee and tennessee district 9 voted firmly for the post racial politics that has carried a new generation to power
2190268 merely states the facts i think the nation needs to know steve cohens complete record
2190269 these incendiary and personal attacks have no place in our politics and will do nothing to help the good people of tennessee
2190270 steve cohen has been very conscious that hes representing a black majority district and hes not a member of the kkk
2190271 voters are not fools and they can sort this out
2190272 offering 4 billion more in tax breaks to the biggest oil companies in america including 1 2 billion to exxon mobil a company that last quarter made the same amount of money in 30 seconds that a typical ohio worker makes in a year
2190273 is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon and senator mccain not only wants them to keep every dime of that money he wants to give them more so make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain
2190274 through june exxon employees have given obama 42 100 to mccains 35 166 chevron favors obama 35 157 to 28 500 and obama edges out mccain with bp 16 046 vs 11 500
2190275 spoke up against the administration and congress and senator obama when they gave us an energy bill with more giveaways to big oil and really no solution to our energy problems
2190276 i think senator obama might be a little bit confused yesterday he accused me of having president bush s policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it i voted against it had 2 8 billion in corporate welfare to big oil companies and theyre already making record profits as you know senator obama voted for that bill and its big oil giveaways i know he hasnt been in the senate that long but even in the real world voting for something means you support it and voting against something means you oppose it
2190277 against an energy bill that while far from perfect represented the largest investment in renewable sources of energy in the history of this country
2190278 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2190279 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2190280 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2190281 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2190282 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2190283 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2190284 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2190285 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2190286 i should have known that people would feel that way
2190287 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2190288 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2190289 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2190290 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2190291 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2190292 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2190293 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2190294 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2190295 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2190296 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2190297 polygamous or plural marriages or polygamous cohabitation are forever prohibited within this state
2190298 conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society
2190299 superior to the law of the land would permit every citizen to become a law until himself
2190300 regardless of any consent by the minor to such activity
2190301 we can do what ever we want we have the power and you voters are to stupid to react
2190302 he will say look here ive been in office for eight years
2190303 i wish that everyone would be responsible for their own cats and not discard them randomly but 80 to 100 cats have still found their way to me
2190304 congo wants to preserve its protected spaces it needs the best expertise if that expertise comes from outside i dont see why we should be reticent we dont have any hang ups in that respect
2190305 im under no illusion over how difficult it is the glimmer of hope is that we have a very strong team of rangers on the ground
2190306 fish some kind of grains some kind of cooked vegetable and salad simple but tasty
2190307 when im sneaking and im having a moment of decadence i eat toast with strawberry jam
2190308 a japanese chef in london that travels everywhere with me i probably eat more japanese food than you do
2190309 at this age you get a widening of the field as it were
2190310 people who have been taking care of themselves are relatively insulated from those aging changes compared with those who havent
2190311 my guess is shes maintained a balance or problems wouldve started to come up
2190312 i had a very large tumour on my left kidney and had the kidney removed
2190313 its quite a shock to be diagnosed with cancer at any age at that time there were no drugs available
2190314 i was told by my specialist if you want you can have treatment but the possibility is that it might do you more harm than good but the new drugs are very important in treating this particular cancer
2190315 i can only assume that the members of nice a very badly named organisation have never been in this situation
2190316 monetary considerations dont come into it i think its barbaric and its politically motivated in my view
2190317 lump whenever appropriate split when necessary and save your time and energy for the problem child
2190318 have we reached the tipping point where e resources are more common than print resources
2190319 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2190320 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2190321 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2190322 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2190323 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged
2190324 but she didnt get a fair trial and everyone has a right to a fair trial
2190325 the charges against the mayor are very serious and the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2190326 i sincerely hope that the mayors legal issues are dealt with quickly so these ongoing sagas no longer interfere with the important work before the leaders in detroit wayne county and the state
2190327 lets take it step by step i want my day in court
2190328 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2190329 im sure that the mayors family is going to be very happy to have him back home
2190330 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2190331 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2190332 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2190333 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself
2190334 its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2190335 im going to shoulder this remorse and guilt for the rest of my life
2190336 being on a database that can be exchanged throughout the world or hacked into
2190337 quien hay entre vosotros que teme a jehova y oye la voz de su siervo el que anda en tinieblas y carece de luz confie en el nombre de jehova y apoyese en su dios
2190338 porque vendr n muchos en mi nombre diciendo yo soy el cristo y a muchos enga ar n y oir is de guerras y rumores de guerras mirad que no os turb is porque es necesario que todo esto acontezca pero a n no es el fin porque se levantar naci n contra naci n y reino contra reino y habr pestes y hambres y terremotos en diferentes lugares y todo esto ser principio de dolores
2190339 pero el esp ritu dice claramente que en los postreros tiempos algunos apostatar n de la fe escuchando a esp ritus enga adores y a doctrinas de demonios

2190346 i remember when you could buy a fully equipped 65 impala for under 3 000 new cars are cheap junk that just arent worth 30 000
2190347 we called up to the platoon leader and the response was are they dead yet
2190348 we didnt take any prisoners they didnt have weapons they were just sitting there
2190349 we argued about it but we had to move we had to get out our units moving down the street i did one guy and then i just left went out to my team
2190350 the way i see it it was a situation where we couldnt take these guys
2190351 we called and asked what to do they said we couldnt take them were moving
2190352 rwanda is a sovereign state and we have got all the capacity to do what is important for us the commission is composed of a team of experts the commission of inquiry was as a result of public demand mainly rwandans but also some members of the international community who wanted to know exactly what happened during the 1994 genocide and who was responsible
2190353 besides these crimes were carried out against the rwandan people and it would be unreasonable to underestimate the capacity of the rwandans
2190354 the report should be judged according to its content before anybody can dismiss the report they should first look at its content we expect the french government to take the report in positive light and cooperate with our government
2190355 i see it i want it i click it i buy it i use it
2190356 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
2190357 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
2190358 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
2190359 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
2190360 giant characters cannot attack blocking terrain features two spaces away
2190361 this object acts as blocking terrain for movement and line of fire purposes
2190362 you can pin me with grapple but you cant see me at all
2190363 we are unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse
2190364 far from lessening my suspicions about official complicity it has served to confirm them why would the minds in charge of this final report engage in such deception if they were not trying to cover up very high crimes
2190365 fourteen points of agreement with official government reports on the world trade center destruction
2190366 i said what i said and it was wrong or it was taken wrong and now all this media furore
2190367 im not saying that were better or greater or comparing us with jesus christ as a person or god as a thing or whatever it is i just said what i said and it was wrong or it was taken wrong and now its all this
2190368 ill have a beer with him jay z one day and it will be fine
2190369 you you you remember when you were with the beatles
2190370 i dont know why but the sight of a cathedral always moves me in a strange way perhaps it is because
2190371 a life that is full of action and violence and work and wonder secrets and sex and love and heartbreak
2190372 my death the death i survived the death i am now living through
2190373 i get up get ready for work same as everyone else
2190374 thing is im not the same i get to work and everyones doing the same old thing babbling away about aliens and weddings
2190375 three days ago i died and they think im fine but theyre wrong
2190376 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
2190377 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2190378 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2190379 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2190380 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
2190381 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
2190382 its so encouraging and pleasing to see that result tonight thats what they did i thought our boys were absolutely fantastic in just playing footy the way we want to play it he said
2190383 we know melbourne arent the best side in the competition we knew where they were but it was so important for us to stick to our task and we did that
2190384 i am very pleased very proud and love watching this group of boys play he said
2190385 some people might have turned the tv off tonight but if i was coming to a game of football i wouldnt leave watching this team play the way they played tonight it was just outstanding
2190386 they could have dropped off after a big two weeks but something inside them they didnt want to drop off
2190387 it was a level we couldnt even match from the first minute to the last minute he said
2190388 they geelong used the ball well and they moved the ball quickly they were intent and the first quarter was all about them and it was almost boys playing against men bigger bodies around the ball better decisions kicking easy goals in conditions that were slippery
2190389 it was incredibly disappointing on a very important night for the melbourne football club they really made us look second rate
2190390 i think if you have a look at the game youd have to say they were he said
2190391 we were all ready and waiting downstairs and all we could hear was banging and michael eventually shouted that he was stuck and that he couldnt get the door open
2190392 david ran around trying to make suggestions of how to get michael out
2190393 finally a fire engine arrived and all the kids in the street came out to see it four firemen stood on the landing outside the bathroom deciding how to get michael out
2190394 they used a crow bar and got him out in about two seconds
2190395 i was a wee bit worried but my mum and my brother tried lots and lots of stuff and i tried hanging out the window to see if there was anyone i knew that could help
2190396 im happy i got out and the first thing i said was can i see the fire engine
2190397 the fire was successfully extinguished by the on site fire crew and investigations are underway to establish the cause
2190398 iains speech was very inspiring i think it will go down very well at the hustings and i think we will see him pull ahead as the campaign unfolds
2190399 i think he has as good a chance as any of the other candidates
2190400 he is as passionate about the things affecting the ordinary man in the street as he is about the economy
2190401 iain can be an inspirational leader and future first minister
2190402 he knows that the progress made by previous labour governments and council administrations are at risk and thats something hes prepared to fight tooth and nail against
2190403 i think many people in the party will take great heart from what he has to say
2190404 i was not even a baby when uncle bobby was killed
2190405 im extremely grateful that i can now come to tranent and see his name on the war memorial
2190406 i appreciate this very much and its wonderful that he is being remembered in this way after all this time
2190407 i knew all about the tranent connections as we have visited the local cemetery where the kilgours are buried
2190408 in case any other fallen heroes come to the fore
2190409 its been an honour and a privilege for the community council to host this event
2190410 we had talked about doing it for some time but when my mum was diagnosed with cancer we decided we should pledge donations to macmillan cancer care
2190411 i have not been on a bike for about 30 years and dont think i ever want to see one again after this
2190412 terrible road surfaces and midgies got you down at the minute if we survive the midgies we will be pleased
2190413 the guys are a real inspiration and i am extremely proud of them and what they are doing to raise funds to help people affected by cancer
2190414 nows a bad time to have a public consultation a lot of local people are currently on holiday the end of september would be a far better cut off date than the end of august
2190415 however i would encourage anyone who can do so to fill in the questionnaire and give their opinions on this as its important that a cross section of voices is heard
2190416 i think the concept of a museum in haddington is fantastic
2190417 i have seen the plans and the building is going to look great when the work is completed
2190418 we need something else in the town centre other than the shops the council buildings and the sheriff court
2190419 i agree that the timing of the consultation period is poor but having said that the john gray centre scheme has been common knowledge now for some time the plans have been open to public scrutiny at the council headquarters you can view them at the planning department
2190420 as part of our ongoing consultation process about the centre we have held a number of focus groups in the local area throughout the course of the summer we would like to extend this to include a wider section of the population
2190421 if people would like to attend one of these discussion groups to voice their opinions about the centre they should email us
2190422 there is no attempt being made to railroad this through
2190423 this seems a rather strange document for a public consultation
2190424 it gives the impression that this is a foregone conclusion
2190425 the consultation period is too short the forum is in favour of the principle of charging provided that the money would be used properly and sensibly so as to provide toilets and showers that are maintained and cleaned more than once a week
2190426 the point remains that these proposed facilities would mainly be for visitors residents are not going to go down to the beach for a shower so why should they be charged for these facilities
2190427 i regularly use the beach carparks at whitesands barns ness and belhaven and could face an extra 15 a week in bills if this scheme goes ahead
2190428 this whole exercise is whitewash and disguises the issue of car park charges as a survey about beach use
2190429 the real issue here is that council tax has been frozen introducing beach parking fees is nothing but a stealth tax
2190430 if beach parking fees are applied the day will come when the carpark at the law and other inland leisure sites including those which are privately owned follow suit
2190431 whenever the council attempts to hold a public consultation some people will claim there is a conspiracy afoot
2190432 the problem has been that we are served by the main line service and the trains passing through are usually heading to the south which has created a feeling here that what was needed was something more local
2190433 a major gripe here is that we cannot get back late from edinburgh and i would hope that would change
2190434 we also see this a first step towards introduction of a station and local service at east linton and reston
2190435 the majority of people who came along to the exhibition were local to east lothian or had a connection with the area many visited the exhibition on more than one occasion
2190436 this confirms what is already well known that there is a strong local interest in our own social history
2190437 a large number of holiday visitors to the town also visited the exhibition and were surprised to learn what a rich golfing history north berwick has
2190438 their surprise extended to disbelief when consideration is given to the fact that apart from a small wooden statue to ben sayers on tantallon road there is no commemoration in the town to this wonderful heritage no memorial at the west links to the likes of willie anderson jack white or fred mcleod no wall plaques on the houses marking the birth places of the likes of robert millar all of whom and many more were pioneers of golf in the early 1900s
2190439 although i am the lead singer of junk culture i am learning to play the guitar so its great to have an instrument of my own
2190440 we are a tight four piece and our lead guitarist oskar hay is pretty good so if i manage to become competent i will concentrate on rhythm guitar
2190441 despite the mixed weather the concerts proved to be a popular attraction with more than 2 000 young people coming along
2190442 we are grateful to everyone who shared their views regarding youth opportunities and concerns which will help us formulate a new youth strategy for east lothian
2190443 i want to go on a personal journey i dont pretend to be a politician or anybody with authority i want to ask questions as a member of the public
2190444 they want to know what is being done or what we can do
2190445 i want to visit charities that deal with these issues and go into gangs with the police to see what they are doing because im sure they are trying their best
2190446 both he started off as such a bad guy i remember someone saying that there was not a decent bone in billy mitchells body
2190447 he had a really horrible upbringing and that kind of shaped the way that he was its taken little mo and honey to show him that he doesnt have to be that way i dont think he can ever go back to being as bad as he was
2190448 its going back a good few years we had to find a way of explaining his badness
2190449 i did a virtual two hander with john junkin ernie whos sadly passed away now
2190450 that was really memorable just because it was the turning point that was the moment when billy stopped being bad
2190451 the toughest one to do was with janet the downs syndrome story me and emma didnt want to let anyone down it had to be so spot on
2190452 it was a specific subject we were tackling and we wanted to get that and our reactions right we spoke to a lot of people it was very difficult to film but satisfying to do
2190453 holby blue set new standards for 8pm dramas in terms of production values storytelling and casting
2190454 we are extremely proud of the 20 hours of holby blue that we produced but following discussions with the bbc the decision has been made not to make a third series
2190455 bottom line is this has been going on for a long time and this is the first time weve seen it raised by legislative auditors
2190456 these local projects have long been supported its not like this has been conducted in secret
2190457 it is clearly worth a debate on legislation as to how globally the program should be defined and used
2190458 i dont want to pass judgment on a certain project but if youre starting to do more indoor bricks and mortar projects that would raise some concerns
2190459 not that i wouldnt support those activities theyre good for the community too but at the same time with the lack of open space out there and the needs for funds to purchase open space we should not be using the funds for something else
2190460 i dont really care whether the soccer field is indoors or outdoors
2190461 outdoors is wonderful and preferable but the reality is a covered facility might be appropriate
2190462 arbitrary curved surfaces and movable parts such as the joints of a robots arm
2190463 the first attempt to circulate a beam in the large hadron collider lhc will be made on september 10
2190464 its been a long haul and were all eager to get the lhc research program underway
2190465 self what a great chance to talk about iraq with a member of congress you should go talk to him
2190466 the relationships that are formed between individuals from different countries as part of international education programs and exchanges foster goodwill that develops into vibrant mutually beneficial partnerships among nations
2190467 i have posters across the walls of my flat we even pooled in to get a small tv its the thrill of watching nations compete for medals
2190468 if india wins well drink out of joy if we dont then out of sorrow
2190469 i have a thing for sporty guys and its a treat to watch guys from across the globe going at it
2190470 im looking forward more to the commonwealth games in delhi because at least thats helping to change the way the city looks
2190471 some feel there isnt much to cheer about till india bags a few gold medals
2190472 unless we are rooting for the us or some other bigwig theres nothing worth making a fuss over its high time india pulled its socks up
2190473 he frank is not fit to be in the field of education
2190474 it requires a lot of guts and students might find it tempting but personally i feel du delhi or india isnt ready for such a bold step
2190475 even in colleges like hindu and ramjas which have hostels for both sexes at a certain distance ive had girls complaining of boys crossing the boundaries to their hostels co ed hostels will make the situation worse we arent ready and i dont think the scene would change in the coming decade
2190476 we must stop pretending that were in the 16th century they call students the future of the nation and then treat them like mindless juveniles
2190477 tia in second year at hindu is surprised at all the fuss
2190478 its not as though students dont get physical on the campus
2190479 it basically means giving the students a platform to have sex plus it diverts them from studies
2190480 girls arent safe anywhere in du the boys are rowdy and violent what the university needs at the moment are more hostels for girls
2190481 a sociedade uma entel quia e os nicos que existem realmente s o os indiv duos
2190482 o problema n o meu o para so para todos o problema n o sou eu o inferno s o os outros o inferno s o os outros
2190483 because he was an educator he had high expectations for all his children to go to college and they all did
2190484 he loved the ocean he continued to body surf well into his 60s

2190488 bring only cash as there is no atm in sagada and the shops there do not take credit cards
2190489 everything from good music to top 40 to a mixed kind of format
2190490 he and i talked about the possibilities of african americans going into business
2190491 the brilliant guy he was i knew he would go off and do things on his own
2190492 i had to fight with him over the bills like any other client
2190493 when i hear his name what comes to my mind
2190494 i know firsthand they helped a lot of people small people little people not so small people big people
2190495 i looked out and there in the audience was ragan henry
2190496 someone had reached out to him to sponsor the dinner and not only did he sponsor it he attended
2190497 to me that speaks volumes about the person not the public person but the private person
2190498 he was a great influence because he was always calm there was nothing he couldnt handle
2190499 no one at our firm knew better how to engender and reciprocate the type of loyalty and dedication that bill had with his clients
2190500 he wasnt the stereotypical tax lawyer either he was outgoing brilliant iconoclastic and collegial a potent combination of qualities that earned him the respect of all of his colleagues we are going to miss him terribly
2190501 the firm had a wonderful non retirement party for him in june
2190502 there wasnt anything he wouldnt do for his family and friends
2190503 his family and friends truly meant the world to him he was well known and loved in the carroll park community where he often helped others and was available to those in need
2190504 everytime i say aids is a black disease it irks everyone
2190505 whites call me racist and blacks say you have stigmatized us
2190506 whats more disturbing is there are so many people more concerned about what other people think of us than whether we survive or not
2190507 over the last five years the white house and congress have increased spending on hiv prevention treatment and support programs for low income countries dramatically at the same time that domestic spending has remained all but flat
2190508 i think its better if they think ill of us and were alive instead of thinking well of us and were dead
2190509 he played an instrumental vital part in the philadelphia rock scene
2190510 going to see this band that i had heard about called robert hazard and the heroes
2190511 and they just ripped it up they were all dressed in black with red accents it was a macho stripped down lean mean attack machine
2190512 they were playing their tight and solid new wave rock with the musicians in line behind their fearless leader and rocking the hell out of the downtown crowd
2190513 theyd move back and forth as a unit raising the energy of the crowd with each and every step it was a talented group of players and roberts songs and stage presence were not to be denied
2190514 i didnt really play guitar till much later in my teens i would audition at coffee houses like the second of autumn and the edge
2190515 i never got a job but learned about acoustic music by hanging out at these places listening to eric andersen chris smither jimmy webb and other great songwriters and poet guitar players
2190516 fought this dichotomy he was known for one thing but that was really not his essence his soul he was a folky rootsy guy
2190517 the stripped down acoustic concerts i did with my buddy michael pilla i thought these were the most rewarding and the most appreciated by my audience
2190518 the allegations are false and we believe the jury will conclude they are false
2190519 believed paramour was believed alleged to have had inappropriate sexual contact with one of the minor children
2190520 did admit that the incident did take place including her witnessing same
2190521 i think theres always something to say women have more to b ch about girls b ch about men and women and guys seem to whine more about women i dont really want to call it b ch sessions with women more like a gossip fest
2190522 i think men have a lot less to say than females but they complain about different things guys seem to deal with their emotional stuff by doing something but girls need to talk about it with each other if i dont have a good talk with my girlfriends i miss it
2190523 i think it depends on the situation and the persons personality not their gender id react the same way to a girl whos really whiny as i would to a guys whos the same id say something about it
2190524 absolutely we b ch too much about the opposite sex if you think youve got a woman figured out for one second youve got it timed just right
2190525 yes i think they do i think its just human nature for centuries men and women have been complaining about the opposite sex
2190526 i dont think its so much about whining women use venting to try and figure out where theyre coming from many men dont like details they just want the bottom line i really like to be upbeat and when im blunt it sometimes seems like im being negative or b chy but im not
2190527 im getting the baby and me out of here right now im coming over im sorry i know you have the kitchen torn apart people staying over a column due costumes to complete and a splitting headache but its black i have to take the baby out of here and i have nowhere to go
2190528 listen mary not all black molds are dangerous calm down just dont let the baby lick it for heavens sake
2190529 there are thousands of different kinds of molds some can cause health problems but most are allergens
2190530 if you see it just clean it off with detergent water and elbows grease now make it dry
2190531 to take care of them you want to make sure things stay dry
2190532 without moisture and a source of food mold wont grow
2190533 yes could be wallboard could be wood it could be anything
2190534 its a chemical thats produced by the mold only under very specific conditions specific for the types of mold that produces it you might have a dangerous mold but it may not be producing it
2190535 but you dont want any mold if you see it clean it off dont let any get out of hand
2190536 we do have brochure available that gives tips to homeowners how to take care of mold and when to call someone and what questions to ask
2190537 before they arrive at the markets these dogs often spend three or four days on the back of trucks crammed together in tiny cages
2190538 there is a very big difference herd animals have evolved to adapt better to live in groups and farm animals in general have been genetically selected to adapt better to captivity and farming practices
2190539 we certainly dont want to imply that livestock animals dont suffer they do but dogs are carnivores and pack animals hierarchy is important in markets crammed into cages the competition for food females in season and the stress of seeing other dogs slaughtered leads to aggression and fighting
2190540 i feel the momentum for change is building and the great thing is that its coming from within china
2190541 imagine this forum happening 10 or five years ago it simply would not have been possible
2190542 along with legislation we need to see a shift in attitudes and a change in our culture
2190543 there has been much progress even in the past five years abuse cases today always spark huge public outrage there is much more awareness of animal welfare
2190544 my parents eat dog and cat meat even though they know about the cruelty
2190545 they do not accept what i do they dont understand why i should care about animals
2190546 laws would help but those that want to keep the industry going just need to pay money
2190547 co operation is really important for any group working in a country as big as china
2190548 many children genuinely believe dogs have no feelings that they are incapable of feeling emotions or even physical pain
2190549 many hong kong people take their dogs for walks by carrying them because they dont want them to get their feet dirty and make a mess in their flats
2190550 one woman in mainland china who adored her little dog washed it every day in dishwashing liquid she really thought she was doing the right thing and couldnt understand why it was losing its fur
2190551 my wife and i once went to a restaurant and saw meat being sliced off the animals while they were still alive
2190552 i have not been able to tell this to a foreigner before dogs and cats cant speak but we can so we must speak out even louder
2190553 many shoppers who might flinch at buying a full length fur coat might still be seduced by a coat with a fur collar a parka with fur trim around the hood a scarf or wrap or a handbag with fur detail amp the animal connection may be less apparent with fur that has been shaved knitted or dyed or combined with other materials
2190554 the 11 accused officers listed below are adjudged guilty beyond reasonable doubt wherefore premises considered this general court martial of the charge covered by article of war conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman
2190555 the 11 accused afp officers are sentenced to be dismissed from the military service pursuant to article 96 of the articles of war this military court emphasizes that this judgment and sentence will become final and executory only if and when approved by the president and commander in chief
2190556 u nder military law only the president and commander in chief has the authority and prerogative to order the stoppage of payment of the pay and allowance of military officers without expressed instructions from the president and commander in chief thereon this general court martial will make no pronouncement of the matter except that no changes in the status quo shall be made those among the accused officers who are presently receiving any pay and or allowances shall continue to do so unless and until otherwise directed by the president and commander in chief
2190557 the law is very clear and leaves no room for doubt and requires no interpretation and when the law is as clear as we see in article of war 96 there is nothing left for all concerned but to apply the law strictly according to its letter and spirit
2190558 no no noooo oh it was just a bad dream i had a dream that i was divorced and joined up with a bunch of goofballs and we were calling ourselves the avengers silly huh
2190559 let me give you a ride it appears that kang as infiltrated the ranks of these avengers we are here to stop him
2190560 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
2190561 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
2190562 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
2190563 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

2190567 on 7 april i called the french cultural center to ask for help on the line i heard one of my immediate bosses who replied that i had to manage on my own during the following days i called several times without being listened to on 11 april i bribed a rwandan soldier who accompanied me to the cultural center it was guarded by several french soldiers i showed them my service card and i entered inside i found there venuste kayijamahe there was also one of his friends three other workers and a woman accompanied by her children whom i had pretended to be my family they were all tutsis the french told us that they were going away the following day and that they would not carry us with them that our evacuation was not part of their mandate it was unthinkable for us the following day they packed their luggage without telling us anything one of my colleagues contacted the wife of ambassador marlaud to ask her to intervene for us she replied that the french were not evacuating rwandans immediately the french soldiers took their vehicles and took away all their food stuffs without leaving anything behind for us i threw myself in one of their convoys they threw me on the ground we begged a group of them which at least accepted to drop us at the st expery school where were gathered the belgian nationals we remained there when the belgian soldiers came to evacuate their nationals they took all those who were there without any distinction they took us to nairobi and i managed to get a visa and i went to europe
2190568 i witnessed some harrowing scenes at the kanombe airport where the french left behind them tutsi partners of expatriates who begged them to take them along with them contrary to the belgians who managed to ex filtrate some tutsis in a small number the french did embark only expatriates they separated mixed couples
2190569 during amaryllis french soldiers screened the tutsis before the kanombe airport and pushed them back towards the roadblocks
2190570 i climbed the stairs where was colonel poncet who commanded the amaryllis operation and told him my problem he shrugged his shoulders colonel morin who was from the unamir and was beside him asked me not to interfere i immediately contacted general roman and the operation officer i told them my problem as i thought it was my duty to do so a french non commissioned officer intervened by telling me that belgians were not concerned and that it was a french problem it was on the third day of the amaryllis
2190571 i climbed above the airport on the platform and i went to see if from above where i was i could see the roadblock and there were bodies strewn at the right side of the airport lower down
2190572 it is true that in 1994 i saw images that remain in my memory and that i would never forget especially that pregnant woman that they disembowelled 100 metres in front of me and there was a jeep and two french soldiers who were laughing 50 metres from where it was happening and finally it is the two belgian soldiers with whom we were that routed the interahamwe or the killers it was at the exit from the airport when you turn to the road that leads to town once you have passed the depression and you climb towards the stadium it happened there for me i was in the depression knowing that i was moving from a jeep of belgian soldiers which came to my rescue because they were afraid and we witnessed that scene where a pregnant woman was disemboweled and between me the jeep of belgian soldiers and that killing there was a jeep of french soldiers busy laughing who didnt move who watched the scene as if it was in a cinema
2190573 i was at the airport producing a topic and late morning a canadian female colleague came back in a state of shock because effectively there had happened what i narrate in sequence at the time when the french convoy was coming back there was a massacre that took place under my eyes we therefore decided to shoot on the spot we knew that was not far from the airport but we were all the same taking a risk we asked to be allowed to go there and a car always driven by the french soldiers escorted us we were able to see that there had been a massacre it was a daily affair and it happed under the eyes of french soldiers without any reaction on their part
2190574 during all those days it was very dangerous for belgians to move freely in kigali i only made one trip to town with belgian soldiers who were going to look for expatriates from a lorry in which we were i saw the scene of kigali town bodies that were strewn on the streets lorries of the refuse department that were passing by and picking up corpses and remains some journalist colleagues who were accompanying the french soldiers told me that the latter did not engage in soul searching they all had helmets with music and when they arrived at roadblocks where people were being killed they increased the volume of the music so as not to hear the shouts of the people who were massacred under their eyes afterwards they would ask that they open the way and would pass very quickly to pick expatriates
2190575 before going to rwanda i passed by to take orders from lanxade then instructions at the emp special headquarters of the president of the republic
2190576 94 children from the st agathe orphanage accompanied by 34 people
2190577 they have a frequent buyer program i dont know what the criteria is where you get rewards and i shop at eddie bauer a lot
2190578 it included a one piece that said the forthcoming fall collection is inspired by paws up i took it out put it on the keyboard of my computer and sent an email to corporate communications with lots of links to news stories back when the resort was in the news for various things
2190579 what i want to know is did they do any due diligence
2190580 there are so many worthwhile places if they want to tie into a montana entity theres the rolling dog ranch they rescue injured animals
2190581 theres also camp mak a dream a beautiful spot that does great work for kids who need it
2190582 i just wanted to let them know that as a dedicated long time customer that i dont like it im not going to stop doing business with eddie bauer absolutely not but to my mind at least they could have made a better choice
2190583 why such a backlash from a few locals over a silly phrase
2190584 celebrate the spirit and beauty of the state of montana
2190585 the adelaide football club can confirm that one of its players was the subject of a threatening letter sent to the club earlier this season
2190586 the letter was forwarded to crows chief executive officer steven trigg in may this year and passed on to police
2190587 police investigations are continuing and at this stage there will be no further comment
2190588 the north melbourne football club can confirm that nathan thompson received a threatening letter earlier this season
2190589 the letter was forwarded to north melbourne chief executive eugene arocca who passed it on to police
2190590 the club can make no further comment on the issue as it is subject to an ongoing investigation by victoria police
2190591 please respect the privacy of nathan and his family as this sensitive issue is resolved
2190592 we have got the moonee valley criminal investigations unit detectives investigating a number of threatening letters allegedly sent to afl players
2190593 victoria police takes any threats made to any person extremely seriously and is investigating these matters
2190594 yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift thats why they call it the present
2190595 we havent mentioned it yet but well definitely look at it and talk about it at tonights meeting at the hotel
2190596 i think everyones aware of how good they are finishing games and last time they charged us down from six goals behind so were going to be aware of that but we think weve improved our second halves since the middle of the year and hopefully were ahead at three quarter time and can hold on
2190597 round 11 probably sticks in the players minds and i think also carlton have got a fair bit on it trying to play for finals so you add those together and hopefully our guys respond pretty well
2190598 it doesnt mean the end for those guys who come out we mainly want to see mitch farmer play down back fabian deluca in the ruck and nick salter up forward and we think thats exciting
2190599 tobys pretty critical to our backline its a matter of looking at damon white and bentley and lonie weve seen what theyve done over the last four weeks and theyll probably get another crack before the end of the year and well decide what happens after that
2190600 white has got four weeks to show us if hes a backman or a forward if he can play both it would be great get the best of foxtel
2190601 will tell children how to stew worms catch farts in jars and bake toenail cakes

2190605 this data was not lost by the bbc itself but stolen from an independent production company working for cbbc however we took the issue very seriously
2190606 in one skinny mini monstrosity after another pouty posh beckham can really wreck em
2190607 shes always had a passion for the work we do here
2190608 oh ummhhh no i guess im not interested in those
2190609 i could never do it myself again because ive done it once and it was really hard
2190610 when i heard the concept and the fact that i only needed to come in for one elimination round every week i said ok
2190611 i used to wear my glasses under my bedsheet and then get out of bed because i never wanted people to see me without make up
2190612 sometimes it is meant as a compliment and sometimes it is meant as a criticism but what it really means is i understand who i work for
2190613 i dont work for a party i dont work for a president i dont work for a special interest i dont work for myself i work for you and for the country we love
2190614 senator obamas agenda can be summarized as this government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more
2190615 we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
2190616 but hes a pretty resilient kid obviously hes quite disappointed himself but hes got a lot of good options out there
2190617 bens a good friend of mine and weve been through a lot of stuff together
2190618 there are many inconsistencies in alinskys thought which he himself recognizes and dismisses he believes that life is inconsistent and that one needs flexibility in dealing with its many facets his writings reflect the flavor of inconsistency which permeates his approach to organizing
2190619 i dont know bill the little white rat in the box can still walk why dont you add a few more jolts of that really dissonant tone
2190620 great idea the fella cant even open its eyes anymore
2190621 what are the chances risks odds and likelihood in everyday life
2190622 get a picture of the health of the industry overall
2190623 by comparison a compliance audit conducted by lama light aircraft manufacturers association takes 30 to 40 hours or more
2190624 our business model is based on operating single pilot and single engine planes at the lowest cost of operation when utilized in a network across a given geographical area
2190625 the vision is an excellent next step to a mixed fleet that will continue to provide personal service to our current customer for legs longer than our traditional 200 to 250 mile trips
2190626 the cirrus vision will meet the additional demands of the personal air market and will fit our business model perfectly
2190627 will he leave the octagon healthy i dont think so
2190628 if thats the attitude i had i wouldnt be where i am today
2190629 id like to end it in the first round but i am more than capable of taking it three rounds
2190630 ive had a great camp and have done all the things possible plus more to help my odds
2190631 id rather be on this side of the fence ive fought the best guys on the planet ive fought better wrestlers
2190632 his ground and pound is the best of any heavyweight out there except fedor emelianenko
2190633 but brock has a lot of tools to deal with
2190634 he was in the wwe that is the only reason this fight is happening
2190635 he hasnt earned the right to fight someone of my level
2190636 i always did dress shoes for all of the other companies that i worked for so i felt that it was my fort it was just kind of natural
2190637 that was actually inspired by my surrogate mom and sister who were both very hard to fit so i thought there have to be a lot more women that are having the same problems back then size 9 used to be considered large its quite normal now even 11 so i thought ok lets go up as far as we can size 14 knowing that there was a void i went on and produced the line but i had no idea that there were so many people that had a larger footprint that was the inspiration for the concept
2190638 i was there so often they thought i had an apartment there
2190639 steve actually called me he had this concept of the steven line and he personally called me to come and do it so i helped to launch that brand and i was there for about 3 years before leaving and starting to work on the concept for gwyneth so ive been around for a while
2190640 i think interesting styling like mixing metals and textures and i still love metallics theyve become the new neutrals and i think theyre going to be around for a while also there seems to be a return to femininity women are wearing dresses again
2190641 i like the idea of texture youre seeing it in ready to wear as well as accessories like croco mixed media seems to be selling very well at retail now its all over europe and were all inspired by and are followers of whats happening in europe that and the infusion of actual color everything has been black for such a long time its nice to see color be it for fall or any season
2190642 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2190643 when i teach as a bishop i teach what the church teaches in controverted areas it is my responsibility to teach what the church has said and why
2190644 he is no longer the rowan we once knew i dont know how he sleeps at night
2190645 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
2190646 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
2190647 in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
2190648 embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other
2190649 for people who are gay and lesbian we can give the impression that we are more harsh in our dealings with them than with any other group of people
2190650 that must impair our mission and leave them feeling rejected
2190651 its all going to take time my hope is that people will realise that on these moral issues as on many moral issues there is no one anglican solution
2190652 on marriage and divorce there are those who believe that there ought not to be re marriage of divorced people in church others believe that ought to be possible
2190653 there is a willingness there to live and let live in a way there doesnt seem to be over the issue of same sex relationships
2190654 in 1972 the american institute of psychiatry still believed it homosexuality was a mental illness
2190655 in 1967 it was still forbidden by law in the this country and there are african countries where homosexuality is a crime we all come from different backgrounds and scriptural understanding
2190656 my hope is that people will realise that the other point of view is a possible viewpoint and we therefore we can co exist
2190657 thats an assumption i cant accept because i think the issue about what conditions a church lays down for a blessing have to be shaped by its own thinking and its own praying
2190658 there used to be a generosity of spirit and diversity in the anglican communion
2190659 there should be a backlash against this fundamentalism that has been thrust upon us
2190660 it is contrary to the ministry of jesus and damaging that in the church were still fighting battles that have already been won in society
2190661 complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
2190662 oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
2190663 is a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
2190664 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2190665 i am made glorious i the sight of the lord and my god is now my strength
2190666 my recompense is with my god who formed me as his servant from the womb and my god is now my strength
2190667 there were only 1000 of these produced right how many have been sold so far should i tell those at my venue that dont visit hcr about it or will it likely be too late for them to order

2190671 if for any reason nobody takes up this report and no action is taken the rwandans themselves will not shelve it
2190672 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government enjoins competent authorities to undertake all necessary actions in order to bring the french political and military accused leaders to answer for their acts before justice
2190673 we are ready to discuss this report with the french government hoping for good cooperation
2190674 our phone service has done very well in new bern as has our internet service
2190675 weve always had a good relationship with suddenlink even before it was suddenlink
2190676 were very familiar with the people many of whom are the same people as when cox operated here theyre clearly concerned about the customer and continue to provide good service

2190680 the a2b looks very much like a regular bicycle except that it has some very heavy duty looking components and a wide center stem in which its lithium ion battery is enclosed
2190681 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
2190682 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
2190683 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
2190684 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
2190685 sagada is alive and loud not with city noises but with laughter and nature sounds
2190686 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
2190687 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible team on the field
2190688 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and we owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
2190689 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organisation forward in the most positive way possible
2190690 and its hilariously funny and choosing different options on different nights is a great excuse to get people to come back to see it again
2190691 the play contains great descriptions of certain social problems that have not yet been solved
2190692 heres a work from 1982 that explains a lost middle class to itself in a particularly smart and profound way
2190693 its easy to follow for the audience but its not easy to read the script with all those variables its the size of the bible
2190694 really about a woman making the tiniest choice but out of that comes these endings people die get married or have children and all as a result of this tiny ripple effect
2190695 i was playing a homosexual gangster she was playing a whore and i had to threaten her with a knife
2190696 what can i say it was love at first sight
2190697 we continue to place our relationship with rwanda within this forward looking perspective
2190698 determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
2190699 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees
2190700 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2190701 ive not been able to get any traction on this for eight years
2190702 weve gone through seven years of really really tough times im part of the 2001 class and its been difficult
2190703 if you look at where we were in the late 80s and early 90s crime was out of control
2190704 thats how we got 94 passed and thats how were going to get 08 through
2190705 if al qaeda came into the country and was murdering 50 kids a day we would have more money than we know what to do with
2190706 as the feds withdraw it is no surprise there has been a rise in crime violent crime
2190707 a good economic development plan for our community would be if we make sure folks werent throwing their garbage out of their cars
2190708 what about the black community based on their response we will consider endorsement of a u s presidential candidate
2190709 time of death witnessed at approximately 20 30 so its been an hour since the end of the last episode martha sure has made a quick recovery from having an alien critter on the verge of bursting out of her insides in the style of yknow

2190711 great i got all this surgical gear on for nothing
2190712 when they found out what it could do they built the church on top of it

2190715 people are looking for special prices sometimes bodegas cant give special prices
2190716 the sales have been down for the last nine months
2190717 its hard i think its going to be worse for new york
2190718 people are looking for special prices sometimes bodegas cant give special prices
2190719 take one second to think of the victims of mr hamdans support of terrorism
2190720 your sentence will be their justice your work is our justice and you shouldnt flinch from it
2190721 we believe that the notion of fundamental fairness would be deeply offended
2190722 david hicks got nine months then he was released he wasnt kept until the end of the war on terror
2190723 i dont know what could be given or presented to these innocent people who were killed in the u s
2190724 i personally present my apologies to them if anything what i did have caused them pain
2190725 its not over yet theres going to be another big downpour ahead
2190726 let it never again be said that a single vote counts for nothing
2190727 the fact that theyre happening at the same time is very unusual
2190728 were expecting a really significant number of vendors and visitors
2190729 sure there are some people who have cleaned out their basement but in other cases there are vendors who produce these products and want to sell them and this is a good venue for them you can buy literally everything from a to z
2190730 most people ive found only spend at the maximum 10 minutes at a sale people tend to move on theyve got a whole state theyre trying to cover
2190731 they have a passion of their cars and they want to share it with everyone else
2190732 summerfest has been a part of the community for 26 years
2190733 prior to that it was called heritage days and prior to that it was called smako st marys area kommunity outing this is a real community festival people from all over the country come back because it gives them the opportunity to see old friends
2190734 its great food spectacular entertainment and a lot of fun
2190735 we stuck with that with both kids good irish and good biblical names were just blessed to have such a beautiful family
2190736 due to the huge success of so you think you can dance my summer will be taken up by travels to south africa australia and canada to work on local versions of the show i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time to a new venture with simon fuller i have very much enjoyed my personal and professional relationship with simon he is without doubt a man of vision and i look forward to partnering with him on new and exciting challenges in all forms of entertainment
2190737 i will check out the link to see if there is an address for a donation for luke
2190738 i have already had many emails phone calls and comments on my blog asking where people can send gas gift cards i didnt expect for anyone to think i was being real but it seems that many of you want to help with my trips to nashville
2190739 my intent in writing this book as was the case in coauthoring unfit for command is to fully document all arguments and contentions i make extensively footnoting all references so readers can determine for themselves the truth and validity of the factual claims
2190740 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state
2190741 white house chief of staff joshua b bolten and former white house counsel harriet e miers yesterday asked a federal judge to delay an order to cooperate with congress while they appeal the ruling
2190742 the court filings indicate that bolten and miers will continue to resist subpoenas from the house judiciary committee as the bush administration heads into its final months
2190743 lawmakers are seeking testimony from miers and documents from bolten related to the firings of nine u s attorneys in 2006 after u s district judge john d batess ruling democrats announced they would schedule hearings on the issue in september less than two months before the presidential elections
2190744 bates did not immediately rule on their request the judge asked house lawyers to respond by next week
2190745 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2190746 w e believe that entertaining any requests for mr boltens compliance with the senate judiciary committee subpoena should await a final resolution by the courts in regard to my august 1 2007 letter to mr rove please be advised that consistent with the above the view stated therein remains the position of the administration on the question of immunity for close presidential advisors
2190747 for more than a year karl rove and the presidents chief of staff have hidden behind baseless and unprecedented claims of absolute immunity not to appear in compliance with subpoenas they continue to withhold critical evidence and testimony and to act as if they are above the law because they work at the white house this claim was rejected by judge bates after months of consideration still the white house refuses to appear or cooperate this continuing contempt of congress is another example of the lengths to which this administration will go and how it uses government lawyers to protect its actions from scrutiny and increase its power rather than respect the rule of law
2190748 we are exceptionally pleased to support the north pole 09 expedition
2190749 weve developed a reputation as a provider of serious products that stand up to even the most demanding customer needs it absolutely fits our corporate mission to support john and tyler as they undertake this extraordinary challenge
2190750 its a fascinating and inspiring presentation and we urge people to stop by meet john and learn more about north pole 09
2190751 as we as individuals and as a society face the daunting challenges of today we believe we have the responsibility to tell a more uplifting story we need more simple stories of achievement and passion that inspire positive forward thinking action rather than negative stories that lead to increased passivity and feelings of hopelessness
2190752 the delorme earthmate makes it easy to navigate the customization options make the displayed pages and information easy to access which simplifies navigation a great deal when traveling in the worlds polar regions we need a gps that is reliable and easy to use the earthmate is our choice we see it as an honest friend on the ice it never lies to us and records our progress faithfully
2190753 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2190754 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2190755 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2190756 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2190757 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2190758 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2190759 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2190760 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2190761 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2190762 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2190763 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2190764 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2190765 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2190766 we are made up of people of every conceivable racial background
2190767 suskind posts transcript of interview implicating white house in forged letter

2190769 im ready to go in front of senate committees and house committees im ready to have my moment
2190770 i once believed in this administration but the evidence of their criminal activities is too great to ignore any longer i am disappointed and i can no longer support them
2190771 top 10 lists but rather listings of 10 things within a specific category in the coming weeks look for lists such as 10 songs by coldplay 10 movies based on novels 10 animals that are not bears and 10 albums by members of the beatles

2190778 sort of trivial nothing out of the ordinary but look at all the people ive met i tried to do a good job you might say ive enjoyed it
2190779 very simple he wasnt much into himself or money or vacations
2190780 he loved his family he loved his wife he loved his country of course he could never talk enough about his job
2190781 he was a man who lived simply but loved greatly
2190782 people always say that wherever you go to college is where you end up living either that or go back home i definitely felt like i needed some new surroundings
2190783 even college coaches always ask why i dont shoot more
2190784 they ask if my coach tells me not to shoot sometimes my coach was a little hard on me which is to be expected because im a point guard but mostly its a matter of confidence i really expect that to come along when i play in college ill be playing for a point guard coach and that will help
2190785 no one in our firm knew better how to engender and reciprocate the type of loyalty and dedication that bill had with his clients
2190786 he wasnt the stereotypical tax lawyer either he was outgoing brilliant iconoclastic and collegial a potent combination of qualities that earned him the respect of all of his colleagues

2190792 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2190793 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2190794 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2190795 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2190796 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2190797 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2190798 its quite challenging that rwanda a country that is just recovering after a devastating genocide has set the pace for all african governments which claim to have been peaceful and having legal governments for long in enacting laws that liberate a woman
2190799 these bills are not to make women unruly like many think but to liberate women and enable them to unleash their full potential

2190803 beijing will permit public protests inside three designated city parks during next months olympic games but demonstrators must first obtain permits from the local police and also abide by chinese laws that usually make it nearly impossible to legally picket over politically charged issues the arrangement announced wednesday marks a break from normal practice in chinas authoritarian political system and seems loosely modeled after protest zones created at previous games and at many recent international political gatherings that have attracted large numbers of protesters liu shaowu director of security for beijings olympics organizing committee said ritan park beijing world park and purple bamboo park would be designated for protesters during the games and that the approval process would be regulated by beijings public security bureau

2190805 i heard squealing tires then boom saw the car flying off into the river
2190806 the first words out of his mouth were i was off to court to get a bench warrant lifted
2190807 there was a fellow with white hair out for his morning walk it happened right in front of him
2190808 he just continued walking he refused to be fazed by it
2190809 i still remember what the military did to save hundreds and thousands of human lives in abominable conditions
2190810 our efforts to bring back bilateral relationships have never stopped we have had talks but we still believe the two countries relationship should be built on truth
2190811 this marks the tenth jackpot winning powerball jackpot ticket the pennsylvania lottery has sold since we joined the game in june 2002
2190812 a big part of this hamdan case has been gearing up for the trials of the high value detainees
2190813 nobody will say they are small fry and in each of those cases the government will be seeking the death penalty
2190814 this was a case of a fair minded panel of military officers operating in a fundamentally unfair system
2190815 the fact that the military officers performed their duties conscientiously does not make fair a system which allows the use of coerced evidence is designed to cover up abuse and disregards basic due process protections
2190816 if this isnt enough to validate the commissions against the strident and unfair criticism i dont what would be
2190817 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
2190818 i saw crushing wounds but there were very few walking wounded
2190819 i feel so sorry because shes dead she was just a very good person
2190820 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2190821 thanks for coming to uni its really nice to see you
2190822 now you have something to do in your room dance around in your new lingerie
2190823 hagers shows including this one are very contemporary very comical and satirical looks at modern american family life
2190824 she has good characters and a good story and a quantum of quirkiness where her sense of humor comes from
2190825 its a drama and not a comedy per se but it weaves comedy and drama together which makes it very real and very accessible
2190826 i got some footballs from the onu football team kicked some and thought i can do this
2190827 we were very very fortunate to have two quality kickers like brent and ryan its unheard of at this level
2190828 to have one is a bonus but we had two
2190829 the toughest thing for me was kicking with a helmet and pads on also kicking with a snapper and a holder
2190830 i can go out on my own in the offseason and practice all i want but until theres a line coming at you and a holder and a snapper its completely different
2190831 i see things differently now from a coachs perspective as a player i havent been a player for 10 plus years and to go back as a player its extremely interesting
2190832 how players interact how players prepare for games differently those are things ive taken from the football field to soccer and i think o
2190833 each place will have one golf hole set up you can go either by car or by boat
2190834 in order to qualify you must play at least nine of the 17 holes
2190835 its just something different to do and it lasts all day
2190836 there are all these other great players and im the one getting hounded
2190837 the common thought is that terrelle can do such extraordinary things at times that you might want to utilize those things in the right situations
2190838 but exactly how it will shake out weve got about another 24 practices to figure that out
2190839 im just working as hard as possible just to get some playing time get some plays in the running game and throw a couple times a game thats all im really looking for
2190840 you cant just come in hop into college and think youre going to take over and start throwing the ball all over the place and making plays its just not going to happen
2190841 if you watch drills he throws it maybe even better than i thought he would
2190842 now when you get into the group things and hes trying to figure out the coverage it slows down his release a little bit he has still shown a good ability to make decisions but we havent seen him out there when the game is live
2190843 its obvious its well overdue for a rewrite im hopeful that future commissions wont have to go into the depth we will
2190844 i just want to make a public request for it
2190845 we are absolutely thrilled and delighted to be bringing in a top quality player of jeremys stature
2190846 he will be a great acquisition and he will be extremely good in helping the continued development of our young players
2190847 this signing outlines our intentions smith can play half back and has a fine kicking game
2190848 hes excited to be joining salford and to be playing super league
2190849 its a new challenge for him and were delighted to be bringing him onboard
2190850 going into super league means taking another huge step its a massive rise in standards and this is enormous
2190851 hooking is one of the hardest jobs in the modern game in terms of energy levels
2190852 we came here to play baseball nothing was easy for us this year this year we had to overcome a lot and we persevered and i commend them for a great season
2190853 i think we all came together and we beat some quality ballclubs at the end
2190854 it seemed like everyone played with a little more passion and enthusiasm toward the end we were able to put some good games together and some pitchers had some big games and everyone played a little harder and we had some big wins
2190855 i think the way we stood the final week just to get into the tournament was a positive obviously we wanted to get to friday it didnt work out that way
2190856 i dont think ive done it pitch on three days rest since high school
2190857 i was a little fatigued and didnt have my best stuff luckily the guys made the plays behind me
2190858 i was pounding the strike zone and i was able to throw the curve for a strike whenever i wanted to

2190945 you and i have shared some significant trials and tribulations
2190946 this is the only real estate where lincoln and washington actually intersected
2190947 kids in high school need to know about that through the examples of washington and lincoln they need to think of what changes they can make in the world
2190948 i think i learned more in these couple of weeks than ive learned in three years of history classes
2190949 what can the declaration of independence tell us about life in 2008
2190950 there was nothing civil about it at all a house divided surely will fall

2190965 most kids will be returning to school in last years duds
2190966 the consumer is taking the mindset that if i dont need it today then i am not going to buy it
2190967 department stores are going to have to have the right incentives to get customers into the store
2190968 with the end of the stimulus checks we know consumers are spending more cautiously and we continue to see a pronounced paycheck cycle at the end of the month
2190969 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2190970 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint
2190971 that introduced huge amounts of radioactive carbon into the atmosphere and subsequently us
2190972 they said we should go smoke some weed and were talking about being in a strip bar some really explicit things

2190974 this is the first time that we have found a completely preserved chariot in bulgaria
2190975 anyways uh i always work under the theory that once they start blooming you want to remove as much stress as possible
2190976 its just like if you feel good you want to run that extra mile
2190977 i think you almost have to be at a genius level to do what hes done youve got to be thinking 24 hours a day
2190978 you just hope that some of what he does spills over and applies to your operation
2190979 i think theres a certain degree of fibbing that takes place
2190980 i played college athletics and i think farming is more competitive
2190981 as you can see winds of plague shows get crazy
2190982 the next logical progression in nu metal death pop and locking
2190983 and the crowd gazed upon lars ulrich as he tried to devour the dollar symbol theyd cleverly placed around his neck as he bounded and twirled in his new pants made from the broken dreams of hundreds of gen x metal heads blissfully unaware that he could use his hands for anything other than air drumming to triviums
2190984 you look like the business end of a sheep on juggalo drink free nite
2190985 i have talked with smiths agent to see whats happening and to confirm we are interested the talks are on going smith is a fine player and is keen to play in super league from what we have been told
2190986 we are looking for top quality players and he obviously fits the bill he is a top international
2190987 cristiano has four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully he will extend it
2190988 he is happy at manchester united and hopefully as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more
2190989 it does happen to players at this club they end up never wanting to leave
2190990 look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds united now he is a real manchester united person he loves the club
2190991 it is no different leaving london for manchester than portugal you come north you come to a colder climate you come to a wetter climate
2190992 but you also come to a real football city there are very few cities like that
2190993 his interview was very good and from my perspective he has explained himself perfectly
2190994 he is happy to be a manchester united player he always has been it is just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him however the matter is now closed
2190995 i think real madrid know they are dealing with a different animal now
2190996 i cant deny it was important for us as a club to keep him
2190997 there are very few players who have left me against my will
2190998 it is unusual for anyone to really want to leave manchester united and i think cristiano understands that too
2190999 we had a good meeting in portugal this summer we clarified a lot of things and i was pleased with the way it went that is why i was confident everything would be okay
2191000 it took us some time to get into the game but we had a lot of youngsters out on the field and they did really well
2191001 i think many people may not be aware of all the ways visual computing intersects a phenomenon like nascar from video games to how the cars are designed to the professional simulations the drivers use to tune up between races to the graphics overlay on the nascar race television broadcasts visual computing plays many amazing enabling roles in nascar whether youre a nascar race fan or not i think nvision attendees will find kyles session to be a must see event
2191002 there has been interest shown but he played well and i am pleased with him
2191003 there will always be speculation surrounding good players like him he has had no contact with spurs
2191004 there is no truth in the rumour that he is looking to sell i have been assured of that most recent 2 of 139 user comments eric dutch 33 and still here
2191005 were glad its over its been a distracting expensive process
2191006 we have a mandate to move forward and implement a real fundamental change in the business model were excited
2191007 the support that management and the slate received increased amongst the shareholders not only did we see a bigger turnout we also saw an increase in the support for management and its slate
2191008 that we have a mandate from our shareholders to move the company forward
2191009 that 50 per cent of shareholders represented voted for the companys slate of directors 25 per cent voted against it and 25 per cent did not vote

2191027 sure i want to play but im still a team player i want to go and win a super bowl thats a once in a lifetime opportunity im behind him and the team 100 percent
2191028 you kind of have that mentality of only watching but at the same time you have to be ready to play all the time
2191029 hopefully ill have a long career and plenty of opportunity to play im not real concerned with it right now i just try to stay focused on what my goals are and all my goals are still in view
2191030 the only worry for me is getting enough playing time to where you can transfer it over to the field
2191031 thats why the preseason is so important to me because thats my opportunity to get out there and play
2191032 i feel a lot better than at this time last season im very confident about tonight and the group im with looking to put some points on the board it was pretty rattling last year but at the same time once you get out there its just 22 guys playing football regardless of what the circumstances are i feel like i did pretty well but obviously i think i can do better things this year
2191033 thats what hes gonna do visit a doctor in arkansas yesterday again its a personal situation
2191034 i know shawn came out publicly and gave you guys a statement and thats what it is were working with him on it theres a personal side to things and youve got to take care of business and thats what hes doing right now its very important that he does that and gets that part of his life taken care of
2191035 hell be in there a little bit hell have an opportunity hell work in on certain plays with the ones theyre not plays that are designed for him but hell work in that group of players
2191036 right now im a defensive tackle ive got to go out there and ive got to play against the run and ive got to play against the pass and ive got to play special teams
2191037 thats what ive got to do every phase of the game thats what im ready to do i think everything needs work ive just got to go out there and do everything right now
2191038 i used to be slow but then i took crazy water crystals and it blew the bejesus out of my lazy colon
2191039 so the employment bloke asked about my last job and i told him james and i was working as footmen for his lordship one day his lordship was working with his prize roses and stuck his finger on a thorn and a mighty uproar there was about it the next morning her ladyship came down to breakfast and said good morning darling and how is my darlings little prick well i larfed and james farted and here we are
2191040 in an age when it was difficult to shine geraldine bruno was remembered for one event in kindergarten

2191056 you go to the cashier on saturday and pick up your pay
2191057 i turned up and there was so much money i couldnt even carry it
2191058 politicians who choose to use profanity leave the impression that their vocabulary is lacking that they are incapable of choosing proper less vulgar words to express their emotions
2191059 im a fairly passionate person about certain things and the death of a child is tremendously difficult i said some pretty kind of rough things during the time of the sgt stephen liczbinski death as well
2191060 i wanted people to understand just how serious i was about this particular situation
2191061 now you have right in the heart of coal country the beginning of the solar century
2191062 it couldnt happen at a better time it couldnt be a bigger vote of confidence for pennsylvanias alternative energy policies
2191063 to think that were still sitting on probably 300 to 500 years of coal reserves it just shows that were trying to be innovative
2191064 the legacy of coal was one that when they left they left the scarred landscape behind as well
2191065 it was difficult to get anybody to take a second look at carbon county
2191066 the reality is we are putting the nuts and bolts together on the states entire energy package but that will come to fruition
2191067 just a commitment letter from the governor would suffice for the company to get the proper financing to make this thing work
2191068 what were doing fits hand in glove with the requirements
2191069 ive been wearing a brace getting a lot of physio therapy done and it gets better but you hit one of those shots out of the rough and its back to square one
2191070 you cant give it a hundred percent sometimes especially when it starts hurting and your focus goes on the pain instead of worrying about hey i need to make this putt maybe it helps that way ive been fortunate
2191071 he was supposed to win the gold because he had won the commonwealth games that year and the asian games
2191072 he thought he was going too fast i think it was a management error by him
2191073 im starting to feel very comfortable playing in the big events where before i had a bit of a problem
2191074 i tried too hard and sort of pushed it too much so i always made a lot of mistakes this year both the swing is better i definitely feel a lot calmer more and more sort of content with life in general i would say
2191075 the fairways are narrow and if you miss the fairways by a foot you are worse off than if you miss by 20 yards which you need to take different peoples opinions as to whether that is fair it is a difficult course anyway with the greens and the pin positions to protect it im not sure you need rough as long as it is and you certainly dont need to sweep it back toward the tee the night before the tournament i think the u s open at torrey pines was set up perfectly
2191076 some white haired dude featured me in his commercial so i guess that means now im in the race
2191077 but ill just have to change the white house pink
2191078 the internet has become the news destination of choice for many sophisticated consumers and newspaper companies continue to meet their evolving demands
2191079 the latest audience figures provide further evidence that newspapers digital properties deliver highly accurate and hyper local content that consumers cant find anywhere else
2191080 with newspaper sales staffs placing an unprecedented emphasis on digital advertising newspapermedia com offers the information they need to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mediums multi platform offerings
2191081 we have loaded the site with the latest data and research captivating slides for presentations and a section on advertising ideas that have proven highly effective
2191082 what we did is we have taken a process throughout the years of judging cases on their merits
2191083 things like taking the word of the players i would do that again
2191084 a lot of them actually dont get into the press but ive got to take the players words
2191085 the scenario when you look one of your key players and then two of your key players in the eye and say this is what weve heard we need you to tell us honestly the truth so we can deal with this and they lie i would do it again
2191086 i think we dealt with a really difficult situation as best we could
2191087 maybe our past players are too honest and maybe our present players need to be a bit more honest
2191088 it was difficult to get the kids excited at first with yet another ngos hiv sensitization campaign once they realized their voices would be heard across the country they got excited
2191089 reengage existing peer health groups and get teachers to start thinking about health and sexual education

2191128 long ago i stole those records from my mom because it seemed like no one cared but me
2191129 i got a guitar and then three months later i bought one of those little four track portable studios
2191130 so i started writing songs the same time i was learning to play guitar
2191131 the last song on days gone by kind of reminds me of something he would do

2191142 the telecommunications market in canada is dynamic choice is available

2191153 it very quickly moved away from a burglary into a definite sexual case which led us to seize exhibits that gave us further offences which were filmed on video
2191154 a rape allegation was made which was also connected to the video incidents of children and adults being filmed on a toilet using the toilet
2191155 when i saw the evidence i thought i cant believe it it really just took me ages to believe it

2191158 la cooperativa est integrada por chicas que han empezado a ser descartadas por el sistema de la prostituci n porque tienen determinada edad
2191159 es poder rescatar a chicas que no ingresaron al c rculo de la prostituci n que tienen 12 o 13 a os
2191160 la idea es que dentro de un a o este grupo empiece con la producci n que otras treinta chicas arranquen con la capacitaci n y este sistema se mantenga as durante al menos cinco a os
2191161 articular a varios compartimentos estancos del estado para un objetivo com n
2191162 en grandes cantidades a hoteles o al mismo estado para hospitales o asilos de ancianos
2191163 una vez que logremos sustentabilidad econ mica empezaremos a volar porque las chicas tienen m s ganas de hacer ropa interior o alta costura que s banas pero antes de nada tenemos que estar diestras con un producto para salir a competir
2191164 cada chica va a trabajar las horas necesarias por un precio justo
2191165 el impacto social m s exitoso de este proyecto ser a hacerle entender a la gente y a las mismas chicas que la prostituci n no es nuestro lugar natural que podemos buscar otras alternativas que conllevan esfuerzo y trabajo tambi n y vale la pena intentarlo
2191166 en lugares donde podr a haber sucedido antes como estados unidos o europa que tienen impuesto un sistema de concepciones mucho m s ajustado y tiene que ver con estrategias individuales
2191167 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2191168 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2191169 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2191170 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2191171 we reserved all our rights to appeal and thats what we intend to do is make an appeal
2191172 wrestling with different articles of faith from boroughs to infrastructure and balancing historical analysis with contemporary critique
2191173 he was swirling around doing five things at one time he got ten times done what most people do in one day he just worked so hard
2191174 its been a huge honor to get back with my old friends
2191175 the triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other not to say it hasnt crossed my mind
2191176 i can probably get one of our designers to come round early next week
2191177 no i want you to come round and size things up
2191178 yes it would be a shame to rip this kitchen out wouldnt it so youll be pleased to know that im not going to
2191179 i do hope that bulge means youre please to see me
2191180 i could tell you were a big boy but that is impressive
2191181 your trousers are too tight and im good with bulges
2191182 its great to get a goal not only personally but to get a win
2191183 now we have to go against holland then nigeria i couldnt be happier the guys couldnt be happier peter nowak the coach couldnt be happier
2191184 its the end of my career and its not the way i planned it
2191185 itll be nice to have him here to console me maybe i can console him
2191186 you get to an age in your career where youre more likely to get hurt were not invincible
2191187 a girl is just under the limit now and 4 years later where is she
2191188 where would the sport be without nadia where would the sport be without olga
2191189 if somebody asked me a question i answered it but im focused on getting better im more worried about how im doing on the practice field than whats going on elsewhere
2191190 some people thought i shouldve been mad when they read that my coach was talking to green bay but i can only do what i can do thats all i try to worry about
2191191 he doesnt have any allusions about being the key to the vikings success this season
2191192 its all anybody talks about hes the weak link stuff like that you know that old dan reeves line never let em see you sweat thats what he does a great job of
2191193 it kind of gave me some perspective on tarvaris donovan was still a work in progress at that point as far as the throws he was making and wasnt making
2191194 playing quarterback is just an evolution name me somebody who was great right out of the gate dan marino went to the big game right away but peyton manning threw 28 interceptions his first year who was great in their second year not many
2191195 hes not a roller coaster rider he locked his jaw at the end of the season and said this is what i need to get better at and he set out to do that youre talking about a kid who was here in the beginning of march when he didnt have to be he came in on saturdays in the offseason to work with his position coach thats unheard of so he wants to be good thats half the battle
2191196 im able to go through my reads faster im able to recognize coverages faster and different matchups i just feel a lot better than i did last year
2191197 im still a young guy and im still going to make some young guy mistakes but i feel a lot more comfortable out there than i did a year ago last year i was just trying not to make mistakes this year im still trying to avoid mistakes but im also trying to make plays and be aggressive
2191198 weve got to be able to beat one on one coverage on the outside bernard berrian who was acquired in the offseason will help us with that sidney rice an 07 second rounder who caught 31 passes as a rookie will help us with that now that hes a year two guy i like what ive seen in camp from tight end visanthe shiancoe an 07 free agent signing last year he was somewhat lost system wise but i dont see the wheels grinding anymore so all of those things should help
2191199 the biggest difference i see in him is his confidence
2191200 hes much more comfortable at the position i saw it in the otas it just seemed like he knew where to go with the ball in the presnap as opposed to dropping back and kind of figuring it out then
2191201 smoggy as hell giving way to just plain smoggy and with luck there could be a shower heavy enough to scrub a few thousand tons of carbon based particulates from the air
2191202 i prayed to god to send his angels to protect us
2191203 he gave me the verse in nahum 1 7 the lord is good a refuge in times of trouble for those who trust in him i believe the angels stretched their big wings to keep the big church from falling in the direction of our house
2191204 this is a wakeup call to all christians especially to the karen tribe who is the biggest christian tribe in myanmar and the first recipients of the gospel
2191205 we went to this village with 500 families all buddhists
2191206 my dad had the privilege to preach about the living god and that he is sovereign it was the first time that a christian preached in their village they begin to see a different light and they see that christians are a loving people and care for their well being
2191207 i really want to play on the team but thinking about it would get in my way it almost would make me try too hard so i think if i just focus on what gets me to play well that will help me and if i do get on the team it will help me play well in the ryder cup
2191208 theres a lot of golf ahead of me im just excited to be playing well
2191209 ive been very inconsistent this year and i just decided to make a change
2191210 i got a little different information and i kind of worked on it and it just clicked
2191211 today i felt like i didnt hit the ball very good but i was able to get it around the golf course if that happened maybe a month ago i probably would have shot a few over par so im happy where my game is i think its only going to get better too
2191212 i think the tough thing is to basically know youre not able to play and youre watching guys youre competing with play every week and youre kind of throbbing at the mouth a little bit
2191213 i find it pretty easy to let this course intimidate you its one of those old school challenges that just kind of never lets up but its still golf if you hit it in the right spots you should be fine
2191214 weve never had a year like this its the worst
2191215 the tomato plants sat there for a month in cold wet soil they didnt die they just didnt advance
2191216 they go into defense mode and slow down when temperatures go above 90 degrees
2191217 you can also have lighter and darker spots on the same fruit theyre fine thats just a heat response
2191218 tomatoes were in demand people were asking for them and they just werent available
2191219 we had a whole week of rain heavy rain and a very cold wind
2191220 come to think of it i guess were lucky we had tomatoes at all
2191221 when frost comes thats it no matter when we started picking we dont get a break
2191222 we have a lot of green ones but we do have some red ones
2191223 we had one tiny tomato and he picked it when it was almost completely green
2191224 hes endured and hes still throwing the same stuff it shows that pitching isnt about throwing hard its about being smart
2191225 as far as i know im going to play in 2009
2191226 theres a lot of baseball left to be played this year and thats what i need to remain focused on i have to get through this year healthy but if i do that i have all intentions of playing next year
2191227 its usually one of the first things that goes through my mind
2191228 youre taking him away from the people who could help him thats not something were comfortable with right now
2191229 the team is doing great things i just want to stay out of the way believe it or not i can stay out of the way
2191230 i hope this is the last change well make for a long time
2191231 it wasnt that weird because id never done it before
2191232 hes like the pudgy guy who shows up at the company picnic everybody is laughing and then he walks away with all the trophies
2191233 its just real old and they havent kept it up ive heard stories about former mets manager art howe coming off a road trip and finding a rat a live rodent on his desk i remember us trying to catch a rat running around in the bullpen
2191234 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that
2191235 gerard neesham obviously had some other talented players that he was keen on
2191236 he didnt know much about me and obviously didnt like the way i looked
2191237 im very proud of that to follow in gavins footsteps its very humbling to be alongside someone like gav who ive admired and grew up loving
2191238 hes one of the greatest he will go down not only with the crows but in the history of the game as an all time great
2191239 he is just an unbelievable player an absolute champion hes just does his thing out on the field and doesnt say anything
2191240 i roomed with him in ireland when we played the international rules series and got to know him pretty well hes very humble very quiet and a person that i really respect
2191241 ive seen him do some extraordinary things on the footy field his skill his pace his awareness to get in and out of packs is the best ive ever seen
2191242 i played on him a couple of times and ive seen him first hand destroy a couple of players he kicked seven goals against us western bulldogs in a preliminary final a few years back and blew us out of the water
2191243 que a algunos padres les encanta que sus hijos lo hagan
2191244 pero yo como soy megachupi guay les dejo vomitar todo lo que quieran en los jardines de m ndez n ez

2191252 it is particularly important that residents remain vigilant in their efforts to reduce their risk of west nile virus particularly now during peak mosquito season
2191253 it is also important that residents do their part to reduce potential mosquito breeding sites around their homes
2191254 mosquitoes capable of carrying west nile virus lay their eggs in stagnant water the eggs can develop in any pool or puddle of untreated water that stands undisturbed for more than four days

2191362 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2191363 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2191379 sometimes when i am quiet and open she returns with the house and the trees and we sit together in the warm glow just as we did so many years ago
2191380 long delays on m3 flashed up on the information boards on the crowded motorway which looked like a scene from bullitt
2191381 what if you slept and what if in your sleep you dreamed and what if in your dream you went to heaven and there plucked a strange and beautiful flower and what if when you awoke you had the flower in your hand ah what then

2191439 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2191440 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2191441 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2191469 this will be one of the greatest scientific experiments as well as the most expensive ever conducted on earth which fingers crossed will reveal truths about existence guessed at but never demonstrated
2191470 with the static timeline theory we must either presume that time travel is utterly impossible and always will be which might be the case but does not make good fiction or that providence is so deeply involved in controlling events that our entire science and perception of the universe is illusory
2191471 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
2191472 people always say that as if its a good thing

2191482 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2191483 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2191488 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2191489 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2191490 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2191491 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2191492 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
2191493 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
2191494 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more
2191495 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
2191496 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed

2191502 these characters are modern mythological characters that represent human emotion in a grand and somewhat operatic way

2191528 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2191529 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2191530 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself

2191536 ninety percent of disasters are already weather related and more intense and frequent hurricanes and floods are predicted by the intergovernmental panel on climate change says salvano brice o director of the international strategy for disaster reduction
2191537 we cannot wait we already have the tools to reduce the impact of climate related hazards and we need to use them now
2191538 we have seen events like the 2004 tsunami and recently cyclone nargis in myanmar and a typhoon in the philippines
2191539 there is no cookie cutter solution to climate change impacts its important that you are able to anticipate the likely impacts on your city and make the decision to deal with that

2191547 the old adage you cant please all the people all the time is true but if you can spend your research and insight budget in a way that will identify the clusters that make sense for your brand product then making your consumers 78 happy will more than deliver on your brand promise it will open new markets

2191770 this conference speaks to women with any number of needs from not feeling worthy to not having an understanding spouse women often have difficulty articulating how they feel because most of the time theyre not being responded to
2191771 my hope is that women would see themselves as god sees them

2191775 bissen sich die bullen schon zwei mal die z hne aus
2191776 es gab zwar immer wieder kleinere r ckschl ge der kursanstieg vollzog sich aber relativ stetig
2191777 gemessen an der volatilit t war die ge aktie im jahr 2000 also ein sicheres investment
2191778 auf diesem niveau war die ge aktie sehr billig die gewinnsituation hatte sich ja kaum verschlechtert doch pl tzlich galten die titel als hochvolatil also als riskant
2191779 but in terms of me and how ive been playing i have been getting hundreds and scoring runs
2191780 there was a lot of scrutiny that went with this match but i was so happy when i flipped the coin yesterday
2191781 i just went out and expressed myself today knowing i needed to score some runs and we needed to get a lead
2191782 i didnt think the captaincy affected me because before the game i still did the right things and the right amount of work i normally do
2191783 i dont like to make mountains out of molehills i just like to be as simple as i can
2191784 i built an innings played straight played in my areas played a few shots which were funky i suppose but just got on with it
2191785 in terms of my relationship with the players i have to keep growing that
2191786 that has come on leaps and bounds in the four days i have been in charge
2191787 i am getting to learn a lot more about how the guys operate and you have a really different perspective
2191788 you really want them to do well for them for you the team its really a holistic thing
2191789 it can only get worse if you look at it that way
2191790 but ive had more good days than bad days so far in my career
2191791 i just have to keep enjoying myself and trying to improve it is no surprise that i keep improving because i wake up every single morning trying to get better
2191792 besides the bounce and pace at this ground in particular the outfield is much drier than the others and you feel much more momentum in getting to the wicket
2191793 if the youngsters cant do it then myself and jakes have to stand up and show that we are still available for south africa for a long time
2191794 hanke tim and mike each made enormous contributions to the success of the chicago tribune during their exemplary careers
2191795 during this difficult time they have performed with grace and consummate professionalism for which i am deeply grateful we wish them the very best in the future
2191796 we also will be saying goodbye today to other colleagues
2191797 they too are among those who expressed a desire to go we offer our sincere thanks and appreciation for their contributions over the years unfortunately we still must make some additional involuntary reductions we now are in the process of evaluating the scope of these reductions nothing about this is easy but it is necessary

2191809 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
2191810 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
2191811 never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world
2191812 who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies
2191813 a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
2191814 what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like
2191815 everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content
2191816 i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love

2191835 do you see a big difference in terms of power between the ps3 and 360
2191836 both platforms are equally powerful and you wont see any difference in our games the 360 makes it easy for us to utilize all of its power the ps3 takes a bit longer because of the architecture but in the end we can get the same results on both platforms
2191837 both systems are very powerful with the 360 you dont have to work to utilize all of its power its just given to you with the ps3 you have to work a lot harder to get access to its power
2191838 failure to have an established process by which the fair market value of alternative investments can be determined

2191840 ali this is the hardest part of your life and its supposed to be hard
2191841 what percentage of my income is god calling me to give
2191842 which of the following mobile web metrics are important to you
2191843 but you must order the ticket now before any announcement is made if you wait until a fare rise is notified you will have to pay for most of the ticket at the new higher rate
2191844 it just seems absolutely mad to have a perfect well situated railway line which isnt being used
2191845 the fares are too high and for the new owners to increase them guaranteeing that theyll actually lose more customers it is the strangest business model i have ever seen
2191846 the real shame of this is that its actually an excellent service its fast its efficient the trains are clean theyre on time if the fares were reasonable if it wasnt cheaper to use a taxi im sure more people would use the service
2191847 clearly for any transport forms to be effective they have to be affordable and that is a long way from the case here
2191848 the failures that have existed in the past have got to be confronted by those who created them we would love to see much greater levels of affordable and accessible public transport in the city we need that particularly in a climate change constrained world
2191849 i am incredibly disappointed that the airport link company has ignored the communitys views
2191850 we have been running a campaign to reduce fares and the fare increase is a slap in the face the community has been left at the whim of a private company that can just arbitrarily increase fares the higher fares will put increased stress on buses and on roads in heffron they have ignored the petition and are further ignoring the community
2191851 it is just another example of monopolies treating consumers as milch cows
2191852 commuters feel like theyre being ripped off there are just too many hands in the travelling publics pocket the department of fair trading should take a full look at what is becoming institutionalised poor behaviour there needs to be a full review of how services are provided fairly it is just a free for all and the government simply must act
2191853 we have to continually review revenue and costs we are competitive compared to other services we didnt move concession fares for green square and mascot station users i think the increases are fair
2191854 for employees wishing to travel to and from work on trains sacl will purchase periodical tickets of three six or 12 month duration and employees will be able to repay the cost to sacl through payroll deduction over the term of the ticket
2191855 if you take up the offer then the major advantage will be the significant savings which can be realised for purchasing these tickets over the daily or weekly rates without having to have the money up front for the purchase
2191856 to reduce the cost burden on the use of train travel sacl will engage with the airport link company to discuss flexible ticketing arrangements for employees including a flexible weekly ticket for casual staff and reduced pricing for regular users
2191857 sacl is to liaise with the ministry of transport cityrail state transit bus service operators and the airport rail link company to review station access charges and to develop a flexible fares model to attract staff and passenger users
2191858 he gave no commitment to lowering the fares and shed absolutely no light on his reasons for increasing them
2191859 i told him he had to step up his game in communicating to the community regarding the rail line
2191860 i pointed out to him that you only get this level of community outrage when you ignore the community

2191868 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2191869 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2191870 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2191871 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2191872 learning a new language is one of the most important challenges newcomers face when they arrive in canada

2191876 this iraqi forces surge explains how we can continue to see very low levels of violence even though coalition forces have taken away a lot of combat power based
2191877 the operations in basra really instituted the rule of law there
2191878 the people there are able to live freely again without intimidation and extortion by militias
2191879 what you saw and what youre seeing now in mosul and diyala is a more determined enemy in terms of holding ground
2191880 the iraqis are really developing and have come a long way
2191881 it takes a while to develop the kind of leadership theyve shown were focusing on that key leadership and bolstering them so we have a vibrant and successful counterinsurgency force

2191886 kannuu has award winning innovative lookup solutions we are excited that they are opening up their knowledge and encouraging the development community to innovate and build upon their knowledge
2191887 we look forward to seeing what independent developers will design for the next generation of consumer applications
2191888 i am delighted sanjay will be joining motorola as co ceo and as ceo of mobile devices and i look forward to partnering with him
2191889 and one last question thats been getting asked a lot
2191890 last week president bush said in a television interview that in addition to attending tonights opening ceremony he might attend sundays basketball opener between the united states and china
2191891 the risk could be shared with the nsw government the government could compensate the company for any loss of revenue in the first three years
2191892 had a meeting with the airport rail link company on friday 8 june as an introduction to the new owners and the managing director
2191893 the issue of station access fees was raised at the meeting and the matter is the subject of ongoing discussions between railcorp and the arlc any decision to change station access fees rests with the arlc
2191894 the airport link company needs to integrate mascot station and the airport rail link into the whole public transport system
2191895 there is no point creating a new precinct which will be served by mascot station if it is not fully integrated
2191896 more people will be using the line and the plan is aimed at increasing the attractiveness of the area so you need to bring the people to mascot and the best way of doing this is to have a fully integrated public transport system
2191897 if you dont have good transport you dont have good communities
2191898 any decision we make would flow through to the four airport rail link stations
2191899 the cityrail portion of an airport rail link ticket that is the part of the fare subject to the ipart process makes up only a small proportion of the ticket price
2191900 the other portion of the ticket is not subject to ipart because of the botched deal struck by the liberal transport minister bruce baird with barry ofarrell as his chief of staff which leaves the station access fee entirely to the operator to decide
2191901 this is what puts commuters at risk the owners of the airport rail link can set the prices as high as they like with no transparent process in place to ensure commuters get a fair deal
2191902 the government itself should pay the access fee to the station owners the government has done something similar to harmonise bus fares between privately owned and government owned buses
2191903 an enchanting story of faith and family that is as enlightening as it is encouraging

2191906 russia is authoritarian let it remain so and let us no longer try to change that
2191907 the weakening of human beings in the west while in the east they are becoming stronger and stronger
2191908 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2191909 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2191910 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2191911 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa

2191915 i read the dictionary the other day turns out the
2191916 making sense of history and drawing warmth out of the cold
2191917 i dont where this all came from its hilarious its like somebody says something and they run like wildfire with this stuff youre always guilty until proven innocent
2191918 i wish it were true i got a lot of satisfaction working at symantec but it was a big pay cut from being a poker player i had children and it seemed like a better lifestyle for my family
2191919 i played poker for my whole life from the age of 12 even while i was at symantec but because i worked so hard at symantec i didnt get to play very often when i got breaks between projects i would play poker i actually had to play poker between projects to supplement my income
2191920 then hold em became legal in california and no limit hold em was my strongest game once that became legal i was leaving too much money on the table not playing poker so i finished my last project and went back to playing full time
2191921 ive spent almost a million dollars each of these past two years on expenses and tournament entries and when ive won ive given my money away
2191922 i always give half my tournament money to children incorporated usually the other money goes to other organizations that help children because i like helping children the most
2191923 um i had a good run from about 1997 to 2004 where i think that was true but when people ask me who the most successful cash game players of all time were i always say doyle brunson and chip reese they are the ones who have played in the biggest games since the 70s theyve taken on all comers and theyve obviously done well because theyve never had to go down to a lower limit ive done well enough to where ive been able to give away lots of money to charity and take care of my family
2191924 im certainly not a pleasure player i dont play poker for the enjoyment i do play for the money basically if i didnt need the money i would stop working and for me the working is the side games
2191925 even if i was financially independent i would still play some tournaments particularly the wsop and the wpt because its a lot of fun i enjoy playing in those and theres a lot of emotional energy a lot of highs and lows
2191926 well i didnt know i was appearing on a reality tv show they tricked me and told me they were doing a documentary about me
2191927 at least once a month i get asked to go on a tv show or to do some tv interview and ive been on some poker shows like many poker players ive even appeared in a couple movies lucky you and no limit both coming out in 2006
2191928 the producer of daisy does america said we want to show people what a day in the life of a professional poker player is like so i said okay i can take a couple hours and talk to you guys
2191929 i didnt know what was going on except the person who was interviewing me was hitting on me a lot
2191930 before the show aired my son told me its like an ali g thing where they try to embarrass the people they interview
2191931 but the truth is they were pretty fair with me they fooled me but they didnt embarrass me
2191932 when i was younger i played a lot of heads up poker
2191933 i see that in phil ivey now i see a lot of how i was when i was younger in phil ivey and thats probably one of the reasons were friends
2191934 now i dont have the stamina i had when i was younger our big games are more scheduled we have families and other commitments and typically we do quit at 2 or 3 in the morning
2191935 i think non players have enjoyed my book more than poker players because its very readable and it lets them into a world that they were unaware existed its about how to enjoy life as a poker player
2191936 but the advanced players are the ones who read it and say this is my life its relevant to them from a first hand basis whereas for non players its more from a third person perspective
2191937 most poker books have the basics defining the game defining terms starting from the assumption that some people reading dont know how to play poker
2191938 my book is advanced from a psychological perspective of poker not necessarily mathematically advanced as some people assume its necessary psychology and philosophy for anyone whos going to be a professional poker player

2191943 the idea of vacationing is to spend time with your family rather than worrying about how much youve spent

2191976 actuellement toute aide am ricaine non humanitaire est suspendue et en cours dexamen
2191977 there needs to be an investigation into how this has gone wrong
2191978 quite clearly the conservative administration has been shocked and worried by this and it doesnt know where it is going to find the money from it is clearly embarrassed by this
2191979 cabinet members have been told there are many reasons why costs have risen including unforeseen events and alterations and changes to the scheme demanded by
2191980 the size of the overrun is not yet finalised and costs may have to be met by a contingency in the council reserves
2191981 they say it might come from balances and if the final figure is in the millions it could mean the people who are going to lose out are taxpayers and service users
2191982 hemos recibido aproximadamente 160 denuncias en todo el pa s y estamos integrando los expedientes estamos haciendo las investigaciones y esperamos que antes de que empiece el procero electoral federal nosotros ife ya tendremos posibilidades de llegar a conclusiones en t rminos de si realmente se viol la norma constitucional o no
2191983 las sanciones que son aplicables son diversas desde amonestaci n p blica que digamos es la m s leve hay sanciones pecuniarias es decir multas y hay una sanci n que est incluida en el c digo federal electoral que es la que sanciona los actos anticipados de campa a negando el registro como candidato
2191984 tenemos que implantar una infraestructura a todo lo largo y ancho del pa s para que todas las estaciones de radio y todos los canales de televisi n sean monitoreados y se tenga la certeza de que el contenido de la nueva ley electoral se est aplicando correctamente
2191985 your mind just races with all we could do and it is just so exciting for us
2191986 will we have a show like that no will we have a show thats wholly canadian of course it will and it will inspire the world
2191987 but also if they can do that then i can do something as creative
2191988 the things were planning to do are on track and judging from what ive heard about the timing for beijing and where they were at certain times were in good shape
2191989 its not going to be a mad rush at the end
2191990 it reminds us that the next time our olympic athletes take part in the opening ceremony and the next time the drama of the olympic cauldron lighting stirs everyones hearts as it did tonight it will be at home in 2010
2191991 what a proud night for china and for all canadians as we get ready to be the next host and share that same stage of honour
2191992 damages along with amcs mad men became the first basic cable drama series ever nominated in the golden globes outstanding series category
2191993 i could go through every adjective i know amazing incredible exciting awesome it still doesnt do it justice
2191994 the best part about it was walking along and looking up in the stands and seeing canadian flags canadians in red standing up and then chinese in red standing up and waving canadian flags so many maple leafs i felt like i was walking into the stadium in toronto
2191995 the opening ceremonies were incredible all the show was amazing i didnt expect this at all
2191996 ive never seen a stadium that big it was just crazy waving at everybody ill do it again if its possible
2191997 the coolest part was hearing everyone in the tunnel singing o canada
2191998 the energy was extraordinary as we walked into the stadium
2191999 the dancing the music and all the canadian flags gave me goose bumps i was not expecting something like this
2192000 they have really done something well never see again a big elaborate coming out party for china
2192001 the performance is the perfect coming out party an amazing performance and something chinese people will be so proud of
2192002 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is

2192008 we are disappointed that the rmt have voted in favour of strike action as it serves no purpose whatsoever
2192009 if i have a chance to speak id be honored i want to do whatever it takes to get him over the goal line
2192010 i dont necessarily think there has to be a catholic strategy because im not sure the catholic vote is any more monolithic or predictable than any other vote
2192011 the most committed pro life voter and the most committed pro choice voter can come together over the issue of how do we help pregnant women
2192012 when a pro life voter considers that question which has a moral gravity to it which we dont talk about enough on balance barack has a better record
2192013 i can tell you that sen obama is grateful for the friendship and support he has received from sen casey in this campaign
2192014 i think were making progress but its not going to be easy
2192015 a microbiological sterilizing cure in large numbers of people at this point in time is not likely
2192016 he tries to let us not forget that even if its not in the foreseeable future a cure is still to be thought about
2192017 will it happen i dont know should we aim for it certainly yes
2192018 treatment is not enough to solve this problem and no one here is saying we can treat our way out of this epidemic
2192019 tremendously real and psychological boost it would give to the roll out of treatment everywhere
2192020 desperate race against time in the search for prevention that works
2192021 it would have been a huge inducement to roll out treatment more quickly
2192022 we should still treat people because they need to be treated
2192023 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2192024 should this happen dhl will cede significant elements of cost and quality to one of its chief competitors consumers all over america would suffer
2192025 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2192026 theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
2192027 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2192028 my colleagues in the government dont trust me because ive been with the press and the people in the press dont trust me because im with the government
2192029 what she does with that law over the next six months will determine how it is respected and interpreted by public officials from the capitol to township supervisors
2192030 its that old saying you dont get a second chance at a first impression
2192031 if i make a mistake its going to be on the side of openness
2192032 we wanted to end that situation as soon as possible
2192033 there was a need for terry and her staff to say no were not going away
2192034 i want the best pool to do this because i think were going to be a very unpopular group
2192035 this adverse event appears to be clinically relevant to consider only in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk

2192037 use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and risk of myocardial infarction in hiv infected patients enrolled in the smart study
2192038 there are anecdotal suggestions that at surbiton station car park there are cars that park there all day five days a week and there are questions over how disabled they may be
2192039 if theres evidence that theres a substantial revenue loss in car parks that may persuade the executive that it is worth saving that loss
2192040 black cabs are an invaluable part of londons transport network and over 250 000 people use them every day
2192041 we recognise the burden that fuel price increases have had on taxi drivers this year
2192042 fuel makes up about 10 per cent of the costs of running a taxi and unlike many other trades taxi drivers cannot put prices up to reflect increased costs
2192043 the credit crunch is hitting everyone hard and the council has noticed a dramatic increase in its fuel expenditure
2192044 im really pleased for all the people whove got their money back and were delighted to have been integral to that
2192045 we will now press on with trying to recover money for the people who fell foul of the confusingly signed market place loading bays
2192046 the story there is different but the effects are just as unjust as in the hill rise case
2192047 a review of hill rise established that the location is not part of the
2192048 as a result tfl has refunded all penalty charge notices that have been issued by us at this location as this loading bay falls under the jurisdiction of london borough of barnet
2192049 we have contacted all those who have been given a penalty charge notice in error and refunded their money

2192054 it will transform this area in terms of travel times for people going to their jobs and will bring jobs here as well
2192055 its going to be wonderful having lived here for quite a few years weve seen a decline in the area crossrail will lift it back up this is what everybody is waiting for
2192056 we have tried to absorb the rising cost of fuel but it has now reached a point where we must pass on an increase to our customers in the high wycombe area but we have tried to limit this
2192057 my staff and i spend much time going outside warning drivers who have pulled up in that spot
2192058 it came to our attention recently that the traffic wardens were in fact coming out with the towing truck and not on their own
2192059 they knew that they would always find a car parked there i think they were waiting for their victim which is quite disgraceful
2192060 it is extremely important to ensure dropped kerbs which are used for the convenience of disabled people and mothers with prams are kept clear at all times
2192061 however enfield council strives to be reasonable in its parking enforcement and as such we are currently investigating this case
2192062 i feel that i have been robbed by my own borough and i feel a great sense of injustice
2192063 we get our address details from dvla and they only hold the uk database for vehicles
2192064 very few overseas vehicles ever pay parking tickets the final recourse for us is to send a bailiff and it has always been deemed that to send them abroad to pick up a parking fine at a cost of around 90 is not worthwhile
2192065 there is a lobbying group called sparks which is looking to enable local authorities in the uk and eu member states to collaborate in resolving the issue of cross border enforcement of civil traffic contraventions

2192094 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
2192095 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
2192096 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
2192097 the fact that so many are here in the top ten does suggest there could be a link between the number of speed cameras in an area and the number of drivers with speed convictions
2192098 the thames valley area has the second highest number of cameras in the uk
2192099 the statistics for the thames valley police area and south bucks specifically really stand out
2192100 if you were getting accidents of the same quantity you would have to look at the road layout when so many people are falling into the same trap they are not all doing it deliberately
2192101 we certainly have plenty of cameras around i know hazlemere has a notorious one and so has chalfont st giles
2192102 the areas are reasonably affluent which might be businesspeople who are high mileage drivers so there might be that association to do with their lifestyle then it would be less surprising to find they had quite a high instance of speeding convictions
2192103 there are so many reasons to dust off your bike this summer its a great way to get fit it saves you money and its good for the environment
2192104 lines are already long at peak times at many train stations across the constituency so to reduce ticket office opening times and staffing is madness
2192105 i have already had an exchange of correspondence with stewart palmer the managing director of swt if he thinks that automated vending is working well he should spend more time at our stations when there are often long queues and broken machines
2192106 swt are also being short sighted to ignore the tangible benefits of properly manned stations including reduction in vandalism and graffiti and reassurance for passengers travelling alone especially when stations are dark in winter
2192107 the airlines and airport operators have long been powerful advocates for their industry
2192108 yet the need for equally influential rail champions has never been greater
2192109 el problema no es la falta de dinero en canarias si no el tener prioridades equivocadas
2192110 lo peor que hay es hablar cuando no se han estudiado los temas
2192111 en que consiste la devoluci n que canarias reclama al estado cada a o
2192112 hacerle caso a saavedra y que elija entre irse a bruselas y quedarse en canarias

2192117 we saw a lot of these teams here at ncaas last year so we know what we are up against we have three super six teams coming here so its going to be a good challenge for us
2192118 we become addicted to a substance or activity for the same reason that we initially try it because we like the way it makes us feel
2192119 and although some people may try a drug take a drink or eat a doughnut and never become hooked almost all of us have the capability to become addicted users cross a threshold and undergo a transition to addiction
2192120 these are two institutions i dont think would have crossed paths
2192121 this involves teamwork and bonding as a class while giving back to the community
2192122 were sending them that message early on so our graduates will leave with that embedded in them
2192123 they dont have the facilities to keep youngsters healthy and active
2192124 this is a way to help people in the community to have a more even hopeful life
2192125 in a city that has a lot of poor people this community had even more
2192126 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2192127 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2192128 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2192129 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2192130 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2192131 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2192132 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2192133 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2192134 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2192135 taxpayers should not continue to support city employees who have been accused of serious criminal wrongdoing related to their official duties
2192136 i would encourage everyone to keep an open mind until the proceedings have concluded
2192137 we do not pay for criminal defense of indicted employees
2192138 mr wright has been indicted for using his council staff position and influence to secure favorable treatment from city officials for development projects if we are to maintain confidence in city government our leadership must hold their subordinates accountable
2192139 will make a decision regarding chris wrights employment at the appropriate time not on someone elses schedule
2192140 i think its interesting to note that the committee of seventy has appointed itself judge jury and executioner
2192141 i suppose the notion of innocence before guilt does not apply in their world
2192142 exactly how close can someone who wants favors from city government be to a campaign
2192143 its an important enough issue to merit review on its own
2192144 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2192145 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2192149 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2192150 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2192151 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2192152 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2192153 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2192154 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2192155 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2192156 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2192157 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2192158 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
2192159 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2192160 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2192161 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2192162 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2192163 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2192164 people still werent getting more money in their pockets at the same time costs were going up
2192165 so it was harder to save harder to retire which meant people were maxing out on their credit cards they were taking out home equity loans to pay off bills
2192166 we need to crack down on those who have abused our credit market and caused this housing decline
2192167 and we need to take action to support american businesses so that we stop jobs from going overseas and create more jobs here at home
2192168 we need help getting the housing market back on its feet
2192169 contracted partly because the federal government did not oversee the lending process as effectively as it should have
2192170 they think that theyre better off today than they were four or eight years ago do they think that the economy is working right now
2192171 if they do then they should work their heart out for john mccain because his policies are not different from what george bush has been offering
2192172 it will be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
2192173 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs
2192174 they absolutely recognize housing is a major issue for this country
2192175 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2192176 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2192177 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2192178 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2192179 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2192180 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2192181 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2192182 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2192183 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2192184 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2192185 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2192186 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2192187 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2192188 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2192189 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2192190 i guess the state of new jersey still hasnt caught on that we dont use their services
2192191 those residents pay their income tax pay the sales tax and on balance do not get the benefits of the state programs other more heavily populated areas get
2192192 we feel that in lowering the bill and putting that cap on it we certainly heard the concerns of the towns
2192193 it would allow us to spread our manpower into smaller municipalities who cant afford to have their own police force and better cover highways
2192194 youre looking at 1 200 per response which is ludicrous
2192195 the attorney general determined that those towns while they had police forces due to high violent crime rates and other public safety concerns they needed some help from the state police
2192196 theyre really trying unfortunately to balance the states budget on the backs of the rural municipalities
2192197 its something that is mandated and we dont have the money budgeted for it
2192198 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2192199 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2192200 i understand that iraq and afghanistan are extremely important we all understand that
2192201 but there are other things that are important the terrorists that are on our streets that are killing our children thats very important too
2192202 were sick and tired of it these issues must be addressed and were going to continue to press them
2192203 i think if the candidates are asked they will then be forced to respond to these kinds of issues
2192204 the searches in europe are going on as i speak
2192205 they have already seized half a billion euro dollars as well as a large cache of firearms
2192206 all the intelligence we have gathered here in australia all the intelligence about the methodology will be shared with our european partners so we can shut this syndicate down
2192207 it was great standing up there in front of everyone and im sure it is something ill never forget
2192208 journalism is such an exciting field and the program is unbelievable at missouri
2192209 i only looked at strong journalism schools coming out of high school when i met with the professors and learned about the approach they take the technologies id be learning and depth of the program i knew missouri would help get me where i wanted to be professionally the campus is beautiful and i just loved the girls on the team they were a riot and we had so much in common it all just came together and im excited
2192210 then he just grew up and decided i can do this
2192211 his father rick charlson said friday his voice swelled by pride and heartbreak
2192212 so he stuck it out i think now towards the end its just what you do he was very responsible
2192213 the morning he left he called at 7 05 or so in the morning he said what was going to happen he was excited hed never been in a helicopter before so he was really looking forward too that
2192214 we said all our i love yous that was the end of every conversation
2192215 he enjoyed being in the woods looking at stuff that was growing wildlife panoramas
2192216 he didnt talk very much about things like that he was really very private
2192217 he was always the kind of guy who could make you laugh even if something real serious was happening
2192218 he had had a knowledge for sports he really could have done something with it he would predict that somebody would get traded or this was going to happen who was going to be drafted first he would always know
2192219 i never knew him to read a book in the 25 years ive known him and here he is a journalism major he loved sports so much he knew who was on every team what trades were going i think he would have made a great sports analyst his goal was to write for espn or sports illustrated or something like that
2192220 so he worked in forestry because he could earn the most amount of money in one summer to pay for that
2192221 he had to borrow all the money for his own schooling we couldnt help him with anything
2192222 love will die if held too tightly time 2 let go
2192223 love can be bad it can treat you like dirt i wont be proud of that so im bowing out so you can stay clean
2192224 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2192225 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2192226 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2192227 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2192228 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2192229 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2192230 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2192231 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2192232 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2192233 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2192234 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2192235 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
2192236 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
2192237 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2192238 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2192239 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2192240 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2192241 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2192242 id be the butter on a ben kuchera and christian nutt sandwich

2192248 you dont get it you added attributes to my character that i didnt just start over

2192262 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2192263 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2192264 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2192265 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2192266 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2192267 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2192268 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2192269 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2192270 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2192282 erst als der radiologe mich v llig verst rt beim verlassen der praxis abfing und in sein zimmer zur ck bat geriet ich in heftige panik weil ich dachte er h tte doch noch etwas schlimmes entdeckt

2192301 as que le he propuesto a l w al igual que a andreas k pke que no cuente conmigo para el equipo nacional
2192302 sabemos que tenemos que mejorar en nuestra atenci n defensiva porque algunos goles han sido en bal n parado pero estamos en el camino para corregir para que no vuelvan a suceder
2192303 hemos tenido lapsos muy buenos de posesi n de pelota de llegar a la porter a rival pero no nos hemos mantenido en el nivel los 90 minutos tal vez porque no entramos con la debida atenci n a la cancha o porque un gol en contra nos modifica todo pero es algo que platicamos en estos dos con la intenci n de solucionarlo hay que ser conscientes del trabajo defensivo del equipo desde el delantero hasta el portero podemos mejorar en muchas situaciones hay que buscar la manera de concretar en ello y de lograr la victoria en casa
2192304 me parece que es un equipo que se renov y que est concentrado en librar la situaci n del descenso y han tenido dos resultados que manejaron bien ante indios de ciudad ju rez y chivas y me parece que por ello el de ma ana ser un partido muy complicado
2192305 hay que ser anal ticos de las situaciones y me parece que tecos es un equipo que sabe manejar los tiempos sacar un resutlado con diez hombres menos halba de que son un equipo ordenado en eso ha ganado mucho tecos y prometen ser un buen rival en la competencia

2192327 clearly if a taser is used as an alternative to shooting someone dead then that is one thing

2192352 at the end of the day you will see somewhat of an increase in our fees but we really are such an important source of refinancing help for people who are stuck in these subprime mortgages right now but we want to make sure that if people want to stay in their home and if they can afford to stay in their home with the right mortgage
2192353 there is a group of loans that were getting from people whose down payment was financed by the seller those loans defaulted at a very high rate congress also banned that practice which improves the quality of our portfolio significantly
2192354 we already know there are borrowers we are working with that cannot avoid foreclosure even with this bill that has passed this bill is not as sweeping that it will take everyone out of foreclosure
2192355 some borrowers are just in personal situations that even the components of this bill will not assist them
2192356 what should have happened was corporate reorganization keep the companies going but not protect the management the shareholders not even protect the creditors the whole basis of a market economy is a system of accountability you make decisions you take risks you get the upside but you also take the downside
2192357 these guys that are supposed to be assessing and managing risks have repeatedly failed and i think thats what we really have to get our minds around the fact that we had such confidence in these gurus of the financial markets we turn to them about how to fix the system but these are the guys that broke the system
2192358 nextcare is thrilled to be able to combine the talents and compassion of the highly competent medical staff that has been serving the asheville community for many years with the innovative and technological approach that nextcare brings as a leader in the urgent care industry

2192361 ongoing relationship with a primary care doctor who coordinates care and follows them over time
2192362 the local critical mass group completed their may ride and pedaled over to a local bike friendly watering hole for post ride refreshments as we sat on the patio the discussion of music for the rides was brought up my background includes work with car stereo systems and i felt that a car stereo modified for use on a bicycle would offer superior performance to the small battery powered boom boxes we had previously used after some discussion about how to make it work i decided to give it a try
2192363 there are a few things to consider when building a car stereo without the car first car stereos are terribly inefficient when it comes to power consumption cars use alternators to provide a constant source of power using only a battery would require some self restraint with wattage and volume levels next is the batteries themselves car batteries are quite literally filled with lead and they weigh between 25 and 55lbs finally where to put all this stuff i decided a trailer would be the best solution because it would allow me to keep the weight low and provide space for all the components
2192364 first i had to design the stereo system i had an old 2 channel car audio amp laying around the garage i purchased some 6 5 speakers from wal mart they are not fancy but i they do the trick i also got some wires and a switch to use as an amp turn on a fellow critical mass rider contributed a car battery she also provided use of her ipod with the stereo designed it was time to start thinking about trailers
2192365 a local rider learned about the project through a bike forum and donated a commercial kiddie trailer arm for use
2192366 my total build cost was about 300 if someone wanted to replicate this trailer exactly the cost would likely be much higher because i did not factor in parts and supplies i already had at my home or the specialized skills such as welding and composites fabrication that i used this trailer as cool as it is was really a proof of concept for me and in the future i would like to build version 2 0 including a deep cycle battery for improved play times an integrated fm tuner so the ipod could control the stereo from a handlebar mount and id use a 3 or 4 channel amp and a subwoofer to improve bass response
2192367 the trailer was a huge success it was pulled at the june critical mass ride and met with a fantastic reception from participants and onlookers alike it was used again for a patriotic themed ride on july 4th where it again exceeded my wildest expectations
2192368 we have a lot of big plans for mass effect
2192369 having a ds version would be an awesome way to keep interest alive and keep it going in addition to the next one
2192370 some of that criticism is probably warranted we definitely recognize that a franchise that has been going as long as sonic you really have to put a huge amount of effort in to make sure that you maintain that quality and arguably a disproportionate amount of effort
2192371 however i would say we recognize it which is why youre seeing us this year taking the first steps in making sure the quality is right and were constantly looking at innovation
2192372 this time around with sonic unleashed we got a great new engine the hedgehog engine and that allows us to truly deliver the sonic experience as it arguably should have been on the next gen you know blending classic 2d gameplay with 3d beautiful landscapes rich environments
2192373 then with a nice innovative twist were taking sonic in a different direction slow him down and he transforms into a werehog and that changes the gameplay again for fans of sonic that have been looking for a next gen experience this is the game theyve been waiting for
2192374 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
2192375 unless there is a real partnership i e more money for us among game marketers and artists and labels wmg will be hesitant about going further to license its music for video games
2192376 with everything we build now we want to have this long term relationship with the customer and always have something for them to try so were definitely looking at that for mass effect
2192377 what is the biggest mistake made in the black panther party

2192390 i think we have designed a system that has addressed a major concern people had about the local driver
2192391 this is just another interim step toward the final goal
2192392 the pennsylvania turnpike commission has a 67 year history of over promising and under delivering
2192393 so i 80 motorists shouldnt get too excited about any plan that portends to offer driver discounts
2192394 we want to see whether the provisions of the agreement are serious we will be satisfied if the agreement contains the withdrawal of us forces
2192395 if so we will complete the reorganisation of the mahdi army which aims to transform it into a social organisation
2192396 we will be forced to await the decision of withdrawal of american forces

2192400 over the past 3 days senator obama has taken pandering to a new level offering what i consider to be a bribe by telling american families that his windfall profits tax would be used to provide a 1 000 per family rebate despite the historical failure of such policies somehow they continue to draw appeal from those who dont care about the cost of such programs
2192401 so how much would obamas 1 000 per family cost the oil companies
2192402 consider this according to the obama campaigns statistics regarding his proposed working family tax credit the credit would affect around 150 million us workers or about 80 million families as such you can assume that his 1 000 per family or 500 per individual energy rebate would also affect the same 150 million workers so now lets do the math
2192403 a 1 rebate would cost 150 million a 10 rebate would cost 1 5 billion a 100 rebate would cost 15 billion a 500 rebate would cost 75 billion
2192404 now according to obama this rebate would be provided through his pelosis and reids windfall profits tax sounds great right
2192405 hmm now you may have to get a calculator to figure the exact percentage but how exactly is obama going to pay for his 75 billion rebate
2192406 this is just the incentive oil companies need to do exploration to do research to help with our foreign oil dependency
2192407 en este torneo no hab a jugado pero lamentablemente para david oteo que se lastim y bueno la verdad estoy contento que me haya tocado a mi participar en este partido y veremos qu sucede m s adelante si me toca o no estar igual que siempre yo a seguir trabajando si no me toca igual apoyar a mis compa eros y si se me da tratar de aprovechar la oportunidad y mantenerme en el cuadro titular
2192408 l a verdad te digo no sab a bien cu nto tiempo iba a estar fuera david pero bueno lo importante es que se recupere l y te digo si me toca que bien tratar de dar mi m ximo esfuerzo y hacer bien las cosas el partido ante cruz azul
2192409 claro yo siempre trabajo para eso para estar entre los once titulares si me toca o no ya es decisi n del entrenador pero mientras trabaje tienes m s posibilidades de estar en el cuadro titular y repito si me toca otra vez bienvenido sea tratar de aportar lo que yo s y con muchas ganas e inteligencia
2192410 no no creo que nos afecte por ah igual y podemos hacer futbol entre nosotros no s si van a conseguir alg n partido si es importante seguir teniendo actividad pero no creo que influya mucho para el pr ximo partido vamos a tener otra semana m s para trabajar y para plantear bien el partido que sigue

2192412 estos partidos sirven para tratar de lograr una plantilla lo m s homog nea posible a estas alturas no buscamos resultados ni funcionamiento sino una preparaci n acorde a toda la plantilla y no a un equipo
2192413 se est trabajando de forma muy intensa y no se ha bajado la carga de intensidad en todos los amistosos que hemos disputado la pretemporada se est realizando en base a lo previsto y por suerte ha habido muy pocas lesiones
2192414 llorente ibagaza y edm lson son tres refuerzos importantes que seguramente van a cumplir un rol de apoyo y se han integrado r pidamente al funcionamiento del equipo
2192415 if i dont seem as depressed or morose as i should be sorry to disappoint you
2192416 im dying and im having fun and im going to keep having fun every day i have left because theres no other way to play it

2192418 under the ruse of giving an academic lecture i was trying to put myself in a bottle that would one day wash up on the beach for my children
2192419 id like to thank the millions of people who have offered their love prayers and support randy was so happy and proud that the lecture and book inspired parents to revisit their priorities particularly their relationships with their children
2192420 i have raised most of my financial support and i am in the process of having mission for unreached peoples mups to back me with insurance benefits and members of their team to come and check on me from time to time to make sure im alive and well
2192421 what i really need is a caregiver to go with me to help with my daily needs as well as writing long extensive e mails and typing reports
2192422 this woman needs to have a heart for the nations and for the disabled she would be commissoned by mups and receive a three part training just like myself
2192423 she will be the american counterpart for a team of indians who are providing care for me
2192424 this would allow each team member to have personal time and rest breaks
2192425 although i see myself in india long term i have committed initially for one to two years to work out the logistics of living overseas with a disability and would like for this woman to commit to that time as well

2192448 the victim had been on the lookout for any of the property popping up
2192449 it was a pretty bad break and it was very painful so while i healed i gave a lot of thought to whether i wanted to continue competing finally i decided it wasnt worth the risk of possibly getting hurt again and all that it entails when you have to take time off from work and from life
2192450 i got my degree as a physical therapist assistant and began working at buffalo spine and sports and while my career there was definitely fulfilling i really missed being involved in sports
2192451 i went on the internet and read about running techniques and ways to train then i started looking online for local races that seemed interesting
2192452 i decided that i wanted to challenge myself to improve
2192453 so i entered the buffalo half marathon which i ended up completing in just under two hours
2192454 there were a couple of points when i didnt know if i could keep going specifically miles 9 10 and 11 they had a lot of hills and were really tough but i was determined to push through and finish no way was i going to stop
2192455 im always looking for opportunities to better myself and running allows me to do that
2192456 i can strive to compete not only against better runners but to compete against my self my own times and work on improving my own personal best
2192457 i felt that since i did well in the half marathon i could do fairly well in the 10k
2192458 when i crossed the finish line i immediately walked off to cool down and get some water finally when i went over to the finish board i was very surprised and excited to see the results that i actually did achieve my goal of winning a medal
2192459 we will make decisions regarding that open position as we assess our options in collaboration with the other united ways which serve niagara county and the tonawandas

2192495 mr grear is exhibiting the same type of strange bizarre behavior that was evident is his ill fated run for sheriff a few years ago
2192496 mr grear should be calling out all of his democrat friends to do the right thing but that would take political courage to stand up for whats right
2192497 instead its clear hes trying to score some cheap political points
2192498 i know that inafune san and i are both huge proponents of the pc platform and capcom is an active participant in the

2192510 i dont like to go out and take a poll of people
2192511 i dont think i can make it to the election
2192512 i actually think im too tired to go on theyve exhausted me i mean its unbelievable i feel like this actual election started when i was 9 years old its got to just stop
2192513 i have two candidates one whos talking about yesterday the other whos talking about tomorrow
2192514 for the democratic party to try to appeal to me after what their congress did their congress did nothing for eight years and all of a sudden theyre supposed to take over the presidency what the republicans have done is disturbing beyond belief and they deserve it back i mean seriously
2192515 the good news is anybody can be president the bad news is anybody can be president it goes back to the old thing anybody who wants it probably isnt right for it

2192528 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2192529 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2192530 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2192531 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2192532 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia

2192549 its good to see a side go up with a real passing game it will certainly be a good game for the neutral as both sides will get the ball down and play
2192550 yeah we have had a bit of a chat luke said he tried to do me but i think he came off worse
2192551 seriously though he scored a couple against me last season and i saw then that he was such a big threat
2192552 this year we have got to use him as much as possible he scored eight or nine goals last year and he should get way more than that this time

2192559 im not sure that anybody can legitimately say that mccain is conservative
2192560 look i might get a news tip four months from when this article gets printed its not your timing and its not even mine theres a precise timing for every single facet of this news world and unfortunately you want it here and now and on your terms that wont fly
2192561 im not sure that anybody can legitimately say that mccain is conservative
2192562 a m e dele estava em p nico quando soube da transfer ncia mas ela j conversou com o diretor do complexo prisional que garantiu a seguran a do filho dela agora ela est bem mais calma
2192563 i really need this not for the money but like i need this i need to figure out like who i am please
2192564 how do you think the show will help you to figure out who you are
2192565 i mean i guess its pathetic to be my age and not know who you are but i dont know
2192566 clearly issues like gun and knife crime are a big issue for london and tower hamlets is no different the deaths of 21 youngsters this year because of knives cant be ignored
2192567 im at the enforcement end of this issue but weve all got to get more into diversion why is the climate such that kids feel they need to take knives out
2192568 weve got to get below the surface and engage with more youngsters and its all very well catching people but unless the courts support that work by providing an effective deterrent theres the potential for the whole effort to be undermined
2192569 terrorism is a feature of most days for me whether its community engagement or identifying youngsters at risk of radicalisation
2192570 we have iconic sites all over the borough from canary wharf to the tower of london and the royal london hospital
2192571 we have a team of community support officers who look after the tower of london and we work closely with canary wharf security to resassure and protect the public
2192572 im already looking at the number of officers ive got available to me and where theyre deployed there should always be an officer or community support officer in every ward
2192573 the police are not going to close at the moment we have a situation where victims and offenders are coming to the same building
2192574 we want areas where you can access services some more efficient custody spaces and an operating base from which officers are deployed
2192575 if you look at limehouse police station its a pretty unpleasant place to be and i dont want my officers working in an unpleasant environment
2192576 i just want to make sure my guests get their money back im getting married in a month and its cast a shadow over our day
2192577 we heard some rumours wrapit was about to go bust and they denied it when we asked them
2192578 its just an awful situation i really feel for those people who came back from their honeymoons to this
2192579 you feel angry for your guests because theyre the people that have spent the money but its difficult enough for young couples to make a new start in the current climate without something like this happening
2192580 were still using a lot of stuff from my student days well get by but it would be nice to have the gifts
2192581 we only found out about this problem through the media a lot of our guests are not happy they feel let down by the company
2192582 hsbcs view is that this should never have happened and had the directors acted sooner to address their financial difficulties and appointed administrators when hsbc recommended it may not have
2192583 the decline in industry volumes and the shift to more fuel efficient vehicles is creating a massive ripple effect in the supply chain
2192584 ford and gm are not going to file for bankruptcy
2192585 it would start a domino effect of bankruptcies throughout the supply base and it would tank consumer confidence in their brands even in markets like asia europe and south america where they are profitable and growing
2192586 their product lines will be more in line with consumer demands
2192587 i am very struck by the value placed on little models that are never actually confronted with data from the real world
2192588 there is a danger that the macroeconomic models now in use in central banks operate like a maginot line they have been constructed in the past as part of the war against inflation the central banks are prepared to fight the last war
2192589 agora nossas for as de paz travam uma violenta batalha com as for as do ex rcito georgiano na regi o sul de tskhinvali

2192610 let non knowledge be once again knowledge i will explore the night but no its the night that explores me

2192718 he senator gordon has a resolution then to reposition the armed troops there but this was not implemented because the tension was high and the people were emotional then they even refused to allow entry the jccch so the resolution was not implemented
2192719 i texted the president on the developments i told her madame president the peace efforts had paid off i just got one word from her congrats
2192720 help in seeing through our effort for peace on a sustainable basis through a final peace agreement with the milf
2192721 the repositioning of the concerned milf units particularly from the 105th base command of the milf is a positive development
2192722 as a manifestation that efforts for a peaceful solution to the conflict are working
2192723 this means they will be going back to their respective areas even as negotiations are being pursued for the complete pullout of milf forces our own troops have taken positions in neighboring barangays to provide security and assistance to displaced residents when they return to their homes and farmlands
2192724 there was subsequent fighting because those in the detachment were fired upon so they fired back there were at least 50 rebels involved in the harassment it was not apparently their intention to overrun the detachment the merely harassed the detachment

2192726 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way
2192727 people who farm now are not doing this for laughs despite the fact hollywood still thinks that theyre doing it to make a lot of money
2192728 theyre willing to kill anybody who gets in their way theyre taking money back to those who kill prosecutors judges and law enforcement
2192729 they come into our own national parks and risk the lives of sheriffs and others
2192730 theyre using family or very trusted family friends they dont just use anybody
2192731 youre recruited in for that purpose as long as youre trusted each person has his function
2192732 the people that are growing this are good at what they do
2192733 the goal is not just to eradicate the plants but to go after the organizations

2192735 were not just pulling the plants were targeting mid level and upper management of these trafficking organizations
2192736 often times we have people who will lead us to these gardens

2192740 investors are responding to the decline in commodity prices that weve seen recently
2192741 theyre rotating out of the fundamentally strongest groups and into sectors that may benefit going forward if oil prices continue to retreat

2192744 a pesar de nuestro llamamiento a la paz y del alto el fuego unilateral los separatistas continuaron bombardeando ciudades georgianas
2192745 los separatistas abrieron fuego en las localidades georgianas de prisi y tamaraheni y nosotros tuvimos que responder
2192746 como comandante supremo del pa s orden a las unidades de la polic a y al batall n de paz georgiano no responder al fuego que llevan a cabo en la zona del conflicto las formaciones armadas surosetas
2192747 tom esta decisi n a pesar de que tenemos varios muertos y numerosos heridos a causa de los incesantes ataques surosetas porque debemos poner fin a los enfrentamientos armados e iniciar negociaciones sin demora
2192748 hay carros de combate georgianos en tsjinvali hay combates encarnizados por toda la ciudad
2192749 70 por ciento de tsjinvali y las aldeas aleda as

2192751 lamentamos profundamente la p rdida de vidas y el sufrimiento de los civiles
2192752 si se confirma que tropas y armas rusas ingresaron a georgia significa que estamos en estado de guerra con rusia
2192753 ciento cincuenta tanques rusos transportes de personal blindados y otros veh culos han entrado en osetia del sur esta es una clara intrusi n en el territorio de otro pa s tenemos tanques rusos y aviones en nuestro territorio a plena luz del d a
2192754 las fuerzas georgianas han derribado dos aviones de combate rusos
2192755 nadie ha resultado herido pero algunos edificios han sido destruidos
2192756 a defender la vida y la dignidad de los ciudadanos rusos est n donde est n
2192757 hoy por la noche las tropas georgianas cometieron en osetia del sur un acto de agresi n contra las tropas rusas de paz y la poblaci n civil
2192758 las acciones de la parte georgiana han causado v ctimas entre ellos efectivos de las tropas de paz rusas
2192759 si no es una guerra estamos muy cerca de ello
2192760 saakashvili apoyado moralmente por sus patrocinadores occidentales decidi lanzar la agresi n
2192761 la sangre derramada en osetia del sur ser responsabilidad de esta gente y de sus aliados
2192762 no permitiremos que nuestras fuerzas de paz y los ciudadanos de la federaci n rusa resulten da ados
2192763 las tropas georgianas abrieron fuego directo contra las bases de emplazamiento de las tropas rusas en tsjinvali
2192764 los dirigentes georgianos han recurrido al uso de la fuerza peses a todos los esfuerzos diplom ticos realizados en los contactos entre mosc tiblisi tsjinvali washington y otras capitales preocupadas
2192765 la credibilidad de las autoridades georgianas como participante responsable en el proceso de negociaci n ha quedado completamente minada
2192766 ahora se entiende claramente por qu durante un largo periodo de tiempo tiblisi ha evitado obstinadamente bajo varios pretextos concluir acuerdos legalmente vinculantes con osetia del sur y abjazia sobre el no uso de la fuerza
2192767 no es todav a demasiado tarde para evitar un derramamiento de sangre a gran escala y nuevas v ctimas incluidos civiles
2192768 deber a pensarlo mejor y volver a m todos civilizados de resolver cuestiones complicadas de car cter pol tico

2192771 we certainly hope all members will come to a consensus on allowing an exception for india
2192772 listen to key countries and talk to key countries and japan is certainly one of them
2192773 we do understand that japan is going to ask questions and issues that they want to raise
2192774 but i think those questions and issues do indeed have good answers solid answers because in the end the deal contributes to non proliferation

2192780 blue collar workers in this country and this area need a champion in congress
2192781 someone who will fight for a fair deal for us oppose future fair trade agreements that give unfair advantages to our foreign competitors we believe we have found that champion
2192782 we need somebody like jon in congress who recognizes the needs of working men and women people i call the joes and daves that get up every morning to go to work who clearly dont have a real voice in congress
2192783 were all committed to keeping good jobs in western new york and to building a strong local economy

2192786 kami sudah mengajukan permohonan mudah mudahan kapolda bisa memahami kondisi yang kini dialami persib kami berharap pertandingan itu bisa digelar di stadion siliwangi bandung
2192787 saya kira kalau pun tanpa penonton bagi kami nggak masalah daripada sekarang serba nggak jelas
2192788 secara lisan bli sudah oke untuk memundurkan jadwal bli sangat memahami kondisi yang dialami persib namun jika sebelum tanggal 11 agustus 2008 kapolda memberikan izin menggelar pertandingan itu di bandung maka rencana memundurkan jadwal itu batal
2192789 kalau mendukung yang sportif saya berharap bobotoh semakin dewasa saya tidak ingin melihat lagi mobil orang yang nggak berdosa dirusak lambang dan nyanyian bernada rasis juga nggak boleh ada lagi di stadion semua harus sadar akibat peristiwa ini yang rugi persib

2192796 it is an offense to our rational truth revealing god it is an offense to the true work of his son it is an offense to the true work of the holy spirit to use the names of god or of christ or of the holy spirit in any mindless emotional orgy marked by irrational sensual and fleshly behavior produced by altered states of consciousness peer pressure heightened expectation or suggestibility that is socio psycho manipulation and mesmerizm and it is a prostitution of the glorious revelation of god taught clearly and powerfully to an eager attentive and controlled mind what feeds sensual desires pragmatically or ecstatically cannot honor god you have to preach the truth to the mind

2192807 as played by abigail breslin with her trademark youthful intelligence nim is endearing enthusiastic resourceful and imaginative
2192808 its a fun story particularly in its playful creative sense of the relationship between fiction and reality
2192809 its hard to imagine kids not enjoying the goodhearted lovingly shot fantasy of it all and breslin is charming
2192810 t his three pronged adventure story set largely on a remote island in the south pacific is pacy pretty and generally good fun
2192811 the kinetic camerawork nails every riffnwriggle an impeccably shot snapshot of a band taking their calling to its limit
2192812 the director cannily sprinkles concert footage with archival clips charting the rock veterans rise and the unflappable wit and resolve with which they managed it
2192813 what shine a light martin scorseses concert documentary does beautifully is illuminate the way things are now with the self described worlds greatest rocknroll band
2192814 as you scrutinize the aging bodies of the rolling stones in martin scorseses rip roaring concert documentary shine a light there is ample evidence that rock n roll may hold the secret of eternal vitality if not beauty
2192815 this you are there spellbinder is a master director shining his light on the best rock band on the planet
2192816 scorseses camera work takes its cues from micks moves its nervous yet centered leaping across the stage to gape at the singer awesome propulsion
2192817 shine a light brilliantly captures the stones in all their ecstatic rapture bacchic and sublime
2192818 it is scorseses tribute to the music that shaped his movies and we see the stones through his eyes to him they are immediate they are dynamic they are the best rock n roll band in the world
2192819 t hey remain a vital live force the camera prowls around the stage flitting between the various band members making sense of the barrage of sounds as they tumble out from the speakers
2192820 wenn man die natur einer sache durchschaut hat wird sie berechenbar
2192821 wenn wir alle klone sind warum bin ich der einzige mit humor
2192822 its about a group of people who have formed an organization called
2192823 youve got these subatomic particles accelerated at great speeds for the sole purpose of being destroyed no one thinks of the ethical implications of this theres a limited supply of hadrons in the universe do we just want to go around destroying them what if we run out what if the hadrons can feel pain will we look back at this hundreds of years from now and regret it kinda like we do with the killing of bacteria with antibiotics now
2192824 thats what they said about the other group i founded mothers against undead drivers which warns people of driving while a zombie but theyll see
2192825 when you see r i p you associate that with death so were looking at it as threatening
2192826 we dont know whether this is an organized issue or if its just kids who have had contact with these officers
2192827 these officers have contacted thousands of people all over the city so its difficult to pin down who might be involved
2192828 there are just a lot of people out there who are not very happy with law enforcement right now
2192829 it concerns me that young people feel that way about police officers and we were kind of shocked by that
2192830 weve stepped on some toes over there trying to make that area and all the areas in aberdeen a safe place to work live and visit
2192831 ive got to believe that if they write that on a wall weve stepped on somebodys toes
2192832 the word on the street is if you have certain tattoos on your arms theyre going to stop you that you cant have anything red or blue on you or youre a blood or a crip and theyre going to stop you
2192833 this vehicle belonged to a drug dealer and was seized by your aberdeen police rapid response team
2192834 our patrols in there have made a big difference in the last few years
2192835 were assertive over in that area were diligent in those areas with the street contacts
2192836 we would like to correct suggestions in some sections of the media that the plans have come to a halt whilst we are disappointed that we will not be eligible for funding under the current review we are confident that we can work with the sfc to ensure that the project is given the go ahead at the earliest possible moment reports that we have been turned down for funding are well wide of the mark as we have not yet actually applied for the cash we have submitted an outline business case and this has been well received
2192837 we expect to announce the appointment of a new principal in september with the successful candidate taking up his or her position by the end of the year the new management team will be in place by the end of september
2192838 whilst we are disappointed at the delay we believe that the work we have already undertaken on the project will stand us in good stead when the sfc are in a position to make funds available for the further development of our plans
2192839 our original estimates saw the appointment of a construction company by 2010 and completion by 2012 this latest news would only delay us by an estimated 12 months
2192840 the new management team at kilmarnock college is determined to present the strongest possible case over the coming months for a new college designed to fulfil the needs and aspirations of learners in ayrshire in the 21st century
2192841 we have made giant strides over the past year to improve both the management procedures and educational opportunities within the college and we look forward to a bright and successful future at the heart of kilmarnocks planned regeneration
2192842 the funding council committee have accepted the need for a new college and have praised our outline business case so we are disappointed that funds are not available at this stage

2193075 as our third quarter results illustrate difficult operating conditions in the homebuilding industry persist
2193076 based on these demand dynamics coupled with high supply levels of new and existing home inventory we believe industry conditions will remain challenging for the remainder of this fiscal year and as we enter fiscal 2009
2193077 one thing ive said now for several years is if a company is telling you about the letter i would ask to see the letter because thats the only way to know what the fda said

2193093 the results havent been good but its all about expectations and they could have been much worse than what materialized
2193094 generally the banks that have done relatively well in maintaining profitability are not pure play investment banks
2193095 our conservative funding structure and our position as one of the worlds best capitalized banks remain competitive advantages
2193096 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2193097 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2193098 and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
2193099 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2193100 i used to work for a rodeo contractor who carried a pint of whiskey in his pocket at the end of the night hed say whiskey for my men and beer for my horses that always stuck with me
2193101 it took 10 months to write the beauty of the whole thing was watching it come to life
2193102 tom skerritt really liked it he said whoever wrote it knows the south he said people dont pay attention to the dialogue anymore
2193103 to be working across from them for several days was a thrill for me i was thinking if they were here writing a song with me and trying to sing and not very good at it id be thinking that they have a long way to go i hope they dont feel that way about me but im sure they do
2193104 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
2193105 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
2193106 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
2193107 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
2193108 these two ncos were immature and not ready as far as leading other soldiers and there were some oh shit moments
2193109 we had to have a powwow and pull back on what was going on fortunately no casualties occurred
2193110 we had to spend a lot of time counseling and mentoring these new e5s in the field
2193111 they have their sergeant rank and they still have a lot to learn
2193112 there was an e 4 in my platoon who was very disorganized and didnt care about anyone else he always delegated down the line even when it was his job to do
2193113 im trying to think of the civilian equivalent of how to describe him shit bag is what we called him he had been in the army for a while and boom he got paper boarded
2193114 when i heard he got promoted i said yep thats the only way he would have gotten it
2193115 in infantry platoons too i saw people get promoted who shouldnt have been
2193116 the doctrine now is that you just need to be trainable and people who are not competent and not good leadership material are being promoted
2193117 a sergeant major told me yes youre right but theres nothing i can do about it
2193118 commanders have the responsibility to stop a potential promotion when they determine a soldier is not trained or is in some way unqualified in accordance with standards
2193119 army ncos lead on a very personal level and are the backbone of how the u s army is run
2193120 in combat specialties such as armor and infantry doing two to three tours is having an effect on ncos they have been through a lot and it puts tremendous stress on them and their families
2193121 if these guys dont work for it and you give it to them were not making leaders were making stripe wearers
2193122 the tremendous downtown changes have given the residents a renewed sense of confidence and optimism about the future of the city
2193123 externally its really helped us to reset the image of kansas city
2193124 in order for us to go downtown and bring jobs into downtown we wanted cordish to push along with their plan under a specific timeframe
2193125 we wanted an area that would attract the kind of employees h amp r is looking for
2193126 people are back downtown with their pets with their bikes and vespas
2193127 but the area also provides the best options for larger blocks of space at competitive rates
2193128 most challenging year to date with regard to efforts at the state level to restrict directory publishers ability to freely deliver phone books
2193129 the ones that get used will remain and the ones that dont will go away
2193130 the internet is the sexy new technology out there but it isnt where most of their money is coming from its coming from the mom and pop stores that want to be in that yellow pages book
2193131 if there are three publishers including a small independent that gets maybe 20 percent of the usage most businesses are going to want to have access to that 20 percent
2193132 they delivered two to the house across the street and its been vacant since last october

2193204 hes a little fat because now the lifestyle is high and we eat well
2193205 yeah saturday and sunday are days when there can be some tryouts
2193206 some guys who maybe dont perform very well in the game weve given them some time to show us that definitely could be a possibility
2193207 some guys theyre doing what they can in this format but now theyve got to go to the next level
2193208 the third moment in the great democratic experiment launched by

2193219 i can definitely see that theres this weimar republic cabaret attitude in there
2193220 but if you take it all together with the blues elements and the rock elements there is a melodic pop sense to all the songs
2193221 when we were doing the song allen in february and march it was this really fun classical pop arrangement
2193222 this is the kind of movie i would run out to see
2193223 the kind of movies i watch are definitely guys movies this is departed this is fear this is all those characters times 10
2193224 i did one other cameo in the entourage pilot but i didnt get to do a scene with jeremy piven
2193225 this time its me and piven going at it so it was fun
2193226 man is born broken he lives by mending the grace of god is the glue
2193227 they write great songs and then the sound just blew me away
2193228 ive been into the new folk and the old as well as rolling stones and this has all of that and more
2193229 we are wrong to speak only of the ambition and pride of popes and prelates of their ardent self interest in trying to control temporal matters there was here a genuine concern for the world there was a conviction that they had the key to wisdom and justice for the world they thought that they could give the world just and good institutions in which men could live both as christians and as true men in this regard the medieval churches mounted a positive operation except for one thing it demanded suppression of freedom everything else was catered for everything was foreseen and calculated an advance for better truth and fuller justice but the manifestation of freedom was out of the question this is the one dimension that has been missing in the church from the very first but this is the decisive dimension without which the christian life is without significance for the world in the absence of freedom the forms of the churchs actions have all become legalistic here is the real betrayal
2193230 i purposely did this particular album trying to cater to the country market to see if i could still get some play
2193231 it takes a lot of money to look this cheap
2193232 im just a backwoods barbie too much makeup too much hair dont be fooled by thinking that the goods are not all there
2193233 we made really good progress considering this is the first time weve had the dallara here
2193234 qualifying went well i think of course you want to be p1 but i had a pretty good lap sitting third is a good place to start here because it gives you an opportunity to lead going into the first corner the key now is to work on the car and have a really good race car so were quick for the long runs i think were looking pretty good for tomorrow the track is basically the least technical track that we go to its basically just like an oval and the times are really close among most of the cars in the field so its going to come down to who makes the least number of mistakes
2193235 the team told me on the radio what the no
2193236 i probably just took it into the bus stop a little too much but that was the only way we were going to potentially get the pole it didnt work we cant make up that much time in the corners we are starting fourth thats not a bad position the car feels good but its just going to be a difficult race some of the other guys are fast they are just really fast
2193237 i am not happy with the car it is in no way like it was at montreal we made some progress today but we are not as good as last week we are pretty close right now and we have one more practice before the race to work it and we have a long race ahead of us tomorrow
2193238 i havent been around a lot cars out there so it is hard to compare our top speed setup wise we may have a few tenths or so improvement in the car we took some downforce off of the car for qualifying and that helped our time we are going to take some more off for the night practice and see how much more we can improve without sacrificing the corners too much
2193239 i am happy to be here with the childress howard guys
2193240 we had some teething problems in practice and i only did a handful of laps i really only put together several laps in qualifying we have a pretty good base line setup we will use the practice tonight to fine tune to get some more speed out of the car for the race
2193241 i had a pretty good run and then we had the interruption
2193242 i might have had a few more tenths in the car but i am satisfied with the way i qualified we are pretty trimmed out to get all of the top speed we can i have no complaints about the how the car is handling and how i qualified

2193246 germany will be an important rally for everyone as it will set the tone for teams performance on the remaining asphalt rounds of the championship in spain and corsica its even more crucial for us as its the tarmac debut for the new impreza but testing has been very encouraging petter and chris have traditionally been fast in germany and we now have the experience of three rallies to build on
2193247 the weather is very hard to predict in the region and its very easy to get caught out on a stage on a rain shower which completely changes the characteristics of the roads
2193248 the panzerplatte stage on day two is especially unpredictable on grip if dry its phenomenally hard on tyres as its concrete and if wet it can be hard to get heat into the tyres and is very slippery on the wider military roads it is very hard to find the right line as they are so wide and the hinkelstein are designed to lay out the course for slow moving vehicles so its a compromise at high speed its the first time well be using the hard and soft compound pirelli tyres and on day two were back to remote services
2193249 germany is a rally i like but one ive had mixed experiences on its fast but its very unforgiving we have done two days testing in the new car on asphalt and markko has done a few more days so its relatively new for us but things so far are feeling good weve been fast in germany in the past so we will see what we can do there in the new car its a new car on new tyres so there will be a lot of learning for the team but its important ahead of spain and corsica
2193250 we were fast in germany last year but this year we have a new car on new tyres and the first rally on tarmac so its hard to know where we are speed wise the test there went well and if we can carry the same form we had last year it would be good it was great in finland to get a podium as our first points score with the new car as it does build confidence the more time you spend in the car the more confident you get with it we will go there pushing hard and get a gauge of our performance and then see how we go from there but im looking forward to it
2193251 by staying on the drag strip and then heading back into the esses turn 8 we create a harder braking area and thus a better passing zone going into turn 7
2193252 i think its going to make an improvement for the race
2193253 hopefully its going to create a passing opportunity for some people i think its a good choice and will make a great addition to the weekend
2193254 eliminating the bend to the left and now going up the drag strip makes for a wider passing opportunity and i think thats good
2193255 any passing opportunity is great for the series and good for the fans who come out and watch
2193256 im looking forward to getting back in the no 32 this weekend
2193257 ive never raced at nashville superspeedway but im confident that mike chaffee crew chief will have a good setup that we can adjust from and put ourselves in contention saturday afternoon
2193258 were back in the heart of country music and i hope we can acquire our own record album this weekend were glad to have james aboard for one of the most prestige events of the year were bringing a good car and i think with the results of the open test well easily find ourselves in the top 10 this weekend

2193292 the question is not whether social conservatives will hold their noses and vote for mccain its will they knock on doors and plant yard signs
2193293 we dont have any faith that he will be consistent on the moral issues we really care about
2193294 putting gov huckabee on your ticket will immediately excite mobilize and activate a key grass roots constituency that is essential to your success
2193295 my fear is that there would be a lot of women and any number is too many who would say i think i will stay home
2193296 my mother was there with me for the birth but my dad hasnt met her and keiths mum and dad are coming down
2193297 she has got a little bit of hair it has a bit of a reddish tinge
2193298 its something my parents instilled in me i cant relate to stuff like lucky socks or rabbits feet

2193308 by the time theyre taking the psat its much too late to determine whether they should be taking algebra in the eighth grade biology and other important gatekeeper classes needed for college
2193309 this test will help schools identify students who have some talent and could likely succeed if they take honors or ap courses but have not been recognized
2193310 just because you go to a public school you should still have the same opportunities
2193311 if you want your kid to go to a highly selective institution you really do have to know in the eighth grade
2193312 theyre locked in a death match with act over who takes the act or the sat once you buy into a certain product line youre likely to stick with it
2193313 by the time they apply to school the results would not be relevant
2193314 that plays out in kids real lives most of them are taking a hodgepodge of classes and by the end of 11th grade its too late
2193315 eighth grade is not the key year for college assessment thats sixth grade
2193316 now were going to have a preadmission test to get ready for the preadmission test get ready to get ready to get ready
2193317 to believe you need an eighth grade test on top of the psat and sat is just insane
2193318 we have people in sacramento and in political offices that think that accountability is testing and accountability is not testing
2193319 the eighth grade california standards test should tell us how children are prepared for high school im not sure we need it again in the ninth grade in the 10th grade and then the 11th grade teachers are so loaded down with tests they have very little time to teach anymore
2193320 our primary purpose is to check on how effectively are schools preparing students and we see them as very important
2193321 california has a very shabby test setup a lot of these testing outfits are entrepreneurial theyre trying to make a buck
2193322 if there is a market to be served to add another test theyre more than willing to do that but if the test is well conceived it will have an instructional yield
2193323 once again the texas education agency has turned a blind eye to the dropout crisis in texas
2193324 the agency has declared that its academically acceptable for one third of all students to drop out and for one half of hispanics to do the same to whom is this acceptable
2193325 we need an accountability system that is honest about where we are today and most importantly that sets a goal of high school graduates that are ready to compete in the work place and who will go on to post secondary education
2193326 we cannot have a first rate public education system in texas with a second rate accountability system
2193327 school finance fix of 06 wouldnt do anything to help the gops chances around texas november
2193328 the employers of texas pay for about two thirds of the cost of education in texas today they are in fact the ultimate consumers of the system in that the school system is producing the workforce of the future they are very concerned about both the quality and the quantity of high school graduates in texas

2193331 ok my experience in germany is not as great as some of the other rallies but i know this car is very good on tarmac so i am looking forward to seeing what it can do last time we were on tarmac was way back in january in monte carlo so i think it will take some stages to get used to the feeling again last time we were here was in 2005 and we ended up finishing fifth so another result like this will be fantastic this year the super special on sunday will be amazing it is a beautiful city which is filled with fans who go crazy when the rally is in town
2193332 in the past i have had some very good results here in germany and this year i am in the championship winning car so hopefully this can continue the stages here are quite similar to those in belgium which i think will also help a lot the deal we have struck this year is to do all the remaining tarmac rounds which i am excited about because i know i have the best speed on asphalt hopefully my addition will help the stobart teams chance for more points in the manufacturers championship and also mine in the drivers
2193333 i think this will be a challenging event for me as i have only done the event once before and that was last year but we still need to collect points and the aim is for a good result the best way for me to achieve this is to concentrate on improving my performance from last year and get closer to the top guys times on tarmac then we will see how that leaves us in the overall classification i like the more open normal road stages but find it difficult on the military ranges i need to feel the car flowing and on those stages it is very stop and start and you cant really get into a good rhythm
2193334 we have just come from a difficult rally in finland and now we are going to another one in germany the event is like three different rallies in three days over different types of stages and each with their own unique challenges we will have a test before the rally which will be a huge benefit especially after not having driven on tarmac since january and for sure that will help to give us a good feeling for the start of the event as always the weather here can also make a big difference so the safety crews will have a huge part to play
2193335 the stobart team have a very good chance of scoring well in germany as i feel we are fielding our strongest team to date fran ois record here speaks for itself and i think he will do a great job for the team gigi has been here a few times now so he too will have the experience on what is one of the most challenging tarmac events due to the different characteristics of the stages and the unpredictable weather conditions

2193342 they are quite confident that at the end of whatever this investigation is it will show that they have done their job correctly and honestly
2193343 when we discover irregularities with the services provided by a testing firm we take it upon ourselves to engage another testing company to re inspect and we do what is necessary to ensure the quality of the work and the integrity of the project
2193344 its the only way we know at the onset of the project that the material meets our specs
2193345 because an idea was flawed to an extent in its execution should not in my view be the basis for excluding it under all circumstances in the future

2193349 the key drivers of this performance were production growth in copper iron ore manganese ore coal and phosphates continued strength in the commodity price environment and the early benefits of tighter operational discipline across the businesses

2193357 web 2 0 is really about data and who owns and controls or gives the best access to a class of data i think its about the data thats created by those mechanisms and the businesses that that data will make possible
2193358 attentiontrust is a not for profit organization that puts the user in control of their attention data until now only companies on the other side of our clicking captured the value our attention data has real value and needs to be protected
2193359 we stand here today firmly convinced that we have the person who committed those attacks
2193360 and we are confident that had this gone to trial we would have proved him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
2193361 the governments press conference was an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence all contorted to create the illusion of guilt
2193362 theyve put it all together there is so much that they have gathered and they worked so hard i feel i can rest now
2193363 but the question is does that genetic match match anything else in the world show us the data and lets see it published
2193364 im not going to comment on when the publications and the process will come out but the fbi lab will do that accordingly
2193365 the onset of a yawn triggered by seeing hearing reading or thinking about another person yawn
2193366 during human evolutionary history when we were subject to predation and attacks by other groups if everybody yawns in response to seeing someone yawn the whole group becomes much more vigilant and much better at being able to detect danger
2193367 our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that contagious yawning may be part of a neural network involved in empathy
2193368 it shows an appreciation of other peoples behavioral and physiological state
2193369 we worked with psychologists because they are widely regarded to be more empathetic and engineers because they are often seen as systemizers who are more interested in objects and functions than people
2193370 we found the psychologists yawned contagiously more than the engineers it means they are further along the socialized spectrum they have more social awareness

2193382 we continue to take measures to offset the impact of the current economic environment which is marked by higher raw material costs and more cautious spending by consumers
2193383 as a result of our cost reduction efforts we began to see positive bottom line results at the end of the second quarter
2193384 we remain confident in our ability to manage the business through these challenging times
2193385 i believe this analysis will prove valuable for future policy deliberations if and when the issue of expanded gaming in massachusetts re emerges
2193386 because the energy industry is highly distinct complex and uniquely demanding our technology requirements needed to match our specific needs asset control was the best fit for our criteria for future business functionality performance scalability and robustness the softwares time series calculations were a key factor in our decision as was its ability to streamline data export and data access and reduce risks by allowing a more precise view of data
2193387 we needed a solution that would reduce manual processing and enable our collections team to access client information readily our sister company in france had been using avantgard receivables for years and gave the solution an excellent reference
2193388 following the installation of avantgard receivables in april we have been able to automate a number of manual tasks and have seen an increase in the number of clients our collection staff are contacting per month
2193389 the girls in los angeles were more obsessed with beauty and its because their parents living in los angeles just accepted thats the way it was a lot of the parents in portland and vancouver were more grounded
2193390 you saw a stronger sense of them trying to raise their children i wont say properly but in a way that they werent as affected by the images if youre in a healthy environment it seems to me that you have more stamina and strength
2193391 teenage girls in vancouver werent obsessing about having plastic surgery at 16 whereas that was predominant in los angeles they were still affected but not to the degree they were in los angeles
2193392 she had this meltdown when they told her she was too many centimeters big to model and she began thinking she was ugly
2193393 everyone had been telling her shes beautiful and thats where her self esteem came from but when you get your self esteem from external things it can be taken away from you
2193394 we went back and restructured the whole film and kind of laid the film around the young models story which became a way to explore this bigger broader social issue thats what happens with editing the footage kind of tells you what to do

2193401 our liquidity and financial condition remained strong during the second quarter as of june 30 2008 we had approximately 97 million of liquidity available keeping us well positioned for future operating conditions our free cash flow improved substantially this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year and based on our current outlook we expect to generate positive free cash flow in the second half of 2008
2193402 as we stated last quarter we are facing a challenging environment for volumes going forward and we expect to see continued quarterly decreases in demand on a year over year basis
2193403 we do realize that our end markets are varied and choppy but the fact is that we are rapidly growing in developing countries and that our crane and mining businesses are also growing nicely with excellent margins

2193409 this round of delivery changes the spokesman said affect subscribers in portions of south dakota and wyoming
2193410 so yes this is hardly a move thats going to cause journal circulation to tank but it is a signal that more remote subscribers to the big national papers the journal the new york times and usa today are closer than they may realize to no longer getting their daily paper on the day its published

2193415 most current mobile audio users prefer the ad supported model over paying a subscription fee and this group is a very attractive demographic for advertisers to target as its comprised mainly of affluent tech savvy early adopters

2193423 im the one who played like an idiot who played like a 20 handicap
2193424 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2193425 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2193426 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2193427 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2193428 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2193429 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2193430 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2193431 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system
2193432 mcdonalds clearly continues to be one of the few consistent performers in a challenging consumer sector
2193433 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july
2193434 in addition credit performance has continued to deteriorate and based on our experience in july we anticipate further increases in our combined loss reserves
2193435 we continue to be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2193436 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2193437 candor is most effective when nations have built a relationship of respect and trust

2193449 now dont be too quick to answer there are always two sides to a wish and you cannot undo your wish so like the saying goes be careful what you wish for

2193468 the records are all me as far as the guys in the touring band we just get together before the tour and after the records been made basically having four people really makes everything gel together and allows us to do things we couldnt otherwise do it allows us to go off on tangents and be more comprehensive in the way we play the songs the live show is a collaborative thing we kind of take the record apart and decide which tracks to change and how to play the songs live its not just me telling them then the songs kind of evolve as we tour along but the records are all just me at home
2193469 there are some songs that were never gonna play and thats fine i dont want to not make a track because it wont be able to be played live but also we have the ability to trigger samples on stage so that we dont just have to have songs that are two guitars drums and bass we have more flexibility with that thats an enjoyable part of the process starting with the songs on the record some of them we play fairly faithfully some of them we rework quite substantially when were touring
2193470 one way it did change with this record is that instead of building the tracks out of loops as i did in the past this time i wanted to really write songs and focus on composition writing melodies and harmonies and squishing them into pop song formats i planned out the record i wrote the record before i started recording it whereas in the past i just started a loop and built things on top of it it was more of a premeditated process this time with this album i was trying to make really carefully crafted pop songs carefully arranged its hard to avoid bands like the zombies or the beach boys that kind of style putting together baroque pop music those are definitely two big influences

2193472 i was interested in having a vocal carry the melody of the song more classic song role thats been something thats continued to interest me
2193473 theyre both things that ive done just because i enjoy doing them i started as an undergraduate doing mathematics before i was releasing music it seemed impossible to be releasing records and touring the world then so at that point i was doing mathematics because i loved it but also sure i can imagine being a math professor as music took up more and more of my time i realized this was obviously what i wanted to do but i did want to finish the ph d a lot of people say its good that youve got that to fall back on which i suppose is true but it doesnt have much to do with why i was doing it im the kind of person that im always gonna fill up my time doing things i want to do i rarely sit around and veg out the last year of finishing the ph d and recording the previous album and being on tour all the time was insanely hectic but i enjoyed doing everything i was doing so i wasnt upset

2193515 took incentives to the source of the problem the suburban empty nesters who want to buy in town but cant sell their houses offer to buy down the mortgage for example
2193516 but give it another few months at the sign of the first frost and i think we will be seeing a lot more incentives from developers
2193517 it is their way of dropping their prices without really dropping their prices
2193518 is one way to keep the sale prices at a certain level in the multiple listing service and in the public records because those two sources of comparables dont reflect whether the unit had parking
2193519 when they asked me if it would help i basically told them no one is going to buy a condo at that price just to get a free week in mexico
2193520 it is a nice bonus but would it cause someone to buy a place they werent going to buy
2193521 as you are probably aware babson has begun the process of looking for a new president and steve spinelli has expressed his interest and desire to help lead the college through the next stage as it continues to grow i am writing you because i believe we share a common belief that steve spinelli is the right person for the job as president of babson college indeed in many ways his career in business and his service in academia makes him the perfect babson president he exemplifies the deep commitment to higher education and a bias toward action and connection with the real world that is uniquely babson i believe he will inspire babson in a way that will accelerate the accomplishments and elevate the stature of the college in addition steve will raise more money for babson college than any else

2193532 akil bomani is a member of the chicago writers and artists collective and a correspondent to revolution newspaper
2193533 in the george orwell book 1984 it was the ministry of truth that was responsible for going through libraries and removing all references to unpersons and rewriting the historical accounts to line up with the new facts akil disagreed with the cult of personality and that was intolerable
2193534 stirring controversy wherever they spoke on the airwaves in house meetings and at a full panel discussion at cal state dominguez hills the rc4 kicked off their visit here bringing straight to the people the compelling vision of the communist revolution developed by bob avakian
2193535 bringing straight to the people the compelling vision of the communist revolution developed
2193536 the rcp had very little political influence and connection if any to the african american communities it was trying to reach we entered the communities as outsiders attempting to proselytize the inhabitants to become followers
2193537 but reading preaching from a pulpit of bones inspired me to do something that religion in general denounces think critically so i expanded my research i delved deeper into marxism and perused the bible further for myself to deconstruct all of the paradigms it had for so long instilled into me and so many others
2193538 in the george orwell book 1984 it was the ministry of truth that was responsible for going through libraries and removing all references to unpersons and rewriting the historical accounts to line up with the new facts akil disagreed with the cult of personality and that was intolerable
2193539 ive actually been learning some interesting things from this site so dont take this the wrong way
2193540 isnt what happened to akil and his involvement with the rcp on a smaller level not much different than trotsky being airbrushed out of old photos and even more extreme other old bolsheviks getting bullets in the back of the head
2193541 this is my stop this is where i get off
2193542 a thought experiment what would have happened to akil in stalins russia if he stepped out of line would that have been any different in the alternate universe where bob avakian was running the show in the u s stirring the hornets nest i know but it seems like an obvious point to me
2193543 if you are not with us you are sinister and irredeemable
2193544 it is worth noting that it is the kasama project that has consistently held to the principles and methods once upheld by the rcp and ba
2193545 the method of the communists around the kasama project stands in sharp contrast to the approach of the rcp today
2193546 kasama will hopefully become something concrete i can see that it is starting to take off in a good way while the rcp will continue their garbage about us and tell people they are the vanguard they will not change their politics but they will lose people akil is another one to the list
2193547 allowing even the most reactionary to publish books with state sponsored funds
2193548 we can learn even a bit of truth from them
2193549 its not clear that such a lack of connection and base among the black masses is for any lack of trying
2193550 the question is why such low turnout why were so few if any drawn to the rc line was the festival tailing in nature
2193551 national day of protes against police brutality repression and criminalization of a generation
2193552 as a preponderance of comments which are clearly gradualist and economist fill up his blog
2193553 think that the rcps mass work and base building efforts universally found no resonance with the masses
2193554 given that the kasama website moderators are keeping this piece at the top of the front page despite the fact that newer material has been posted to the website i think it is safe to infer that the moderators believe that the piece and the discussion surrounding it is important
2193555 mike ely once vigorously fought all these ideas tooth and nail even yet now he is strangely silent as a preponderance of comments which are clearly gradualist and economist fill up his blog
2193556 avakian has certainly made very valuable contributions to the field of marxism it was in fact his works that started me along the revolutionary road of communism further his party has made very valuable contributions over its lifetime and i am grateful for what ive learned through my affiliation with them
2193557 avakian has certainly made very valuable contributions to the field of marxism
2193558 this is not to say that rcp has not done great work nor that they are mainly responsible for the failure for revolutionary politics to take hold just the opposite they have done some remarkable work esp around mumia and in the post 9 11 period
2193559 lack of connection and base among the black masses is not for any lack of trying
2193560 this site is a relief but where is it leading
2193561 other than a general commitment to revolution and emancipation what part of marxism leninist maoism do you embrace the idea that the industrial proletariat will be the agent of revolution the emphasis on the peasantry the celebration of stalinism
2193562 i think the idea of the industrial proletariat leading a revolution in the a service based economy would be a rather silly idea

2193578 mungkin bisa dipikirkan cara lain untuk mendarat dekat istana bogor
2193579 ya memang pembangunan helipad telah dilaksanakan sejak dua hari lalu
2193580 sejauh yang saya ketahui kalau di dalam istana kepresidenan bogor saat helikopter mendarat akan menimbulkan kebisingan rusa rusa di dalamnya dan membuat stres satwa itu dan akan membuat beterbangan dedaunan yang ada
2193581 ketika hutan ditebang kami dikecam dan disalahkan namun pihak pihak tersebut hanya bisa menyalahkan tanpa memberi bantuan apa pun untuk pelestarian hutan
2193582 namun kami tidak menerima apa apa dari pemerintah pusat apalagi lembaga swadaya masyarakat yang mendesak kami melakukan konservasi
2193583 karena itu mestinya mulai dipikirkan kompensasi bagi daerah konservasi seperti kabupaten malinau
2193584 padahal untuk memelihara kelestarian hutan butuh biaya yang sangat besar baik untuk pengamanan maupun sosialisasi agar masyarakat tidak merambah hutan

2193586 i am confident the team is up for it as we assemble next wednesday ahead of one of the greatest quests that exists in world rugby the challenge of winning test matches on south african soil
2193587 while that record of not winning in south africa since 2000 has no real relevance in terms of how the two test matches that lie ahead might unfold on the pitch it does highlight the special opportunity we have in front of us as we head to the republic
2193588 as far as our progress as a team goes the auckland experience was a setback but it need not be any more than that
2193589 i would like to think the reverse wont impact too greatly on the confidence that has been built up within the group but that is something well really only be able to judge retrospectively
2193590 what the opening five matches of the tri nations have shown is how tough and tight this years competition is
2193591 its the nature of the beast that you learn the most in times of adversity both about the dynamics of the group and the individuals within it in terms of how they handle times of stress
2193592 brian and i have been talking and taking a look at things come november well take a good look at it and well see how things are going
2193593 at the moment i think its important that he just gets a chance to concentrate on his own game because hes been shouldering things for the last five years
2193594 well see how things go hes done a very good job as captain you dont win three triple crowns and just throw that away too easily
2193595 at the same time you want to give him a small bit of space
2193596 without naming a captain it wouldnt be usual anyway to name a captain at the start of a coaching set up well just see how things go and give him a chance to enjoy his own rugby
2193597 november is probably more important than it ever has been this year in that theres irb world ranking points wherever we stand on december 1 is going to have an effect on the draw for the next world cup
2193598 so it has a three year effect how we go in the next three matches and that will focus minds
2193599 do you really think those shoes are going to make you run faster than that tiger

2193605 sure they do give it to me and it will be fixed
2193606 can i come and watch tv tonight with you because mine is broken
2193607 you dont expect me to believe such rubbish do you there is no way that a lazy lion with big claws can fix a complicated tv

2193627 the rather wobbly legged best guesses for 2008 are that 400 000 gold farmers earning an average us 145 per month produced a global market worth us 500 million but we could easily more than double the latter to over us 1 billion there are probably 5 10 million consumers of gold farming services
2193628 everything you ever wanted to known about gold farming as seen through the multi faceted prism of economic and sociological analysis

2193667 i do not know if he has left yet but he is not practicing with our football team right now

2193670 donald bowens geron james owen spencer those guys know whats going on and have all that experience at the collegiate level that we dont have they help the younger guys out as far as learning how to read coverages things like that it really pays off to listen to them
2193671 we look at how hard those guys work and we try to come out and work just as hard
2193672 we just try to keep up with the pace they usually come out here and set the pace for the younger guys and we just try to follow that and hope we get better
2193673 you need all of it in order to be successful in a game

2193694 just because we have found no evidence of collusion does not mean we have given the big six energy companies a clean bill of health far from it
2193695 it is clear that there are very real problems in the energy markets at all levels and going beyond these six companies which need to be addressed
2193696 will rise significantly in the near future over and above the increases already announced this year
2193697 energy suppliers existing social assistance initiatives which go well beyond specific tariffs do not reach the vast majority of the fuel poor
2193698 this report is yet another nail in the coffin for the governments fuel poverty strategy
2193699 the industry rallied pretty ridiculously to do something about this with hundreds of milllions protected
2193700 in a highly competitive marketplace it is very difficult for one or a few institutions to hold the line on best practices or to stand on the sidelines in the face of booming markets
2193701 financial institutions must be subject to a higher degree of official oversight than is necessary for virtually all other forms of commercial enterprise however official supervision is not a substitute for effective management of financial institutions
2193702 whats needed is a form of private initiative that will complement official oversight by insisting on industry practices that will help mitigate systemic risk
2193703 were very fortunate weve had people come to conshohocken to invest and develop
2193704 at the same time because of the success of conshohocken our change from a blue collar to a white collar community weve lost some things towns can be a victim of their own success its time we add something for the residents
2193705 and we may still move the borough offices in there theres been no decision
2193706 employers who are operating legitimately are getting undercut by those who are operating on the margin
2193707 to the detriment of their employees to the detriment of legitimate employers and clearly to the detriment of the state
2193708 what happens if you slip on the floor if you burn yourself with an iron
2193709 the market is continuing to favor first time home buyers
2193710 sales have been in a pattern of rising and falling within a fairly narrow range
2193711 because higher sales contract activity is necessary for overall recovery
2193712 foreclosure sales undoubtedly are a significant aspect of the improvement
2193713 it is making lots of homes affordable to buyers who have the credit and money but not a lot of income
2193714 everything taken together i believe we have bottomed when it comes to existing home sales
2193715 sales have leveled off recently because banks have been slashing prices on foreclosed homes
2193716 the housing market is continuing to act as a drag on the economy
2193717 how much the housing bill will add to this is unclear but it has to help
2193718 it is hard to imagine myself now from back two years ago
2193719 that growth really introduced me from a mid level player to a high level
2193720 he can shoot the ball he can pass the ball hes got great ball handling skills
2193721 his difference is that he can score in the interior as well
2193722 for me its just got to be a gut feeling because honestly i can fit into a lot of these places
2193723 theres a long line of teachers and coaches in our family so there are plenty of people in his life to make sure he has rocks in his pockets and keeps his feet on the ground
2193724 our ability to run is much better than it was in the spring
2193725 our young guys are providing speed and quickness on the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball
2193726 cameron is stronger and quicker and working like i like to see a guy work
2193727 hes not saying a whole lot but just going about his business and responding to coaching
2193728 i have great respect for jmu they are a bunch of winners
2193729 were trying to be the no 1 defensive line in the nation and the no 1 defense
2193730 you can tell theres a difference in the atmosphere out there at practice when you step on that field when you walk through that gate you just feel electric
2193731 were all competing every day everybody wants it all meals must be finished
2193732 i got hurt against james madison and then i was hurt for a couple of games basically im a big boy and i love to eat so i was gaining weight and then when the ankle started to heal it wasnt healing the way it was supposed to be because i was pounding on it and gaining weight too it was bad
2193733 you can be strong on the field but if you dont have conditioning with it then its basically useless with all that power and no conditioning after two or three plays youre done so i really try to work on conditioning i think im better conditioned this year than i have been in past years
2193734 i just want to do better than my past years
2193735 i played and stuff but i didnt come off like the player that i know i can be the dominant hulk that i can be if we come out like one big fist then nobody can stop us
2193736 its about to come true thats not talk its about to be real were ready were practicing every day like were ready were focused and its about to be the real deal
2193737 im not going to show you ill keep that under wraps but i could do a backflip right now i cant wait
2193738 je suis une femme au foyer des ann es 50 jadore cuisiner jadore la couture etre la maison avec tony ma m re tait comme a elle sest toujours occup e de son mari je lai toujours admir e et jai toujours voulu le faire
2193739 the role of the national system of education in promoting civic behaviour
2193740 in proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened
2193741 it is highly participatory it relates to issues that affect the participants in their daily lives it produces tangible as well as intangible results and it is firmly rooted in the community in which it takes place
2193742 what you are doing today will prepare our students to make the next important transition for china from an authoritarian system to one based on democracy and the respect for human rights
2193743 response to the may 16 2007 release of the 2006 national assessment of educational progress civics report card
2193744 civic education assessment stage ii civic education programming since 1990 a case study analysis
2193745 guidelines for country coordinators in the development of plans to promote the sustainability institutionalization of comprehensive civic education programs in a nations schools
2193746 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
2193747 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2193748 blind people can do better massages because they can concentrate more on small movements and feel things better
2193749 its one of the only types of work i can do and it lets me serve other people and make them more comfortable
2193750 it is a good thing because blind people can now help society and make money
2193751 this piece of legislation provides real relief to westchester families and seniors struggling with escalating property taxes skipping this vote is a clear indication that senator oppenheimer is out of touch with new yorks taxpayers
2193752 an irvington cage fighter accused of inciting a brawl at an auburn university fraternity house by yelling
2193753 and i have to tell you right now i didnt plan to talk about this right now i feel her i feel her presence shes inside me and shes talking to you

2193756 fight in the cause of allah those who fight you but do not transgress limits for allah loveth not transgressors
2193757 and why should ye not fight in the cause of allah and of those who being weak are ill treated and oppressed men women and children whose cry is our lord rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from thee one who will protect and raise for us from thee one who will help
2193758 but if they cease allah is oft forgiving most merciful and fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in allah but if they cease let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression
2193759 to those against whom war is made permission is given to fight because they are wronged and verily allah is most powerful for their aid they are those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right for no cause except that they say our lord is allah did not allah check one set of people by means of another there would surely have been pulled down monasteries churches synagogues and mosques in which the name of allah is commemorated in abundant measure
2193760 i saw the body of a slain woman during one of the battles of the prophet peace be upon him so he forbade the killing of women and children
2193761 we were with allahs messenger peace be upon him during a battle and we saw people gathered together he dispatched a man to find out why they were gathered the man returned and said they are gathered around a slain woman so allahs messenger peace be upon him said she should not have been attacked kh lid b al wal d was leading the forces so he dispatched a man to him saying tell kh lid not to kill women or laborers
2193762 go forward in the name of allah do not kill an elderly person nor a child nor a woman and do not exceed the bounds
2193763 you are going to find a group of people who have devoted themselves to the worship of allah i e monks so leave them to what they are doing
2193764 this is what umar the commander of the faithful grants to the people in peace he grants them the safety of their persons their churches and their crosses their churches will not be shut down nor destroyed nothing will be taken from them or from their crosses they will not be compelled to abandon their faith nor shall any one of them be abused
2193765 its a wedding present from the mackenzies darling and in case you forgot they live just next door it would be simply impolite to not display it especially when they are so fond of seeing it over the fence
2193766 its that bird bryan the bad lucks finally getting to us i told you it was bad luck the birds a curse we were alright before it came
2193767 messenger of god are we rewarded for kindness towards animals
2193768 parliament and all the constitutional and administrative institutions will continue to perform their duties in accordance with the countrys constitution laws and regulations
2193769 for their part municipal councils will continue normal exercise of their mandate the same is true of political parties associations and legally constituted unions will continue to operate freely in accordance with the law
2193770 the freedom of the press and in general other public and individual freedoms will be maintained and respected public order and security also provided
2193771 the high council of state has decided to collectively lead the country during a period which will be the shortest possible with the powers vested to the president of the republic by the constitution
2193772 by virtue of these powers a government will be appointed and entrusted to exercise under the leadership of the president of the high council of state the powers under the constitution
2193773 this provisional institutional mechanism will be built up by provisional constitutional order governing provisional credentials of the high council of state amending as necessary the constitution which will be promulgated in the coming days
2193774 you can create iphone ringtones from many songs purchased from the itunes store
2193775 theyre both running os x on basically the same hardware
2193776 developers and users alike are going to be very surprised and pleased at how great these applications look and work on iphone
2193777 our innovative approach using web 2 0 based standards lets developers create amazing new applications while keeping the iphone secure and reliable
2193778 isupplis sell through research and the subsequent press release indicated that the iphone outsold all smart phone models in july in the united states on an individual basis
2193779 while isuppli stands by this analysis it is important to note that iphones retail sales did not exceed the combined retail sales of the entire blackberry line of smart phones in the united states in july
2193780 as of sunday apple had sold 730 000 units in the quarter which suggests that in the 5 days since the price cut apple has sold 136 000 phones
2193781 this new run rate implies 27 000 iphones per day which clearly represents an initial surge that is not sustainable
2193782 we think windows users are going to be really impressed when they see how fast and intuitive web browsing can be with safari
2193783 hundreds of millions of windows users already use itunes and we look forward to turning them on to safaris superior browsing experience too
2193784 this decision about president musharrafs impeachment is going to open a pandoras box
2193785 there is no doubt he will fight back but given the odds against him and the unity shown by his political opponents inside and outside parliament he would be well advised to decide to bow out gracefully
2193786 if the president does not get the vote of confidence then immediately with it impeachment proceedings will start
2193787 he is the hope of arab and african swimming and he enjoys huge capabilities
2193788 if the swimmer was indeed guilty of negligence such negligence was not sufficiently serious to suspend him for two years
2193789 a group of troublemakers attacked me as soon as i started to speak and i couldnt continue my speech
2193790 you saw what happened you guys saw it theres really nothing for me to say
2193791 i keep talking about this leg im tired about talking about this leg
2193792 yeah but when you come off an injury things kind of change
2193793 you have to come and show a lot of people you were the same back you were before you got injured thats my mindset
2193794 out of respect to our pro bowl player i communicated with him very early on to let him know no 1 we appreciate him and no 2 youll always draft the best player who fits your team and thats what we did and were happy that we did it
2193795 but i think well see a lot of it this year itll make it interesting especially on the pass plays
2193796 youre talking about a guy whos very capable in all areas
2193797 hell get his opportunities and then when the time comes the coaching staff will sit back and say whats best for our offense
2193798 its a natural reaction to the overall intensity of the drill
2193799 actually he has been impressive every time we expose him to something new friday night will be new and different for him
2193800 i like his attention to detail hes a very coachable guy a good worker hes a relatively quick learner all indications of things we focus on have been positive
2193801 we want to get some games under our belts to see what we have but we feel real good about it right now
2193802 thats the beauty of coaching that position the backs generally decide who plays its a real good situation
2193803 i dont know anything other than what happened today on the practice field and i dont want to address any more speculation at this point bretts situation will resolve itself during the coming days i would assume but at this point and time all i can comment on is our football team and what we did today
2193804 we are a good football team were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better
2193805 just how he was doing where he was with the process things like that
2193806 obviously theres no closure as of yet but i think weve kind of been told whats going on and i think we all kind of know where everything stands
2193807 from what i understand for the most part its taken care of
2193808 now its just about the packers and not about the situation its over now from what i understand its pretty much over
2193809 i think for the most part the locker room would have liked to see him back here but like i say once youre on another team
2193810 the process is running its course he is closer to being ready to contribute well continue to monitor it that doesnt mean hell be participating tonight
2193811 clearly if everything is in order they will sell their shares to dan
2193812 the steelers have become what they are now because of one person dan rooney
2193813 other signs of alcohol impairment no more taking the escalator on all fours
2193814 we are committed to improving the fan experience in every way we can
2193815 from the time fans arrive in the parking lot to when they depart the stadium
2193816 wait dont forget your code of conduct i have copies
2193817 as far as i know our fans are great and the people who cheer for us cheer appropriately
2193818 you know its a hostile atmosphere and the key is to make it hostile the right way and i think our fans provide that i know im looking forward to driving across the bridge to the north side on friday night and feeling that energy and excitement because that does not get old
2193819 when you talk about what you look for in a first game youre looking for some young guys not to be surprised by the speed of the game
2193820 hopefully we play to an acceptable standard in terms of assignments but you know first time out there will be those issues
2193821 more than anything were looking for competitors the guys who can step up when the lights are on inside stadiums
2193822 the big thing we want to do is give everyone a chance to at least show what theyre capable of doing
2193823 i think its been one of the more highly contested battles at training camp
2193824 both guys have shown some good things the preseason games will give us more of an indication how this will go
2193825 i feel like im capable of doing a lot of things and come friday night i finally get a chance to show what i can really do
2193826 i am helping to lay up food for the winter
2193827 it is best to prepare for the days of necessity
2193828 if you look at it from a family point of view it will be the good looking very popular younger brother of the other starwood philly airport hotels
2193829 whether or not the softness continues higher airfares will lead to reduced travel translating into lower occupancy
2193830 like other hotel companies is experiencing pressure on its occupancy levels and also cash flows but the company has an extremely strong balance sheet that provides it with great flexibility
2193831 demand in hotel rooms has slid in may and june which is probably a sign of the economy
2193832 its obviously not the best time for a new hotel to open at philly airport
2193833 and its overall occupancy should rebound relatively quickly to regain its usual top spot
2193834 so we didnt feel bringing in and introducing the third of nine starwood brands would cannibalize one of the two
2193835 we are seeing that because of the prices by the airlines for tickets there are people who are actually extending their stay
2193836 very chic almost a mid market type boutique hotel with a streamlined food and beverage element
2193837 people want to see it touch it and most importantly see how it performs against the more established older brands
2193838 most kids will be returning to school in last years duds
2193839 the consumer is taking the mind set that if i dont need it today then i am not going to buy it
2193840 we recognize that we are faced with a continued weak overall economic and retail environment and thus we are managing our inventory and expenditures very tightly
2193841 if you look at it from a family point of view it will be the good looking very popular younger brother of the other starwood philly airport hotels
2193842 whether or not the softness continues higher airfares will lead to reduced travel translating into lower occupancy
2193843 like other hotel companies is experiencing pressure on its occupancy levels and also cash flows but the company has an extremely strong balance sheet that provides it with great flexibility
2193844 demand in hotel rooms has slid in may and june which is probably a sign of the economy
2193845 its obviously not the best time for a new hotel to open at philly airport
2193846 and its overall occupancy should rebound relatively quickly to regain its usual top spot
2193847 so we didnt feel bringing in and introducing the third of nine starwood brands would cannibalize one of the two
2193848 we are seeing that because of the prices by the airlines for tickets there are people who are actually extending their stay
2193849 very chic almost a mid market type boutique hotel with a streamlined food and beverage element
2193850 people want to see it touch it and most importantly see how it performs against the more established older brands
2193851 the filthy lying money grubbing whores we call the airline industry
2193852 i was completely up front with them the entire time when i spoke with jetblue
2193853 i told them that im going to make some noise about this
2193854 the bottom line is that a low price coupon may have gotten me to buy a dell but your product was a lemon and your customer service was appalling
2193855 if we see what appears to be a big customer service problem where we might not have followed through as we would like well definitely get the right people involved and doublecheck
2193856 the more mature the technology the less relevant the show
2193857 this is just the medium that people used now you can go to the web or to your local retailer
2193858 the more mature the technology the less relevant the show
2193859 the market is continuing to favor first time home buyers
2193860 sales have been in a pattern of rising and falling within a fairly narrow range
2193861 because higher sales contract activity is necessary for overall recovery
2193862 foreclosure sales undoubtedly are a significant aspect of the improvement
2193863 it is making lots of homes affordable to buyers who have the credit and money but not a lot of income
2193864 everything taken together i believe we have bottomed when it comes to existing home sales
2193865 sales have leveled off recently because banks have been slashing prices on foreclosed homes
2193866 the housing market is continuing to act as a drag on the economy
2193867 how much the housing bill will add to this is unclear but it has to help
2193868 our phone traffic has quadrupled over july and we expect agreements of sale for all three in a couple of weeks
2193869 there are also a car and driver on call as available for owners in the same manner as those offered to guests of a luxury hotel
2193870 the older buildings have a 1 percent to 1 5 percent vacancy rate wanamaker house has two units of 333 available
2193871 adaptive reuse including parc rittenhouse the ayer and the warwick also one of his buildings are 70 percent to 90 percent sold
2193872 banks must now know they are going to get repaid in order for the draws to pay for continued construction to be given
2193873 took incentives to the source of the problem the suburban empty nesters who want to buy in town but cant sell their houses offer to buy down the mortgage for example
2193874 but give it another few months at the sign of the first frost and i think we will be seeing a lot more incentives from developers
2193875 it is their way of dropping their prices without really dropping their prices
2193876 is one way to keep the sale prices at a certain level in the multiple listing service and in the public records because those two sources of comparables dont reflect whether the unit had parking
2193877 when they asked me if it would help i basically told them no one is going to buy a condo at that price just to get a free week in mexico
2193878 it is a nice bonus but would it cause someone to buy a place they werent going to buy
2193879 the weakened economy driven by tight credit markets declines in consumer confidence and rising oil prices has had a significant impact on the gaming industry across america
2193880 as a result our net revenues and those of many of our competitors have been negatively impacted
2193881 however despite these economic pressures the fundamentals of our business are sound
2193882 cest une attaque de plus contre le pouvoir dachat des familles
2193883 ce sont des augmentations inacceptables au regard des profits consid rables que font gdf suez et edf le gouvernement est v ritablement autiste vis vis de ce qui se passe dans le pays
2193884 nouveau coup dur pour le pouvoir dachat des fran ais en pleine p riode estivale
2193885 le gouvernement nest r ellement contraint dy proc der ni du fait de la hausse du co t du p trole ni en raison de la sant financi re de gdf suez et dedf qui est excellente
2193886 cette hausse ne m tonne pas a partir du moment o gdf a t privatis et d pend de suez nous savions quil y aurait des hausses je pense quil faut sattendre de nouvelles augmentations dans les prochains mois
2193887 aujourdhui rien noblige ce que le co t du gaz soit fix sur le prix du p trole
2193888 le gaz est une nergie part enti re ce nest plus comme il y a 20 ans o c tait un sous produit p trolier
2193889 du cynisme consistant mettre en oeuvre des mesures impopulaires au coeur de l t on peut en revanche sinterroger sur les motivations de cette d cision qui c de aux pressions des entreprises concern es en d pit des tensions persistantes sur le pouvoir dachat des m nages
2193890 inadmissible de prendre de telles mesures sans organiser une concertation avec les repr sentants des usagers
2193891 the system defined default value whatever that is in this revision or build of the system

2193895 im a librarian at a major public library a couple of days ago a woman approached the reference desk and asked about finding local government information in spanish i showed her how to use your language translation page and her response was so enthusiastic i was overwhelmed she told me i opened a whole new world for her it was a great feeling to help this woman

2193899 this is a different crew i think raj will surprise people and ive got a feeling sasha will have a strong meet if he can quit worrying about things and quit trying to be perfect and just compete theres no stopping him
2193900 i signed more autographs in one day here than i had in my entire life
2193901 people dont care who you are they figure your autograph is worth having if youre playing in a major
2193902 if you get it going too sideways you can shoot a million
2193903 i just cant handle this this is no way to play golf
2193904 this course is diabolical its like trying to play scrabble without the vowels
2193905 did you bring the peyote i got some thinkin to do
2193906 yeah saturday and sunday are days when there can be some tryouts
2193907 some guys who maybe dont perform very well in the game weve given them some time to show us that definitely could be a possibility
2193908 some guys theyre doing what they can in this format but now theyve got to go to the next level
2193909 la grande marcia della distruzione intellettuale proseguir tutto sar negato tutto diventer un credo e una posizione ragionevole negare le pietre della strada diventer un dogma religioso riaffermarle e una tesi razionale quella che ci vuole tutti immersi in un sogno sar una forma assennata di misticismo asserire che siamo tutti svegli fuochi verranno attizzati per testimoniare che due pi due fa quattro spade saranno sguainate per dimostrare che le foglie sono verdi in estate noi ci ritroveremo a difendere non solo le incredibili virt e lincredibile sensatezza della vita umana ma qualcosa di ancora pi incredibile questo immenso impossibile universo che ci fissa in volto combatteremo per i prodigi visibili come se fossero invisibili guarderemo lerba e i cieli impossibili con uno strano coraggio noi saremo tra quanti hanno visto eppure hanno creduto
2193910 by measuring the air quality in both areas we will be able to show the efficacy of the bricks
2193911 the province of overijssel sees an opportunity in these bricks to improve air quality
2193912 this trial project is of great significance for the entire country
2193913 as long as you can put up with the filming
2193914 but in never send them i put them in a drawer
2193915 the screenings have been going really well and people seem to love the movie
2193916 wrangler anatomy of an icon is a perfect addition to our mini film fest
2193917 we included the film in our theatrical tour because not only is it entertainingly informative and full of archival footage from vintage gay and straight films that jack wrangler starred in but it is an essential piece of adult film history that with a theatrical release will have an opportunity to be discovered by film audiences
2193918 was a hero to gay men who were just coming out
2193919 his fantasies were macho guys so thats what he became he played against stereotypes he helped to give men the confidence to be themselves because he was confident in who he was
2193920 hes very comfortable with his past he doesnt try to hide it
2193921 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2193922 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2193923 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2193924 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2193925 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
2193926 i always wanted to be a packer and i think i always will be a packer

2194039 i used the session this morning to basically find my feet and gain a good level of understanding of how the airwaves ducati works around here in this afternoons practice i went for a long run of laps and still managed to improve upon my fastest time from this morning which im happy about i now just need to get my head down and work on reducing my lap times further for qualifying tomorrow
2194040 it really never had any momentum in the u s whatsoever

2194055 the conservartors centre is proud to contribute these tigers toward the restoration of the baghdad zoo and the important education work it will engage in over the next decade
2194056 after 13 days of the us occupation we found the animals in miserable conditions
2194057 only a few of the bigger animals were still alive such as four lions and three bears
2194058 we have forgotten this matter as it is in the past and the us apologised
2194059 we did not use to come here much but after we heard that there are new animals we wanted to look around especially for our kids

2194064 it would be a grave mistake for some in the bush administration to undermine the effort to bring to justice those who perpetrated the cowardly attacks against the us by trying to implement their own ideologically driven agenda on iraq
2194065 he was right about x thereofre he must be right about y
2194066 the jet would have a range of about 500 miles great enough to reach targets in israel as well as most of the u s force concentrations in the persian gulf he said
2194067 brandon served as an infantry officer in the u s armys 101st airborne division in afghanistan and iraq in march 2002 he led a rifle platoon into afghanistans shah e kot valley in order to engage taliban and al qaeda fighters as part of operation anaconda a battle later written about by award winning journalist sean naylor in not a good day to die a year later brandon commanded a heavy weapons platoon during the invasion of iraq he led troops during combat operations in hillah baghdad and tal afar
2194068 naieve you were just offered about 6 links above you that said no wmds none made after 1991
2194069 500 shells of out of date barely chemically potent mustard gas and sarin sounds like a good reason to send 4000 american soldiers and who knows how many innocent iraqis to their deaths
2194070 i think the danger right now is that without effective inspections without effective monitoring iraq can in a very short period of time measured in months reconstitute chemical and biological weapons long range ballistic missiles to deliver these weapons and even certain aspects of their developing of nuclear weapons program
2194071 theres no doubt iraq hasnt fully complied with its disarmament obligations as set forth by the security council in its resolution but on the other hand since 1998 iraq has been fundamentally disarmed 90 95 of iraqs weapons of mass destruction capacity has been verifiably eliminated we have to remember that this missing 5 10 doesnt necessarily constitute a threat it constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesnt amount to much but which is still prohibited we cant give iraq a clean bill of health therefore we cant close the book on their weapons of mass destruction but simultaneously we cant reasonably talk about iraqi non compliance as representing a de facto retention of a prohibited capacity worthy of war
2194072 the second phase is iraq there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
2194073 iraq made commitments after the gulf war to completely dismantle all weapons of mass destruction and unfortunately iraq has not lived up to its agreement
2194074 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons hes had those for a long time but the united states right now is on a very much different defensive posture than we were before september 11th of 2001 he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
2194075 the community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat iraq poses now a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists if we fail to respond today saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow
2194076 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of september 11 2001 it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons should he succeed in that endeavor he could alter the political and security landscape of the middle east which as we know all too well affects american security
2194077 iraq does pose a serious threat to the stability of the persian gulf and we should organize an international coalition to eliminate his access to weapons of mass destruction iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to completely deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
2194078 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
2194079 there is no doubt that saddam husseins regime is a serious danger that he is a tyrant and that his pursuit of lethal weapons of mass destruction cannot be tolerated he must be disarmed
2194080 w e need to disarm saddam hussein he is a brutal murderous dictator leading an oppressive regime we all know the litany of his offenses he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation and now he is miscalculating americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction that is why the world through the united nations security council has spoken with one voice demanding that iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real but it is not new it has been with us since the end of the persian gulf war
2194081 he had a fixation on a sorority at princeton near where the letters were mailed
2194082 i remember listening to scott ritter on many news channel practically begging america to listen and to not support the war mongers
2194083 knowing what we know now and that not a thing has been done about it is just too depressing even acknowledge anymore
2194084 what makes you liberals so sure there are no wmds in iraq because they told you so
2194085 andy by the way why do liberals always stick up for the muslim jihadist isnt islam exactly the polar opposite of liberalism you whine about conservatives but islam chops of the heads of gays is against free speech is for a religious ran world and the list goes on funny how you all go to bed with such stange bedfellows

2194113 nothing in life is to be feared it is only to be understood
2194114 theres a body of opinion in the town which feels this is not a suitable film to be shown we ought to see the film first unless one has seen it one cant say what its like
2194115 some people go regularly to the cinema regardless or what the film is i understand that at grimsby some people were fainting at every performance
2194116 i am bothered about the immature adults and the people who are under age and will get in to see it it happens with every film
2194117 as we have a responsibility in law we ought to exercise it on behalf of those who are immature and might well receive some damage to their lives by seeing it
2194118 we have a right to protect the weaker even at the expense of denying the stronger
2194119 the ultimate is to allow everything unchecked unchallenged i believe there must be certain checks and safeguards within our society
2194120 we are pleased to have the co operation of the cinema manager in this regard i think this is quite a new approach
2194121 i wouldnt condemn the film as such its a very powerful art form its very strong meat and not everyone is capable of seeing it and not being bothered about it
2194122 if people are of a nervous disposition or if they have had any deep psychological problems in recent years or if people have a squeamishness about physical things like sick and blood and are put off by hospitals then they ought not to go

2194147 i really enjoyed just being in a race car again and the test has increased my anticipation for the petit le mans in october
2194148 ive wanted to drive a p1 car for a very long time so its exciting to finally get that opportunity the test went really well and the car felt superb and very good to drive creations regular drivers jamie campbell walter and stuart hall were also around to give me some tips and i found that really helpful the team are very professional and have a great track record and im confident well work well together
2194149 ive been waiting a long time to get back to the alms
2194150 i have so many friends there and really enjoyed my time in the championship ive had a lot of success there in the past and hopefully that will continue
2194151 it took us 18 months to get liz in our car and we are delighted that she will be with creation for the final two races of the american le mans series despite having been out of the cockpit for more than a year she was quickly up to speed during the test and we believe there is even more to come liz is very well known to fans of the alms and will be a strong complement to our two car end of season effort
2194152 as a driver i would love to run the whole series
2194153 were bringing a new engineer to kentucky and we developed a great baseline which will give us a great starting point on friday
2194154 we still need to run in traffic and when we get back on track well be able to do that its just when you havent been running all year its a little bit more difficult but thats where my experience and my background is going to come in and help us
2194155 the kentucky weekend will be their first exposure to indycar racing so were trying to do the best job we can and get them involved so that they really love it and want to come back
2194156 were certainly not racing for points so to go out there and get a top 10 would be like a win though im selfish and i want a top 5 were going to work really hard to be consistent and come away with a good finish
2194157 as a driver i would love to run the whole series
2194158 there arent as many ovals as there used to be but certainly even that would be a program we would be proud of
2194159 its been a long break since le mans and that gave me a chance to take a couple of days off and continue my physical training but now were a week away from the next race and im really looking forward to it we had a two day test at magny cours this week and the minute i stepped back in the car i realised just how much ive missed it having such a good race at le mans was a real high but we still remember what happened at spa and were determined to put things right at this race
2194160 its a very physically demanding circuit because its so twisty with a lot of directional changes youre busy throughout the lap and so is the car the track is basically the complete opposite of a circuit like le mans the nature of the layout will also play into the hands of the quickest lmp2 cars theyre quite a bit lighter and thats a massive advantage at the nurburgring because raw power is less important than somewhere like spa the porsche spyders in particular will be mixing it with the lmp1 cars
2194161 the test at magny cours went very well and we managed a lot of track time we were successful in getting through our entire workload ahead of the race i dont think that chief engineer claude gallopin and the guys have had much time for a holiday this summer because theyve done a lot of work to modify the aero package for the nurburgring we have more downforce and on old tyres we were quicker than weve ever been at magny cours before i have to give full credit to the team because they havent relaxed after le mans but continued to push forward with the development of the car to make us even more competitive in the final two rounds of the season
2194162 i cant envisage the order at the front changing too much so the diesel powered peugeots and audis will still dominate but our aim is to fight with the courage orecas creations and the lola aston martin and top the petrol class the three points we lost at spa has made the battle to be the best placed petrol car very tight and we have a real fight on our hands to maintain our position in the championship but its still achievable
2194163 we have a lot of landscape businesses in the area
2194164 we thought it would be a good opportunity for them to do something
2194165 the contest gets a lot of attention in other counties where it is done
2194166 it is more of a spectator thing people love to see machines in action kids love them

2194169 when i wasnt looking my co worker signed me up
2194170 i think it is a great idea especially for me its great publicity
2194171 nascars most recent research shows only 6 percent feel negative about toyotas participation
2194172 toyotas most recent market research dovetails closely with overall acceptance increasing since 2004 to 49 percent and negative responses falling to 9 percent
2194173 at this stage in the process we wanted to ask people how they generally feel about nuclear power
2194174 as the study progresses and viable areas for possible sites are identified we will look at support levels for building a facility in a specific location
2194175 i think most of the people that we encounter really just want to know the facts and want to base their decision whether to support or not to support a new facility in their province based on facts so we find that encouraging
2194176 now as you may know there are many ways to produce electricity including nuclear will you please tell me if you somewhat support strongly support somewhat oppose or strongly oppose nuclear energy
2194177 one example would be that it would declare that nuclear is clean it doesnt pollute and i wanted to be able to say well maybe it doesnt produce carbon dioxide as a waste but in terms of its production in terms of its waste products and so on
2194178 those are things that this survey just didnt allow you to express

2194183 ok so when am i not going for wins when is a driver not going for win
2194184 we dont go for wins any harder than we always do i dont think there is a driver thats ever driven in this series that aint trying to win i get sick of that i get sick of hearing about that whether we try to go for wins harder we go for them as hard as we can all the time
2194185 its really no different regardless of the points and regardless of the time of the season
2194186 well i would trade my season with kyle any day
2194187 hes had a great year and won a lot of races hes a real amazing talent behind the wheel
2194188 i would like to have had the type of season hes had regardless of where that put me on the radar i would like to give my sponsors the best opportunity they can get and the most exposure they can get winning races is how you do it

2194198 i told him he probably would have some issues with my caucus
2194199 it was like they were voting a political agenda as opposed to doing their job that was the concern
2194200 i felt there was too much emphasis being placed on people who were in this country illegally and not enough for people who are here legally
2194201 i dont think that the community college board will decide that they are going to be so political
2194202 i think maybe they will focus on their mission which is provide the best education they can to the students at the community colleges
2194203 the governor appoints the best and most qualified individuals to serve the people of california and randal certainly falls into that category
2194204 by the time theyre taking the psat its much too late to determine whether they should be taking algebra in the eighth grade biology and other important gatekeeper classes needed for college
2194205 this test will help schools identify students who have some talent and could likely succeed if they take honors or ap courses but have not been recognized
2194206 just because you go to a public school you should still have the same opportunities
2194207 if you want your kid to go to a highly selective institution you really do have to know in the eighth grade
2194208 theyre locked in a death match with act over who takes the act or the sat once you buy into a certain product line youre likely to stick with it
2194209 by the time they apply to school the results would not be relevant
2194210 that plays out in kids real lives most of them are taking a hodgepodge of classes and by the end of 11th grade its too late
2194211 eighth grade is not the key year for college assessment thats sixth grade
2194212 now were going to have a preadmission test to get ready for the preadmission test get ready to get ready to get ready
2194213 to believe you need an eighth grade test on top of the psat and sat is just insane
2194214 we have people in sacramento and in political offices that think that accountability is testing and accountability is not testing
2194215 the eighth grade california standards test should tell us how children are prepared for high school im not sure we need it again in the ninth grade in the 10th grade and then the 11th grade teachers are so loaded down with tests they have very little time to teach anymore
2194216 our primary purpose is to check on how effectively are schools preparing students and we see them as very important
2194217 california has a very shabby test setup a lot of these testing outfits are entrepreneurial theyre trying to make a buck
2194218 if there is a market to be served to add another test theyre more than willing to do that but if the test is well conceived it will have an instructional yield

2194252 weve done mushrooms garlic asparagus and weve tried berries we find root crops and vegetables work very well in the system
2194253 we cube our products to five millimetres and run it on the conveyor under the infrared heat
2194254 infrared is an interesting system because the reflective heat off the product is very high
2194255 having this rigid economic model five hundred units will not stand
2194256 its so sad to hear our little village center disappearing
2194257 it is a very difficult layout to get retailers to want to come to it
2194258 you dont want to be stuck with 100 000 square feet of retail thats not leasable
2194259 i think its a perfectly wonderful plan i wish you would put it somewhere else theres nothing wrong with the viability of this village
2194260 where people have to get into their cars to go to the grocery store
2194261 road conditions are the single most important factor on this rally
2194262 if the weather is dry then its an enjoyable event with some fast and flowing stages but if it rains the roads can be treacherous the rain is often localised as well which would make it difficult to judge what compound of tyres to use
2194263 its good to be first in the start order here although on asphalt the advantages and disadvantage arent as great as on gravel the first cars pull mud and dirt onto the road so it makes it harder for those lower down the order its good to test just before the rally especially after a fast smooth gravel event like finland baumholder is always rough and bumpy while the mosel stages are fast and the car can bounce around a lot so its good to get used to these conditions in advance
2194264 i had two really good days covering 230km on the first day and 200km on the next it was 30 c and clear blue skies so i hope the rally is like that i learned a lot about the tyres and i believe i have a better set up for this rally than the last asphalt event in monte carlo when the series switches from one surface to another and especially after a long time away from asphalt its important to have the chance of a good test with plenty of kilometres
2194265 the weather is so important on this rally if its wet then the countryside stages in saarland are difficult if its dry the vineyard stages are the trickiest theyre very technical roads with many tight junctions and the surface is always dirty there will be many asphalt specialists to battle with here but i posted good times on the final day in monte carlo so a top five finish is my target
2194266 asphalt isnt my favourite surface but you have to adapt your style and technique to suit different terrains i learned some important lessons last year which will help my pace notes and speed i finished 16th so im aiming to improve on that the field is huge so breaking the top 10 will be tough but if i can finish in the top 14 keep learning post some fast stage times and enjoy myself ill be happy
2194267 the hardest part of this to understand i dont understand how people do that
2194268 i feel very sad that this whole event took place
2194269 i wanted to apologize to him and his wife and daughters i love them and miss them very much
2194270 the result brought monterey bay to its knees and prevented us from pursuing an expansion opportunity that could have resulted in very rewarding jobs for maryland professionals

2194284 i didnt have the offseason program but i felt like i did some things well
2194285 if you play feeling any pressure youre not going to be in a state of mind to be successful
2194286 if youre the third or fourth guy you dont get to play in the preseason
2194287 its certainly different even today not taking reps with the ones the first team in the last practice before a game is something different
2194288 if i got to pick i wouldnt pick going third

2194312 saya mendapat hiv aids dari suami saya yang sekarang sudah meninggal saya kaget sekali saya sangat stres saya tidak tahu suami saya tertular darimana karena sejak dia bertugas di asmat tidak ada kejujuran saya ketahuan positif hiv aids tahun 1999 disaat suami saya meninggal karena hiv aids anak saya ada tiga yang bungsu sudah meninggal pada umur 6 bulan karena tertular hiv aids mungkin karena saya telah terkena hiv aids dan sedang mengandung dia saya merasa sangat berdosa terhadap anak saya yang ketiga itu
2194313 nona yully m saya berusia 25 tahun saya tidak tamat sd karena saya putus sekolah di kelas dua sd saya menjadi pekerja seks komersial psk karena ketika kedua orang tua saya meninggal saya diangkat oleh sebagai anak pertama dari 7 bersaudara oleh keluarga mahuze tetapi saya sering dipukuli diusir dari rumah karena dianggap bukan anak akndung dan menyusahjan keluarga bapak mahuze saya menjadi psk untuk menghidupi diri sendiri oleh karena itu setiap malam saya berpindah dari pelukan satu laki laki ke laki laki lain uang yang saya peroleh sebagai psk rata rata rp 20 000 rp 50 000 per tamu dari penghasilan saya itu saya harus membayar germo mami perkamar rp 5 000 satu kali perorang kalau menginap di bayar ke germo rp 50 000 perorang kadang melayani tamu tanpa membayar tantangannya sering melayani tamu pada saat mabuk dan sering dipukul dengan paksan dan dilayani tanpa membayar saya berkeinginan untuk keluar dari masalah ini tapi tidak punya modal dan melihat beberapa teman terinveksi hiv aids ada perasan takut jangan sampai terinveksi juga setiap tiga bulan sekali pemeriksaan kesehatan yang dilakukan oleh yasanto pokja dan rumah sakit
2194314 kami tidak pernah mendapatkan dana dari pemerintah atau dari luar negeri untuk menangani masalah hiv aids setiap penderita hiv yang ditemukan di rumah sakit ini kami selalu memberikan rujukan ke pokja tetapi kami di sini punya 3 tiga orang tenaga yang dilatih untuk masalah hiv aids
2194315 ini adalah ungkapan dari pihak rumah sakit bundah pengharapan merauke
2194316 jujur saja kalau mau dilihat lsm lsm yang ada di kota merauke itu kerjanya apa lsm hanya tahu kampanye tentang masalah hiv aids ini adalah masalah yang serius lsm hanya sibuk mengatakan kepada lembaga donor bahwa kami di merauke mengadapi masalah hiv aids yang sangat serius tetapi kami tidak punya dana anda lembaga donor yang punya dana tolong bantu kami setelah dananya ada itu kemana kami para odha yang selama ini dimintai keterangan untuk buat proposal dana tidak pernah merasakan dana itu penderitaan kami dijual demi kenikmatan pribadi
2194317 kalau kita lihat dari jumlah penderita ibu ibu rumah tangga menempati urutan kelompok 4 terbesar yang terinveksi hiv aids ini adalah cermin dari kaum perempuan yang selalu menjadi korban perempuan papua selatan sering dijadikan objek pelampiasan nafsu dan kekecewaan kaum lelaki
2194318 keadaan ini bisa terjadi karena dominasi laki laki yang begitu besar dalam kehidupan keluarga
2194319 lebih baik tempat tempat pelacuran tersebut ditutup dan para perempuan psk dikirim kembali ke daerah asal mereka apabila ada psk yang telah tertular penyakit hiv sebaiknya mereka dikarantinakan sehingga tidak menularkan penyakit hiv aids kepada orang lain mereka dipemeriksa dan diberi pengobatan secara baik
2194320 dengan adanya penyakit hi aids ini kami merasa bahwa akan terjadi pembunuhan terhadap generasi kami orang papua
2194321 pada umumnya odha hanya dijadikan sebagai objek untuk mendapatkan bantuan dana dari luar dan dalam negeri sedangkan si odha hanya boleh pasrah kepada yang maha kuasa inilah yang terjadi dengan kami para odha saya kira suatu saat kami orang papua akan punah di tanah leluhur kami ini

2194345 well the baby was fussy i was trying to figure out what he wanted

2194347 era giunto il momento per istituire uninchiesta su come sono stati costruiti quegli assi al di fuori di ogni canone di normalit
2194348 i did not do this for you god is here working through me to give you hope

2194350 we have an unexpected baby boy do you want him
2194351 if you live each day as if it was your last someday youll most certainly be right
2194352 if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today
2194353 you mean your brother gave it to you and it didnt cost you nothing
2194354 would you like to take a ride in my automobile
2194355 mister would you mind driving in front of my house
2194356 there she is buddy just like i told you upstairs his brother gave it to him for christmas and it didnt cost him a cent and some day im gonna give you one just like it then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the christmas windows that ive been trying to tell you about
2194357 everything is ok in the end if it is not ok then it is not the end
2194358 carly if anything u probably has more in common with these students now than u did before
2194359 what u are is gods gift to you what u make of yourself is your gift to god
2194360 you know carly im really sorry i know weve had this planned for a long time but this customer has a favorite restaurant here in washington d c and they really want to go to that restaurant and we need to do what the customer wants and so i dont think youll be able to join us
2194361 you know i hope it wont make you too uncomfortable but i think im going to come to lunch anyway
2194362 what benefit will it be to you if you gain the whole world but lose your soul
2194363 he is the leader of this team he is an outstanding leader he talks the talk but then he does it on the field
2194364 i dont feel its an important topic all the veterans lead either youre a vocal leader or you lead by example or you do a little bit of both at some point in the season you need everybody to step up and pull his own weight
2194365 i think being a leader youve got to not be afraid to call people out not be afraid to ruffle some feathers
2194366 a good leader isnt somebody whom everybody likes but somebody everyone respects everybody does like rowand because hes got a good personality and he will talk to you but hes not a guy whos going to beat around the bush if he doesnt like something hes going to speak his mind
2194367 what makes him a leader is whatever he says whatever he puts out there he backs up
2194368 hes in his office doing his stuff on every club you need guys to take on that role because were the ones spending the majority of the time with each other its not the managers job to baby sit
2194369 its up to the older guys on the team to help the younger guys out to mentor to police to be the guys who are responsible for bringing everyone together for one common goal to win ballgames together as a unit
2194370 it was his clubhouse but he didnt want that role he wanted the title he wanted it to be his clubhouse but he didnt want to do the team building stuff so we kind of worked around that we didnt have one leader
2194371 id be lying to you if i didnt say at times that can be difficult
2194372 because when youre not getting the results you want its real easy to not be as exuberant or as vocal as you probably want to be
2194373 i wouldnt do or say anything that i wouldnt do to myself
2194374 im not better than anybody else in this clubhouse i dont think anybody else puts himself on a pedestal were all equals
2194375 we had some guys on there who were very quiet like mays and mccovey but when they spoke you listened we didnt have a cheerleader as such but when these two guys would speak and say you guys need to be quiet or you guys need to speak up thats exactly what we did they would lead by example they would lead by what they were supposed to do on the field
2194376 barr was a mean sob but he was great to me when mccovey came back in 77 even though willie mac was a quiet type of leader because he commanded so much respect you kind of followed the rules that willie mac set
2194377 first of all they had credibility they had been around for a few years bob brenly was just an outspoken person and the way he played krukow was one of the most competitive guys ive been around he worked hard between starts and on the mound with his stuff he battled as good as anybody i think they led more by example they also took it upon themselves to help the young guys when they came up robby thompson and will clark
2194378 it was rod beck and robb nen j t snow was solid in there dusty baker was unique because he was the manager but also very much a part of the clubhouse usually there was a kind of separation he was cool enough where he could play both roles woody kirk rueter did it in his way too
2194379 this is a different crew i think raj will surprise people and ive got a feeling sasha will have a strong meet if he can quit worrying about things and quit trying to be perfect and just compete theres no stopping him
2194380 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him

2194416 if we do one thing right we do another thing wrong

2194418 bobby made a great play and on the run i just couldnt find the bag
2194419 right now its not going our way and weve just got to keep fighting
2194420 you have to keep your head on straight in a situation like that
2194421 they said dont extend yourself dont do too much so i holed up at the hotel and ate as much as i could and sucked down fluids
2194422 if im going to tap into something it might as well be that one not the magglio massacre
2194423 it was only the scout team but it was nice to get out there
2194424 and i was like hey we were on the time magazine cover together
2194425 a few pictures snapped by other villagers here and there but nothing major
2194426 but he kind of walks around like most of the other athletes in here the press conference
2194427 daras on the cover of time and ryan lochte and phelps are on mens journal
2194428 and then it the attention kind of quickly fades out but the basketball guys are there on magazine covers and on tv year after year so its hard not to recognize them
2194429 you dont see swimmers putting themselves out there very much
2194430 they all came up and said youre not mad are you
2194431 it was more of a whirlwind coming in the first day of camp
2194432 i didnt have the offseason program but i felt like i did some things well
2194433 if you play feeling any pressure youre not going to be in a state of mind to be successful
2194434 if youre the third or fourth guy you dont get to play in the preseason
2194435 its certainly different even today not taking reps with the ones the first team in the last practice before a game is something different
2194436 if i got to pick i wouldnt pick going third
2194437 naturally you dont want to have a quarterback hand it off 12 plays in a row if we are trying to evaluate the quarterbacks
2194438 i signed more autographs in one day here than i had in my entire life
2194439 people dont care who you are they figure your autograph is worth having if youre playing in a major
2194440 if you get it going too sideways you can shoot a million
2194441 i just cant handle this this is no way to play golf
2194442 this course is diabolical its like trying to play scrabble without the vowels
2194443 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2194444 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2194445 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2194446 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2194447 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2194448 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2194449 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2194450 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2194451 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2194452 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2194453 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that

2194478 i am certain that the royal bank of scotland will overcome current challenges to become both highly profitable and highly successful once again
2194479 we are focused on doing what is right for our shareholders and to steer the business through a difficult time
2194480 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market writedowns we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured again
2194481 the idp population is mixed with some households previously displaced from mogadishu the capital and then there are those recently displaced out of beletweyne town by fighting
2194482 they have nothing to eat and fighting continues in parts of the region
2194483 children especially are facing malnutrition diarrhoea malaria whenever someone approaches the idp camps the children quickly gather around you thinking you might have some food for them
2194484 they have not eaten in days i dont know what to do we need food urgently
2194485 food supplies are urgently needed in somalia but deteriorating security has made delivery difficult by land and sea
2194486 canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking ville de qu bec with the role of escorting world food programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports
2194487 the countries are using american money to expand their military manipulate elections and promote terrorism
2194488 promotes a very negative stereotype and terrorism is our common enemy
2194489 all parties to this conflict have an obligation under international law to protect civilians and to refrain from indiscriminate attacks
2194490 yet it seems at every turn the death toll of ordinary somalis is growing far too many of them are women children or aid workers who have no part in this conflict
2194491 the humanitarian situation has deteriorated steadily in the 18 months that i have been emergency relief coordinator
2194492 and has now reached unprecedented desperate levels even in the context of somalia over the last 18 years

2194496 i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth no lie is of the truth
2194497 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it
2194498 no blood clot or brain tumor thank you very much
2194499 the resistance gives the assurance that it has become more powerful in equipment and numbers after the july war
2194500 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land
2194501 a group of troublemakers attacked me as soon as i started to speak and i couldnt continue my speech
2194502 respect the principles of a fair trial including limiting as much as possible states of provisional detention which lead to overcrowding in the prisons
2194503 this would include building modern prisons so as to limit overcrowding and to make sure that they conform to the necessary international standards
2194504 we have to reunite the people and win their trust in order to face future challenges
2194505 lebanese people need security they cannot afford more risks nor can they tolerate internal strife
2194506 the lebanese army is about classical warfare while the resistance is about guerrilla warfare both could be forms of defense but one form cannot replace the other
2194507 the right of lebanons people armed forces and resistance to liberate or reclaim the israeli occupied shebaa farms kafar shuba hills and the lebanese section of ghajar village and defend lebanon using all legal and possible means
2194508 the people army and resistance are all one thing we are all one entity in the face of any attack we dont have multi identities
2194509 putting the land under un custody will solve part of but not the entire problem therefore we should demand that the shebaa farms be put only under lebanese sovereignty
2194510 the palestinians were forced to leave their land as a result of an international resolution which legitimized the establishment of the state of israel at the expense of palestinian people
2194511 this means that all the international parties are all responsible for finding a solution to the problem of palestinian refugees it is unfair for a country like lebanon to tolerate such burden on its own
2194512 the united states should grant the palestinians access to their territory and allow them to live and work in the us which was at the top of the list of countries that are responsible for establishing the state of israel in 1948
2194513 although the draft statement stresses the role and authority of the state i believe that the lebanese people deserve a clearer ministerial statement that leaves no space for different interpretations
2194514 we will resort to all means to force the government accept our conditions the ll500 000 minimum wage will not be sufficient to feed the citizens
2194515 economic and financial policies that were practiced over the past 15 years
2194516 the lebanese government clearly understood the rules of the game when proposing the science centers establishment in lebanon
2194517 they welcomed scientists from all participating countries and no specific exclusion of israel was made
2194518 it will be on an ad hoc basis and probably depend mainly on regional developments
2194519 but the science center proposal is a very positive indication of the new governments willingness
2194520 projects were largely carried out through separate agreements between the european union and the arab states and the eu and israel
2194521 it is not possible to not discuss the conflict and still try and work together no real results can be expected from the union as long as the greater political conflict in the middle east is not resolved
2194522 when you apply for a project they require that all countries are present and they push you to work with israel
2194523 we applied for a project called med screen in which we want to screen arabic films in europe we included all countries except israel even turkey was included
2194524 they ask why we cannot work with israel and why we included turkey but not israel
2194525 we tell them that we are at war with israel which makes contact between lebanese and israelis illegal under lebanese law not with turkey
2194526 so that it became an exclusively arab project then it was ok
2194527 it is not only because it is illegal we simply dont want to work with israel they the eu always ask the same questions then they treat you as a backward person and tell you to make peace like artists are from another planet
2194528 the eu always invite israel together with arab participants they try to push us to work together
2194529 i will be very careful next time we apply for a project but we have no alternative there is no support from our government to make film
2194530 until we sign peace treaties there can be no cooperation with israel on joint projects unless they find a formula where we can work on regional projects but without any direct bilateral contact with israel that might be possible
2194531 there is a very important point in the concept of the union for mediterranean which is the variable geometry
2194532 that means in any regional or sub regional co operation where israel is included the project is divided in two parts and lebanon will be in the part where israel is not included lebanon is interested in the sub regional projects
2194533 we worked well and hope to reach an agreement within a month
2194534 raise the efficiency level of public administrations and government institutions and develop their human capacities it will adopt a democratic policy of merit and reward it on the basis of performance and not on the basis of loyalty and belonging
2194535 adopting reform policies to benefit from available human resources and adopting new characterization and classification for public offices
2194536 i only hope someone will step forward to right the commission system and put this mess in the federal courts or in the military justice system and start to restore the honor and integrity of our nations legal reputation
2194537 the us government has brought the case and shown that the process can be fair
2194538 i think the end result of the verdict today in this case is a bright light in a very dark and deeply flawed system
2194539 the bush administration should get the message and close the military commissions system
2194540 i think what happened today is a demonstration that the american military has a commitment to honor and justice and it sent a shot a loud shot across the bow of those who would seek to use it as an instrument for their political purposes
2194541 the next administration will inherit a real problem with this case
2194542 there will likely be a lot of pressure to release hamdan
2194543 current developments as well as relations between irans atomic energy organization and the iaea were discussed in a positive atmosphere
2194544 in entering into new commitments for public provided financial support for trade with iran notably the granting of export credits guarantees or insurance
2194545 carry out inspections at their airports and maritime ports on cargo going to and from iran
2194546 consensus among opposition forces and a pledge by hizbullah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah to free patriotic movement leader michel aoun that maronites would regain the post of head of general security
2194547 khoury enjoys the full support of maronite patriarch nasrallah butros sfeir but is opposed by a major group within march 14
2194548 kahwaji conversely faces reservations because he is close to one of the leaders of the march 14 forces
2194549 dumpling fest 2008 next summer if we practise enough during the year and if we find an enormous cauldron details coming up
2194550 heh heh thats clever geddit i amsterda what the hell kind of crepes are those ahaha
2194551 battered and bruised man after the week i have put him through
2194552 its too thick around the greens as well it takes the skill away from chipping you dont need it when the course is this long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked
2194553 theyre sucking the fun out of major championships when they set it up like that i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame because this is a fantastic course
2194554 you have thick rough at every major so he should be used to that
2194555 this is probably the hardest course ive ever played in my life
2194556 im comfortable playing in the big events where before i had a bit of a problem in them
2194557 i sort of pushed it too much so i always made a lot of mistakes
2194558 i hear a lot of people say oh i think hes vijays son or his brother i just say im the other singh
2194559 i will like politicians their family members and close allies to publicly declare their assets because there is the likelihood that they will hide behind somebody and loot the nation
2194560 law enforcement as far as corruption is concerned is the bane of ghanaians and i will go all out to save that situation
2194561 civil and public servants are likely not to engage in unhealthy practices for the fear of loosing all the better conditions they have toiled for
2194562 i have never been part of the npp administration because i was never called from the castle to take up an appointment but rather worked as a public servant
2194563 during such trips i even wondered if politicians ever existed in the country because the people were wallowing in abject poverty
2194564 it is pathetic to see vast portions of ghanaian lands full of weeds and yet the country is said to be an agricultural one i strongly believe that ghanaians dont eat weeds and that something must be done to the weeds
2194565 the current situation ghanaians find themselves in is not dignified enough and the trend must be changed for the better eight out of ten school going children do not get into the universities something must be done and that is why i am in the race
2194566 i have toured almost all the regions and met with the stakeholders of the cpp and strongly feel that something good will happen at the end of the congress
2194567 other political parties can underestimate the cpp at their own peril because the party is well poised to take up the countrys leadership mantle

2194569 how can i resist a gift of money when i am the only educated member of my family and everyone in the extended family looks to me to provide financial support my salary alone is not enough

2194576 is more dangerous than the northern occupied west bank jenin refugee camp
2194577 a new front in the global war on terror has opened up
2194578 both the us government and the american media have been blind to the evidence staring them in the face
2194579 indeed the policy of neglect is reflected in the gallery of portraits of former mayors that decorate the jerusalem municipality theodor kollek ehud olmert mordechai ish shalom gershon agron yitzhak kariv zalman shragai daniel auster
2194580 possibly the most blatant example of this neglect is the shuafat refugee camp which was included in jerusalems municipal boundaries
2194581 whoever thinks the basic pattern of life in jerusalem can continue with 270 000 arabs in east jerusalem must take into account that there will be bulldozers trucks and private cars and no way of preventing terror attacks of this kind
2194582 seven pakistani troops have been martyred and 30 militants have been killed in clashes at loisam and its surrounding areas since thursday
2194583 security forces and militants exchanged fire throughout the day friday as the operation continued against militants in bajaur region
2194584 such suspicious comments do not at all help build trust among states of the region they can only stoke conflicts and drag the region into a cycle of dangerous crises
2194585 soon another crisis will grip the persian gulf area and that is the legitimacy crisis of the monarchies and traditional systems in the region
2194586 the next crisis predicted to cover mainly the persian gulf is the crisis of legitimacy of the monarchies and traditional systems which considering current circumstances cannot go on living
2194587 those who believe that the present circumstances enable them to expand and exercise control at the expense of others interests are mistaken
2194588 are very disappointed by and deeply concerned at such irresponsible remarks and they expect an immediate clarification from iran of its deputy foreign ministers statement
2194589 as coalition forces approached a compound they were threatened by several armed militants
2194590 the force responded with small arms fire killing the militants and inadvertently killing four women and a child located with them
2194591 we are planning to conduct a full and thorough investigation
2194592 we want to see whether the provisions of the agreement are serious we will be satisfied if the agreement contains the withdrawal of us forces
2194593 if so we will complete the reorganization of the mehdi army which aims to transform it into a social organization
2194594 we will be forced to await the decision of withdrawal of american forces
2194595 he is considering the options that are available he will respond to the governments allegations and defend himself
2194596 we will prepare a case the president should be there in parliament and defend himself and at least say i am not a crook
2194597 we are going to oppose it it is a half baked effort and a sure recipe for disaster
2194598 can dismiss the government suspend it or leave the stage but that option is very remote he would do that only when he realizes that the real powers are not supporting him
2194599 i will support deputy prime minister and foreign minister tzipi livni in her candidacy to lead kadima and the next government
2194600 deeply concerned by the decision by the israeli authorities to approve the construction
2194601 the construction of settlements anywhere in the occupied palestinian territories including east jerusalem is illegal under international law
2194602 this decision serves to undermine the credibility of the ongoing peace process
2194603 settlement activities prejudge the outcome of final status negotiations and compromise the viability of a concerted two state solution

2194607 artful eurotrip 2007 as we definitely have had more than a fair share of gallery outings for instance we were sure to see the art of a czech artist by the name of jan zrzavy who dabbled in a number of paint and illustration styles
2194608 touch me and i will rip out your spleen with my bare hands welcome to prague sir
2194609 no this is for you good things come in small packages eh
2194610 he is the leader of this team he is an outstanding leader he talks the talk but then he does it on the field
2194611 i dont feel its an important topic all the veterans lead either youre a vocal leader or you lead by example or you do a little bit of both at some point in the season you need everybody to step up and pull his own weight
2194612 i think being a leader youve got to not be afraid to call people out not be afraid to ruffle some feathers
2194613 a good leader isnt somebody whom everybody likes but somebody everyone respects everybody does like rowand because hes got a good personality and he will talk to you but hes not a guy whos going to beat around the bush if he doesnt like something hes going to speak his mind
2194614 what makes him a leader is whatever he says whatever he puts out there he backs up
2194615 hes in his office doing his stuff on every club you need guys to take on that role because were the ones spending the majority of the time with each other its not the managers job to baby sit
2194616 its up to the older guys on the team to help the younger guys out to mentor to police to be the guys who are responsible for bringing everyone together for one common goal to win ballgames together as a unit
2194617 it was his clubhouse but he didnt want that role he wanted the title he wanted it to be his clubhouse but he didnt want to do the team building stuff so we kind of worked around that we didnt have one leader
2194618 id be lying to you if i didnt say at times that can be difficult
2194619 because when youre not getting the results you want its real easy to not be as exuberant or as vocal as you probably want to be
2194620 i wouldnt do or say anything that i wouldnt do to myself
2194621 im not better than anybody else in this clubhouse i dont think anybody else puts himself on a pedestal were all equals
2194622 we had some guys on there who were very quiet like mays and mccovey but when they spoke you listened we didnt have a cheerleader as such but when these two guys would speak and say you guys need to be quiet or you guys need to speak up thats exactly what we did they would lead by example they would lead by what they were supposed to do on the field
2194623 barr was a mean sob but he was great to me when mccovey came back in 77 even though willie mac was a quiet type of leader because he commanded so much respect you kind of followed the rules that willie mac set
2194624 first of all they had credibility they had been around for a few years bob brenly was just an outspoken person and the way he played krukow was one of the most competitive guys ive been around he worked hard between starts and on the mound with his stuff he battled as good as anybody i think they led more by example they also took it upon themselves to help the young guys when they came up robby thompson and will clark
2194625 it was rod beck and robb nen j t snow was solid in there dusty baker was unique because he was the manager but also very much a part of the clubhouse usually there was a kind of separation he was cool enough where he could play both roles woody kirk rueter did it in his way too

2194673 the city created the museum with grants subsidised by the nuclear facilities up there
2194674 the project has nothing to do with local residents like us
2194675 some people in the city administration are simply doing what they feel like doing
2194676 we are aware of the criticism that the city spends money for the sake of spending
2194677 but we believe that this is an investment in the future increasing peoples awareness of arts and culture
2194678 the quality is far more superb than we had expected
2194679 i like visiting art museums i just went to tokyo the other day to cruise the museums

2194683 im sure the artwork is great and making the main street a wonderful place
2194684 but old folks here are wondering why the city spends so much money on such things

2194736 that returnees of akwa ibom state origin should continue to wallow in such inhuman conditions is totally unacceptable to any government as a responsive administration we are duty bound to take concrete and genuine steps without prejudice to the decision of the icj towards ensuring that our people who have been displaced in the aftermath of this judgment are resettled and reintegrated

2194787 but in a case eerily similar to haneefs didnt our investigating agencies almost put an innocent man on death row the special pota court trying the case in its early stages convicted a delhi based college teacher along with the other accused and sentenced him to death the entire case against professor s a r geelani was based on the fact that he had some telephonic contact with the prime accused in the days before the attack it was left to the supreme court to conclusively throw out the case against the professor and acquit him of all charges but even today intelligence officials and investigating officers insist that their case against him was foolproof and they had been let down by the courts i dont remember any public outrage defining the national response to the professor geelani case if anything most people seemed willing to believe the police and were impatient and dismissive of the do gooder human rights activists campaigning for his release

2194972 what are you doing with your copy of the digital file
2194973 google for instance is digitizing some great libraries but their contracts which were actually secret contracts with libraries which is bizarre but anyway they were secret until they got sued out of them by some governments are under such restrictions that theyre pretty useless the copies that go back to the libraries pretty much google is trying to set themselves up as the only place to get to these materials the only library the only access the idea of having only one company control the library of human knowledge is a nightmare i mean this is 1984 a book about how bad the world would be if this really came about if a few governments control and corporations control on information goes too far
2194974 im using google notebook as my online notebook im finding it particularly useful right now in conjunction with google groups since i receive posts in digest form and theres no way to single out a single post to refer to later i simply copy paste the post into the appropriate section of my notebook things i want to look into further go into my check it out section im telling ya if you havent opened your google notebook yet youre missing out the best part is that i can access it from any computer anywhere at any time i no longer have to worry about schlepping my hard copies around or walking around w a permanent slouch in the left shoulder from all the weight

2195005 it was normal practice for the namibian film commission to have checked on how the money allocated for the project was spent during the initial phase of production in which seven episodes had been completed it was a case of better now than later to ensure proper control and accountability on the publics tax money
2195006 it took some time before our accountant could obtain all the necessary documentation from prime media for a considered opinion regarding the proper spending of the money i know nothing about any rumors nor do i have any evidence to that effect that the company was using the productions funding to upgrade its business enterprise

2195016 for an individual who has an extraordinary strength in visual spatial or right brained functioning to be called
2195017 there seems to be a confusion in assuming a right brained dominance in individuals who simply lack normal education they confuse the lack of left hemisphere development with a superior right hemisphere
2195018 unquestionably neuropathologic and imaging studies showing lesions and dysfunction lateralized to the right side support the desirability of further search for evidences of early abnormal lateral brain organization in the context of adhd
2195019 there is an important role for the speech language pathologist and other personnel in working with adhd based on the systems theory approach the intrinsic nature of adhd is no longer viable
2195020 the ability to maintain an appropriate problem solving set for attainment of future goals

2195043 our services pertain not only to communication disorders but also to societal wellness we need to frame our arguments on the potential future impact of unremediated speech language and literacy disorders particularly their impact on the major problems of society including youth crime and violence
2195044 there is strong evidence of the relationship between violent behavior and communication disorders lets consider social control not just gun control it makes sense for slps to take a leadership role in the prevention of school violence

2195048 as a result of tactics similar to those employed in other fascist countries the church in spain supported franco
2195049 practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the anarchists every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle and with the initials of the revolutionary parties almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt

2195053 leading atheists like christopher hitchens richard dawkins and sam harris are convinced they have refuted the traditional idea that the chains of causation in the universe imply the existence of a creator
2195054 harris triumphantly notes that to say the universe must have been created by god poses an immediate problem of an infinite regress
2195055 the theist says that god when setting up the universe tuned the fundamental constants of the universe so that each one lay in its goldilocks zone for the production of life it is as though god had six knobs that he could twiddle and he carefully turned each knob to its goldilocks value as ever the theists answer is deeply unsatisfying because it leaves the existence of god unexplained a god capable of calculating the goldilocks values for the six numbers would have to be at least as improbable as the finely tuned combination of numbers itself and thats very improbable indeed
2195056 the academy was everything i hoped for and more i cant wait to plan out ways to use the tools we learned about to share my experiences with my colleagues and to re connect with the other academy participants
2195057 the focus on innovation in education and not just about the tools was right on target
2195058 i appreciate the opportunity to be connected to a group of educators that are passionate about preparing students for the 21st century i feel inspired and able to meet the challenges that lie ahead
2195059 until now i had never attended a conference where i was so engaged and loving every minute of it

2195062 this plan appears to have been assembled under the watchful eye of u s government agencies dozens of state agencies and scores of private non governmental organizations working behind the scenes to create this nafta super highway despite the lack of comment by president bush the american public is largely asleep to this key piece of the coming north american union that government planners in the new trilateral region of the united states canada and mexico are about to drive into reality
2195063 these deals are about provoking domestic reform in the partner countries which will make it easier for them to pursue further liberalization at the multilateral level if they introduce more market oriented reforms in their domestic policy

2195071 they want to know where you have left the carcass of the leopard and if you have taken away the brains
2195072 i daresay you know if not youll soon come to find out that all the nigger tribes in africa are sunk in gross and cruel superstitions they have more fetishes and greegrees and amulets and wooden gods and charms than they know what to do with and have surrounded themselves with spiritual mysteries that neither themselves nor anybody else can understand among other things they attach a very high value to the brains of the leopard because they imagine that he who possesses them will be rendered extraordinarily bold and successful in hunting these fellows are in hopes that being ignorant of the value of leopard brains you have left them in the carcass and are burning with anxiety to be off after them
2195073 they are heartily welcome to the brains and the carcass lies not more than four hours march from this spot i should think is it not so jack
2195074 and theyre kindly fellows too jovial and good humoured except when under the influence of their abominable superstitions then they become incarnate fiends and commit deeds of cruelty that make ones blood run cold to think of

2195090 we are convinced that we are the right partners for transalta as management would have enhanced flexibility to execute longer term strategies for growth
2195091 the unlisted infrastructure market has grown from being a niche sector of the private equity industry into being what many now regard as a separate asset class
2195092 many investors now treat the sector completely independently to other private equity and unlisted fund investments with a significant 47 of active investors in the asset class establishing a separate allocation for infrastructure while 43 include infrastructure funds in their private equity portfolio and 10 include it in their real assets portfolio
2195093 there have been concerns from some commentators that fund raising for the unlisted infrastructure market has left the industry awash with surplus capital and that current levels of fund raising are unsustainable in the long term
2195094 however with significant new markets opening up in america plus other emerging markets such as india we expect to see more opportunities available to fund managers than ever before with uncertainties continuing to surround financial markets worldwide many investors are turning to infrastructure in order to add stability and security to their portfolios
2195095 infrastructure is a multi trillion dollar global marketplace with enormous need for private investment kkr recognizes the important role infrastructure investing plays in the growth of both developed and developing economies this new initiative is a logical extension of our business building on the significant expertise we have established by investing in large complex and regulated businesses and our record of driving operational improvements in a wide range of industries

2195107 again as with goldilocks the anthropic alternative to the design hypothesis is statistical scientists invoke the magic of large numbers it has been estimated that there are between 1 billion and 30 billion planets in our galaxy and about 100 billion galaxies in the universe knocking a few noughts off for reasons of ordinary prudence a billion billion is a conservative estimate of the number of available planets in the universe
2195108 now suppose the origin of life the spontaneous arising of something equivalent to dna really was a quite staggeringly improbable event suppose it was so improbable as to occur on only one in one billion planets a grant giving body would laugh at any chemist who admitted that the chance of his proposed research succeeding was only one in a hundred but here we are talking about odds of one in a billion and yet even with such absurdly long odds life will still have arisen on a billion planets of which earth of course is one

2195143 believes that it is critically important for the united states to rebuild its national transportation infrastructure its highways bridges roads ports air and train systems to strengthen user safety bolster our long term competitiveness and ensure our economy continues to grow
2195144 voracious critic of how congress loads up infrastructure spending bills with pet projects for members and special interests
2195145 the status quo increasingly looks like a precarious option relying on existing networks and systems will only hamstring future growth and compromise sustainability this country simply cannot afford to keep treating infrastructure as an afterthought
2195146 unfortunately the infrastructure debate in this country only moves forward when catastrophic examples occur of the state of our bridges roads airports and water systems
2195147 if we are going to address this issue and be in a position to challenge rampant economies such as china over the next few decades we have to take a much more considered and holistic approach and not wait for another structure to collapse we need to create a mindset to have the will to build
2195148 it the bill targets specifically large capacity building projects that are not adequately served by current financing mechanisms the proposed infrastructure bank act also will increase the ability of the private sector to play a central role in infrastructure provision
2195149 the legislation we are introducing establishes a new system through which the federal government can finance infrastructure projects by leveraging private and public capital to fund large projects that are vital to our country this legislation provides a new model for prioritizing the building and maintenance of our national infrastructure
2195150 in the fredericks case it was held that the jurisdiction of the high court to determine disputes arising from alleged infringements of constitutional rights by the state acting in its capacity as an employer was not ousted by section 157 1 of the labour relations act lra simply because the dispute was one falling within the overall sphere of employment relations
2195151 in the chirwa case it was held that in instances of conduct by an organ of state in its capacity as an employer the primary purposes of section 157 2 was not to confer jurisdiction on high courts to deal with employment disputes but to empower the labour court to adjudicate disputes founded on the provisions of the bill of rights that arise from employment relations
2195152 the facts are different i am called upon to decide the legal validity of the decision to suspend mr mpofu not to pronounce on the merits of the fairness of the decision
2195153 in other words i must determine whether the decision taken by the nonexecutive directors is in law a decision of the sabc board
2195154 there is no specific provision in the labour relations act for dealing with that kind of issue i can think of no policy consideration that such an issue belongs in the labour court the issue involves company law more than labour law
2195155 it does not extend because of mr mpofus right to challenge the fairness of the decision to suspend him before the commission for conciliation mediation and arbitration to any of his complaints concerning the fairness thereof
2195156 it would follow that his complaints of unfair procedure malice ulterior motives and the like might well be beyond the jurisdiction of this court i am not called upon to decide this question and i refrain from doing so

2195190 this deal is just another example of abengoas ability to continue financing operations in a difficult environment the confidence that the financial institutions place in the combination of abengoa solars technology and operational leadership and abengoas construction capabilities is one of the keys to the success of this deal

2195228 the theme of the first game is discovery the theme of the second game is revenge and the third game enlightenment

2195234 i think the most obvious reason that square enix made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us
2195235 i think its easy to assume that something is going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360

2195242 iraq islamic state is blessing the actions that you are conducting through the blessed instructions from emir abu dawod as the state suffers from the crusade by apostates and unbelievers who sold their religion for dinars we swear to god that this will not end peacefully for them and they will get nothing from us but beheadings
2195243 i miss my brothers sisters and mother sitting together for lunch
2195244 but even if you return to the same setting it is impossible to return to the way it was nothing will bring us together like eternal life
2195245 im too frightened to eat if you want me to show you im not al qaida ill eat all of these dishes
2195246 i have a secret source that says she is involved with al qaida

2195257 a clean uncluttered desk is a sign of a sick mind
2195258 forget about colour and brand name the first thing to look for is a great fit and ensure that the pair you choose makes your legs look long
2195259 the back in these jeans rides too low and for this body type isnt flattering
2195260 instead open the hemline and shred it that again adds length
2195261 denim is a thicker fabric so it works especially well for really thin people
2195262 the style i find works best on me is the low waist boot cut
2195263 dont wear extra tight stretch jeans if youre very thin youll end up looking gawky
2195264 please do not squeeze yourself into a pair of jeans
2195265 you can suck your stomach and make them fit while trying them out but how long will you be able to do that in daily life
2195266 long jeans that cover your shoes entirely make you look like you are walking on stilts
2195267 jeans with stretch that hold the body really nicely are in
2195268 the narrow straight fit is in and the boot cut never goes out of style
2195269 the boot cut is always very flattering and thus remains in jeans with ripped frayed edges are also in now as are jeans with the bottom turned over
2195270 if you like the style make sure you pair it with a plain top

2195273 the so called madhesi ethnic group which by some estimates represents as much as a third of nepals population of 29 million has been granted citizenship rights for the first time in the 50 year history of independent nepal
2195274 it is difficult to overstate how radically and quickly the ground is shifting in nepal since king gyanendra gave up his absolute rule in april and returned the government to an elected parliament that was dismissed four years ago
2195275 by putting the planned elections in jeopardy the troubles threaten to unravel a delicate peace deal intended to end more than a decade of maoist conflict that has claimed an estimated 13 000 lives
2195276 shes someone id love to follow in the footsteps of because i love the way she balanced her record and it really showed different sides to her and hopefully ill be able to do that jordins just such an amazing emotional mature vocalist performer and artist
2195277 since there isnt a lot of time put into this and not really a lot of chance to have a lot of say in it like trying to write with different people hopefully this album will be kind of like an introduction to whats up ahead if this album works ill be able to work on more stuff in the future that has more input from me
2195278 a lot of people were wondering if i was able to pull off pop and i think this song shows people that i can
2195279 hopefully it doesnt limit me to anything cause id love to show my variety like jordin did
2195280 im gonna be very particular in what i choose because i do believe this is a big chance and i dont want to waste it
2195281 it is not necessary to use an anti dandruff shampoo if the dandruff is not excessive use a shampoo that is suitable for your hair regularly and keep your hair squeaky clean that is good enough to drive dandruff away
2195282 use an anti dandruff shampoo only if the dandruff is excessive continue the use for two months after the dandruff is gone shampoos with lemon and olive oil extract are particularly good for dandruff prone hair
2195283 i choose tee shirts that fit well and are comfortable though i go in for conventional shades like white black orange and blue i prefer interesting captions ranging from sweet to coy to outright loud
2195284 one of my favourite slogan is i like it when my i love to hear people fill in the blanks you wont believe what they come up with
2195285 never fool yourself with the idea that a baggy tee shirt is going hide your flab or make you look thinner on the contrary you end up looking 10 times bigger
2195286 if you like the grunge look go for tee shirts with skull prints and hobo or mexican style graphics
2195287 chiffon or crochet at the end of the full sleeved tee shirt gives it a more formal feel
2195288 you could also consider embellishments like swarovski crystals stones or diamond studs on sporty tees like the racer back
2195289 if you are wearing a gypsy skirt team it with semi fit tees singlets baggy flowing tops or tees with such skirts make you look bigger
2195290 you can use patches of cloth like crochet or chiffon in different colours cut them into flower shapes and attach them to your tee in form of a brooch
2195291 just a few inches away from the middle cut a slit of five inches towards the bottom of your tee shirt tie the split cloth into a knot it looks very cute
2195292 folded sleeves look tacky its better to cut them off asymmetrical sleeves are fine they add to the grunge look

2195303 standley a former prosecutor said the case of james lee cross was unique
2195304 he was trying to get a hold of her because she has a problem
2195305 i thought this would help him realize that he only has control over himself

2195315 lets remove from power the key enablers of the tyrannical and lawless fisa compromise we can end the patriot act and so much more
2195316 that day illustrates how far we have fallen in this country in less than 35 years
2195317 why is big oil trying to buy our seat in congress and why is davis accepting their cash
2195318 democrats are already highlighting the race as an example of how they believe the politics of energy can play in their favor
2195319 roe focused his campaign on charges that davis was in the pocket of
2195320 roe ran a grassroots campaign that challenged the status quo and put people before politics
2195321 phil roe has a history of community service within the 1st district and is currently the mayor of johnson city
2195322 is also an army veteran and an obstetrician by profession
2195323 the more democratic slant on big oil where you have the rhetoric being about greed that wasnt really our slant on it
2195324 it really wasnt their rhetoric it was probably a lot more conservative in nature in terms of anti earmarks anti influence clean up government

2195332 wooo i love champagne lemme get rid of this gum woo
2195333 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2195334 this happend today russian peace keepers who stan at georgia and abkhazian conflict zone have moved into zugdidi region fully controlled by georgian jurisdiction and they arrested georgian policeman while they where tring to ask them what was going on also they shoot in sky when president of georgia mikhail saakashvili arrived at that place

2195382 der bundestrainer hat immer deutlich gemacht dass ausschlie lich leistungskriterien bei der auswahl eine rolle spielen deswegen bestand f r mich kein anlass mich ffentlich ins gespr ch zu bringen ich vertraue voll und ganz joachim l w und werde alles tun um ihn durch meine leistungen auf dem platz davon zu berzeugen dass ich ihm bei der besetzung der torwart position helfen kann

2195384 das ist toll darauf habe ich die ganze zeit hingearbeitet es ist f r die mannschaft und f r mich wie ein neuanfang wir wollen wieder auf ganz hohem niveau fu ball spielen
2195385 die reha war eine schwierige zeit sie war oft eint nig und langweilig ich konnte mich nicht wie gewohnt bewegen konnte nur zuschauen nie eingreifen ich habe das gef hl vermisst gebraucht zu werden ich denke dass dich jede verletzung ver ndert reifer macht ich habe meinen k rper noch besser kennengelernt sehe sachen aus einem anderen blickwinkel will auch st rken aus dieser zeit ziehen ich bin ruhiger und gelassener geworden
2195386 diese situationen sind meiner meinung nicht ganz vergleichbar ich habe das damals sehr wohl zur kenntnis genommen so ist das im fu ball aber ich schaue jetzt nur nach vorne
2195387 das war der negative h hepunkt der ganzen zeit ich hatte mich gefreut darauf hingearbeitet und dann wird dir von heute auf morgen diese chance genommen da ist erst mal drei tage nichts gelaufen ich war nur niedergeschlagen aber auch das ist fu ball es macht dich reifer und st rker
2195388 das ist richtig ich war in einer praxis f r ganzk rper training um meinen k rper noch geschmeidiger und gelenkiger zu machen jeder berufsfu baller sollte in seinen k rper investieren ich will ja noch zehn jahre auf hohem niveau spielen durch die vorbereitung bin ich beschwerdefrei gekommen ich bin topfit habe keinerlei probleme au er ab und zu mal muskelkater nach den trainingseinheiten lacht rot weiss essen kann kommen

2195693 wow thats stupid implausible obviously false obviously heretical if its a christian thing
2195694 how would i respond to that if i an orthodox person were a calvinist
2195695 for the purposes of this post i will assume my own ignorance i admit that i do not fully understand the orthodox teaching on church infallibility and so i invite my orthodox brothers to help me by interacting with my musings and perhaps answering my questions
2195696 1 the council of nicea was called by the emperor the secular power not the church this seems odd to me in fact it seems entirely likely that had not constantine wished to keep his empire whole and secure we might have seen fracturing in the church not unlike modern protestant denominationalism today the bishops of christendom were quite content to argue amongst themselves and there doesnt seem any reason to think that such a council would ever have been called had constantine not stepped in moreover constantine made it clear that the councils decisions would be enforced again by secular power this also seems odd if there was a clear understanding of church infallibility from the days of the apostles and indeed if the bishops at nicea were also well aware of it would such enforcement be necessary i suppose it could have been merely precautionary in any event the fact that the whole affair was conducted from start to finish in such a stately secular manner casts some doubt on what i take to be the orthodox understanding of the nature of church infallibility
2195697 2 the wording of the nicean creed was such that many of the bishops perhaps more than half were able to sign it while still remaining fully arian in their thinking they affirmed the words but not their orthodox spirit and in a short time they were again preaching their arianism this leads to another important question if the majority of the bishops at the ecumenical council didnt even truly agree with what was later to become the orthodox position of the church and supposedly the council where is infallibility located again i am mostly speaking from ignorance here and im open to correction but my understanding of the orthodox position is that infallibility resides in ecumenical consensus and yet it seems that the true consensus of nicea at least at the time favored arianism and it seems very strange that many of the bishops present at an ecumenical council and responsible for its decision would be so blatantly and sinfully duplicitous in their actions god can use sinful men to be sure but when it comes to the infallible descisions of the church i assume the presumption is that he is using holy men
2195698 3 many times i have heard from an orthodox brother that such and such was the
2195699 in response to your introduction im not sure how helpful your suggestion is or how well it actually applies here after all the protestant tradition which holds that the catholic and orthodox traditions are incorrect is now 500 years old and has also been held by many intelligent and pure hearted people does orthodoxy deserve the benefit of the doubt simply because it is older thats not what i thought you were saying i thought you were saying that orthodoxy deserves the benefit of the doubt because it has been around for a very long time and has been held to by many smart and pure hearted people but then why give orthodoxy the benefit of the doubt over protestantism
2195700 oh in regards to your final point 3c can you point me to any specific sources that discuss athanasius defenses of the nicene creed
2195701 we are a national governing body and we are running on a voluntary basis out of our homes we have tried everything but people in government keep passing the buck
2195702 meanwhile they are pouring millions into the london olympics we are taxpayers too and given the choice we would rather not have london 2012
2195703 it would be embarrassing if the deaf olympic games which britain helped to found had no british team
2195704 it would cause so much damage to the deaf community and our profile worldwide we may have to pull out of taipei if there is no financial support from the government within the next few months
2195705 i feel we are marginalized it may not be deliberate because you could walk past me and not know im deaf its more about awareness
2195706 but the mentality goes to the highest level of government
2195707 we informed them as far back as 2006 so we have been very clear about this for some time as the agency charged with delivering medal success at the games we have taken the decision to prioritize our investment on olympic and paralympic sports and athletes this has led to some organizations previously funded no longer being so it does not lessen their relevance or appropriateness but in a world of finite resources the decision is the right one
2195708 the cost of winning a medal at the deaflympics was 1 400 a stark contrast to the 1 6 million per medal at the athens games in 2004
2195709 we are not asking for a massive amount it really is peanuts compared to the millions being spent on the olympics that is what is so frustrating because it will have a massive impact on deaf athletes

2195770 this inquiry is into the cause of the deaths of three members of one family living at skegness which all occurred on sunday afternoon last at a field at the rear of lincoln road on the brickpits there when the ice gave way and the three were drowned
2195771 we all rushed out my wife following on and when i got there i saw my sons head above the water margaret and beryl his sisters both rushed on to ice and as they got towards him i saw the ice give way and they went in the water
2195772 they dashed on without hesitating and never stopped in any way mr collinson a lodger was with me and he rushed forward with my wife
2195773 l was also in the water but almost collapsed at what was happening and was helped out i shouted for help the ice was thicker at the sides than further in
2195774 i saw beryl get hold of the boy and i think that he must have dragged her down with him by that time other people had arrived
2195775 we did not know that they had gone off to the pond
2195776 we were all trying our best to get them out we tried artificial respiration on the mother and margaret was still alive
2195777 i threw the clothes line to the youngest girl and it landed across her shoulder and she got hold of it it was a lucky shot and i was able to pull her in with the assistance of hayes and hilliard we got mrs key out with the prop and we were all trying to get them out as quickly as we could

2195861 you dont shift your love and attention away from one to another right in fact instead of 50 50 it should be 200 100 for the baby and 100 for the wife right
2195862 i dont want to put numbers on love because our love for each other shouldnt change once we have a baby i would still love you the same way i do now
2195863 is really just a commentary on how complicated it is for a man to balance career family and yes an unending cavalcade of grown up urges
2195864 men are so scared and ashamed of the feelings they have sometimes the worst thing a man can admit is im not 100 percent fulfilled by my family but it doesnt mean he doesnt love his family i love my family but i still want to work i still want challenges it took me a while to fall in love with the responsibility of family life and it was a deep thing when i did but i also want to run back to the cave sometimes forever

2195889 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2195890 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2195903 intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
2195904 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken

2195918 todays report provides strong evidence that labour markets are starting to succumb to weakening gdp growth

2195920 maybe now the labour market is better reflecting what weve been seeing on the expenditure side

2195922 in the current deregulated telecommunications market our government has no intention of interfering with the day to day business decisions of private companies or with the choices available to consumers
2195923 given these undertakings by bell mobility and telus i would encourage consumers dissatisfied with existing plans to seek alternatives
2195924 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2195925 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged

2195933 the movement downward in oil over the last couple of weeks i view as helpful in the whole equation
2195934 is aggressively managing the costs of all controllable parts of its operation and continues in its efforts to mitigate the significant increase in its fuel expense
2195935 are prices going to fall 20 per cent the way they did in the u s probably not
2195936 but its pretty clear that things are weakening and theyre going to continue weakening for some time
2195937 we never had that kind of credit excess in canada
2195938 i am worried right across the country that things are tightening up and that a year from now we are going to see a drop off
2195939 its quiet on the buyers side listings are up sales are down
2195940 my clients are still getting mortgages but its getting a lot tougher to qualify youre looking at a lot more documentation longer application times and higher down payments
2195941 weve gone back 20 years as far as documentation is required it seems like the old days
2195942 however for people who have a good credit score and are not in a declining area money is still available to them
2195943 id caution people to be very careful do your homework see the properties have an expert read over your mortgage documents if you want to rent make sure its allowed
2195944 she is fit with abs that would make a photoshop editor cry at their perfection
2195945 it makes me feel even more inadequate to know that torres is a 41 year old mother of a two year old where id like to know are her stretch marks and postpregnancy pooch
2195946 ms torres has got a great abdominal its a good body a great body
2195947 it took a lot of work i dont want people getting false ideals
2195948 i have some of the fittest elderly women i have seen in my life
2195949 the no 1 thing i get more than anything is people say they want to look toned
2195950 a lot of people think with a toned body like madonnas it looks sexy and it looks healthy too
2195951 the image of that body translates into beliefs about a persons character so if you have the willpower to work out six days a week then you must be an incredibly strong character
2195952 i think the ripped female figure is a little more on the extreme
2195953 for some people it would take an obscene amount of work to get them near to that shape
2195954 its average athletes who are the most likely to curtail their sleep to train
2195955 theyre getting up at 4 a m to run for an hour so they can get to work by 7 a m
2195956 in terms of overall training benefit its better to get your sleep because the platform of good training is recovery
2195957 i know it sounds ridiculous to get 10 hours of sleep a night

2195966 canada has been considered a bastion of economic stability unlike the u s the u k europe japan which are already in recession or heading that way canada until recently has held up quite well but this jobs report is a sign that its our turn now
2195967 were starting to see surprises in canadian economic indicators coming in on the downside
2195968 but the key is the employment report its all about the consumer and consumer confidence is driven by the employment outlook and by income of course there are signs now that what had been a very solid support for canadian consumers is fraying around the edges
2195969 theres a very strong correlation between the u s dollar and oil
2195970 what were seeing here is not a commodity story it is a big u s dollar recovery story
2195971 rather the next move out of the fed is expected to be a rate hike it may not come for some period of time but there is a very strong view in the marketplace that the next move out of the fed is going to be a rate hike
2195972 i think that we have now got a wedge driven between the north american dollar couplet
2195973 hes a kid who doesnt know very much if at all about the religion
2195974 i think if you ask the real terrorists in the world theyd feel insulted that he was nothing more than a mickey mouse kid who was venting some of his frustrations and talking
2195975 at that time itself i wouldve alerted police and he wouldve been saved
2195976 i think he was searching for god he was confused i guess
2195977 my parents dont understand its his decision i just wanted him to be careful
2195978 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the marketplace
2195979 the biggest driving factor now to the downside is the fact that the u s economy has a lot of company right now in terms of weakening economic growth
2195980 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 u s for labour day

2195985 whenever brian went out of town hed board macy at the training school
2195986 the trainers were shocked when brians assistant came in one day and said brian was being forced to give macy up for adoption because megan didnt get along with her
2195987 right after brian gave macy up for adoption megan adopted two tiny dogs

2196010 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2196011 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2196012 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2196013 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2196014 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2196015 we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving

2196017 i put my country first then and will continue to put country first
2196018 while theres no doubt senator mccain has served his country with honor the agenda hes supported over the last eight years has not served the nation as well
2196019 i dont think its about john mccain its about making obama different foreign other
2196020 these people are running a bad version of the last campaign 2008 is not 2004
2196021 i said at that time i would much rather lose a political campaign than lose a war senator obama took a different path
2196022 when we didnt work as a team they broke us down we were a team and we had leaders
2196023 half a world away another kind of love of country john mccain shot down bayoneted tortured
2196024 a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve
2196025 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2196026 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2196027 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2196028 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2196029 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2196030 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2196031 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2196032 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2196033 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2196034 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2196035 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2196036 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee
2196037 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2196038 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2196039 while the immediate response to acute stress can be a temporary loss

2196052 natalie was a great player during her time at the university of minnesota and we know that she will add great value to our program she brings a wealth of experience at the international and olympic level that will benefit our student athletes
2196053 there were people deceased from the front of the bus to the back of the bus
2196054 i feel so sorry because shes dead she was just a very good person
2196055 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2196056 i myself cried this morning when i heard the news
2196057 not to us but to your name be the glory
2196058 maybe age has something to do with it younger writers like me or ucu agustin tend to be more relaxed even though we write serious stuff
2196059 i grew up in solo and older writers there believe in finding inspiration from within but i prefer to hang out with all sorts of people
2196060 high literature works are beautiful so i guess the writers need to dig deep into themselves to find ways to express that beauty
2196061 i write to get my problems out of my head i mold anything that is clamoring inside it into sentences its a good form of therapy
2196062 believe it or not three of my novels tell love stories in a musical setting band groups the other one is about a girl who falls in love with a badminton player
2196063 tabula rasa in many places deals with romance in general relationships between males and females between a young person and an older person and between lesbians
2196064 yeah my novels have some sexual content in a talk show in depok one man who claimed to be a teacher said my works were a threat to the morality of the nations youth so i told him that was not the message
2196065 besides people should no longer turn away from this kind of topic especially not young people
2196066 i have many dreams but i would like to help people with idealism but are afraid that they cannot sell i have a musician friend who used to convey political messages in his lyrics until one day he decided to give up and started writing mellow songs its sad really
2196067 so im hoping to work in an advertising agency one day
2196068 seeing your books brought to life on the big screen does sound exciting but what would really be an achievement is to have them translated and distributed overseas
2196069 but actually i just want to write and write and write
2196070 the first draft was written when i was in junior high but none of my friends wanted to read it i finally found someone who said she would take a look but days later i found the draft lying on a cafeteria table smeared with ketchup and soup
2196071 we print 7 000 copies per title distribute them and 3 000 copies ought to sell in a few months a teenlit work may have a very simple storyline but if teenagers like it they wont stop talking about it when the demand continues to rise the book can be reprinted any number of times
2196072 on one hand it saddens me that these commercial novels get a larger appreciation than works of literature do
2196073 on the other hand i am also happy that so many young writers today are not afraid to express their ideas
2196074 it is more about proving that i can write in that genre
2196075 if i were to write popular fiction however i would make sure it wasnt full of clich s some indonesian pop novels are blander than others
2196076 literary writers think that writing pop fiction means selling out because many pop novelists here do just that producing trashy books
2196077 my book is about teen life im a teenager and most of the people who read my book are teenagers so what i wrote must be a teenlit
2196078 but unlike most teenlit works i chose to reveal the dark side of teenage life i want people to understand that teenagers have that side too and to be able to care rather than blaming them for everything they do wrong
2196079 to delve into it know what it is trying to say and absorb it you may read some high literature and have no idea what it says its pointless you can also come across novels that are so commercial it serves no purpose but to be just that
2196080 literary taste is very subjective and attempts to rate popular fiction tend to create endless discussion
2196081 some consider that these works by teenagers are responsible for the bastardization of the indonesian language with which i have to agree but i am also convinced that its part of the growing up process for young writers
2196082 only time will tell as they grow older their command of the language will mature
2196083 young readers definitely prefer to read the work of people of a similar age
2196084 its good that young people have begun writing as a means of expression because one of the weaknesses of our culture is that people tend not to be able to articulate their opinions writing is a great way of exercising that ability
2196085 young writers today dont have vision like chairil did they do not think politically and socially for a greater cause they only write about their teenage world
2196086 i write to get my problems out of my head i mold anything that is clamoring inside it into sentences its a good form of therapy
2196087 i grew up in solo and older writers there believe in finding inspiration from within but i prefer to go out hang out with all sorts of people

2196103 i had a chat with eddie jones at the end of last season and he asked me my thoughts on the captaincy and i told him he needed to make what he felt was the best decision for the team
2196104 and you really couldnt have asked for two better people to take on the role steve has played at the top of the game for many years and is the current england captain hell be away for periods during the season so hes got andy backing him up and his leadership qualities are obvious for all to see

2196125 is conducting its own investigation of the alleged break in and bugging of the democratic national committee headquarters
2196126 the committee for the re election of the president is worried that a hearing on a suit involved in the break in and bugging attempt could cause incalculable damage to president nixons campaign the committee asked u s district court to postpone suit against them until after the november 7 election to hear the suit before the election the committee said could deter campaign workers and contributions force disclosure of confidential information and provide the democrats with a reason to hold a news conference

2196128 this study of the southwest museum campus was prepared at the request of the autry national center pursuant to the autry museums merger with the southwest museum it attempts to answer three questions what improvements are necessary for the southwest museum campus and its historically significant structures to continue in use as a museum what is the anticipated cost of these improvements how will these enhancements to the institution affect its economic viability
2196129 as a rule museums do not earn enough to pay their bills the income accounting for 30 to 50 of operating expenses
2196130 this report has analyzed what would be required to prepare the southwest for continued museum use with its envelope and infrastructure meeting museum standards
2196131 if you stuck an intercept up near one of those camps you wouldnt believe the amount of outgoing calls after every meeting saying tomorrow were going to cut the fence
2196132 easily one in four of the people there are taking the corporate shilling
2196133 mi5 and mi6 in particular have always guided ex employees into security companies
2196134 its always useful to them to have friends they can tap for info or recruit for a job that requires plausible deniability the big change in recent years has been the huge growth in these companies where before it was a handful of private detective agencies now there are hundreds of multinational security organisations which operate with less regulation than the spooks themselves
2196135 the intelligence gathering methodology and analytical skills traditionally honed by cia operatives directly to the boardroom with a service like this ceos and their security personnel will be able to respond to threats quickly and confidently whether its determining which city is safest to open a new plant in or working to keep employees out of harms way after a terrorist attack
2196136 it is hard to work well for an oil company without knowing who all the key decision makers in a government are and having the right contacts to reach them
2196137 we have an intelligence section where we employ some investigative journalists people from the finance sector from equity banks and some from security backgrounds
2196138 it is an important part of image protection for our clients as well
2196139 so we need to be able to understand and prepare our own propaganda to counter such attacks this is work we do to protect our clients
2196140 is that youll never know hes around and hell never get caught
2196141 the fact you cant see them it means nothing at all
2196142 identify and counteract any rival effort to weaken the clients reputation
2196143 even in the middle of the night so that users are unaware
2196144 i was a single mother for all my life i work hard for her

2196154 i think of the olympics as an opportunity for people to make a symbolic act of defiance

2196160 las agrupaciones tienen un sistema defectuoso de elecci n en donde priman criterios que no son los mejores entre ellos la contribuci n econ mica del postulante esto es porque los grupos pol ticos no tienen financiamiento del estado como ocurre en el 90 de los pa ses del mundo

2196162 the barcode appears to have 666 in it but dont be fooled the mark of the beast revelation 13 tells us will be in not on the right hand and in not on the forehead acording to the greek new testament therefore almost certainly a microchip implant
2196163 according to the opinion of the earl of roseberry the most significant piece of legislation passed by the english parliament since the reform act of 1832 is the old age pension act of august 1 1908 it is important from the standpoint of social or reform legislation since it is the realization of a policy to which both parties were pledged and of a hope which has been strong in the minds of the english almost ontinuously since 1893
2196164 a tuttoggi questa grande minima storia di unumile eroina del quotidiano senza retorica e senza maschere ci pare il miglior romanzo in assoluto dellanno
2196165 e rapidamente giunta una pattuglia formata da polizia e militari dellesercito
2196166 lo scooter stato bloccato da carabinieri e militari delle pattuglie miste al parco delle cave l inseguimento iniziato in via forze armate e dove se no ndr ed terminato quando il motorino entrato nel verde una volta nel parco per i due giovani hanno bucato la gomma posteriore e sono stati bloccati e identificati mentre spingevano lo scooter verso luscita dalle nuove pattuglie miste di carabinieri e militari
2196167 militari allopera anche in via padova dove sono di pattuglia insieme agli agenti di polizia ieri sono intervenuti per sedare una lite ma lintervento in questo caso stato minimo bastato larrivo dei militari per riportare la calma
2196168 abbiamo gi ottenuto i primi importanti risultati sia in termini di deterrenza sia per riportare serenit e quieto vivere in quartieri problematici
2196169 we have eight or nine more potential victims that we know of now
2196170 i dont know if i want to use the quote bring it on but we can certainly handle what were doing today and we can do many many times more
2196171 they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
2196172 what this means is that almost any vulnerability in the browser is trivially exploitable
2196173 a lot of exploit defenses are rendered useless by browsers aslr and hardware dep are completely useless against these attacks
2196174 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
2196175 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
2196176 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable
2196177 i definitely think this will get reused soon sort of like heap spraying was
2196178 there are a ton of different paths that lead to doom
2196179 i maybe had time to examine four or five dominos
2196180 the value of this class of bugs is high enough that it justifies very extensive research
2196181 if there is such value by investing in the attacks we have to invest more
2196182 as far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever prosecuted in this country
2196183 there were so many people people sitting on the floor with computers
2196184 i was so moved but i didnt understand what he was talking about i got up and i stood at the wall a gentleman was standing there with his arms crossed and he said lady youre crying i said im sorry this is my grandson and i believe in him although i dont understand what he says would you tell me please is he good
2196185 hes very good he works for me i wouldnt have hired him if he wasnt good
2196186 and they shouldnt wait until there is a terrible disaster and then run around saying what are we going to do he found it its possible to repair it repair it right now regardless of whoever says what it has to be done because so much depends on the internet everything is on the internet
2196187 maybe hell buy me one because i bought him one
2196188 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case
2196189 that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge
2196190 location information collected by cell phone companies can provide an extraordinarily invasive glimpse into the private lives of cell phone users courts have the right under statute and the duty under the fourth amendment to demand that the government obtain a search warrant based on probable cause before seizing such sensitive information
2196191 this is only the latest of many cases where eff has been invited to brief judges considering secret surveillance requests that arent supported by probable cause we hope this court recognizes the serious fourth amendment questions that are raised by warrantless access to cell phone location information and affirms the magistrates denial of the governments surveillance request
2196192 you for example are highly critical of israel without demonstrating even the slightest inclination toward anti jewish sentiment
2196193 its in the interests of the united states to extend a helping hand to georgia russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2196194 georgia will withdraw its unit from iraq to give a proper response to russian aggression
2196195 you for example are highly critical of israel without demonstrating even the slightest inclination toward anti jewish sentiment
2196196 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2196197 we have eight or nine more potential victims that we know of now
2196198 we believe some of them may be students at uf or at santa fe college
2196199 he was shocked he was totally surprised to be arrested
2196200 clinical trial volume is growing as drug companies are downsizing and consolidating
2196201 so theyre looking to hire flexible contract resource organizations cros to manage the volume
2196202 big pharmaceuticals need to outsource to save money biotechs have to outsource because they dont have an option
2196203 the latter are patients who dont take any prescription drugs and thus are best suited for clinical trials treatment naive patients are more likely to be found in emerging markets outside of the u s and western europe
2196204 growth in this industry is increasingly happening in emerging economies like eastern europe south america and the pacific rim
2196205 when we talk to people in the industry we consistently hear them mentioned as the company that appears to be rising above the fray
2196206 this is a service business and they are doing excellent work on time on budget with clean data
2196207 the barrier to entry in this business is all about a track record
2196208 a client is unlikely to hire a company that doesnt have a track record
2196209 thats a feature of more phase three programs going on and the amount of data required

2196212 the stated us mission centers on the training of georgian troops but the georgian military is unlikely to succeed without a us combat role requiring the deployment of special forces and additional us troops
2196213 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2196214 its not about georgia any more its about america its values we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
2196215 during the soviet era krtsanisi military base outside tbilisi was home to the red army
2196216 well a story thats gotten almost no attention is that as the bush administration began to tap the resources of the caspian sea it realized that it needed to have security forces in the region but they didnt want to have an overt us military presence especially with the occupation of iraq impending and the occupation of afghanistan
2196217 according to our information as a result of the night time shelling of tskhinvali the number of fatalities is more than a thousand

2196233 dear lord thank you for this healthy pregnancy and for this new life lord if you could see fit to honor a few requests i would greatly appreciate it i would like this baby to be a girl i would like her to have a heart that is tender so that she will love her sister dawn unconditionally and forever i would also love her to have a strong will and a big mouth i would love for her to be able to state her opinions and to be able to tell me what she needs and where she hurts lord i need her to be able to use her big mouth to protect her sister and herself when the world messes with either of them i would appreciate any or all of these traits and if there is a small chance that she could look at little like me that would be just great

2196244 pursuing a divestiture of its dairy product recombinant bovine somatotropin rbst in the upcoming months
2196245 whats happened today could be a great victory for the american consumer
2196246 monsanto has recognized that consumers have made a choice to avoid milk made with genetically engineered growth hormones and that the dairies and markets that serve their needs are not buying milk made with their product they have clearly judged the time right to get out of the failing artificial growth hormone business
2196247 the ftc staff agrees with fda that food companies may inform consumers in advertising as in labeling that they do not use rbst
2196248 when monsanto failed to get the federal government to remove
2196249 they have clearly seen and understood that public demand is in favor of transparency and truth when it comes to whats on our plates

2196258 its crazy to show your opponent in a positive light as the recipient of the adulation of adoring throngs of the multitudes let alone to compare him to relatively popular celebrities whats interesting is that the politician of same old same old has given us a negative ad thats anything but
2196259 what john mccain has been able to do is to shake the spotlight away from obama to nudge him off the pedestal he was on in the aftermath of his world tour at least a little bit

2196288 to gather resolutions calling for the impeachment from provincial assemblies and for the national assembly to formally approve the start of proceedings

2196301 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2196302 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged

2196308 my dear friend jaymes and i are so excited to announce the birth of
2196309 faye aiken clays mother told raleigh radio station wral that her sons longtime producer gave birth to son parker at 8 08 a m that is pretty cool if its true cuz then it would be 8 08am on 8 8 08 parker foster aiken tipped the scales at 6 pounds 2 ounces and measured in at 19 inches
2196310 the little man is healthy happy and as loud as his daddy mama jaymes is doing quite well also the aiken family the foster family and the parker family are all thrilled
2196311 its been a very helpful calling card for conversations with potential clients
2196312 to keep the games in the forefront of the minds of our personnel
2196313 i listened to my client give a talk and during his talk he said in 2007 there were 450 cases of enforcement
2196314 by april of this year there were already 500 cases
2196315 cable is taking share and it is taking it in gulps
2196316 the telcos wired businesses suddenly look not only like they are weakening they look like they are positively collapsing
2196317 because this bill would impose a significant burden on california employers at a time when efforts are being made to stimulate job growth and to improve californias business climate we cant support this measure
2196318 weve got a problem but we dont know how big it is
2196319 the jurys kind of still out on the impact but it cant be a good impact

2196321 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
2196322 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
2196323 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
2196324 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
2196325 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
2196326 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
2196327 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
2196328 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
2196329 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
2196330 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
2196331 wall street got drunk thats one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover
2196332 in a few short years eco friendly practices have gone from being new fangled selling points to becoming essential requirements with states vying with each other to offer incentives and legislation that promote green technology and business

2196338 una vez un ordenador me venci jugando al ajedrez pero no me opuso resistencia cuando pasamos al kick boxing
2196339 la inform tica tiene que ver con los ordenadores lo mismo que la astronom a con los telescopios
2196340 el ordenador naci para resolver problemas que antes no exist an
2196341 el software es como la entrop a dif cil de atrapar no pesa y cumple la segunda ley de la termodin mica es decir tiende a incrementarse
2196342 el software es un gas se expande hasta llenar su contenedor

2196352 obtener informaci n de internet es como intentar beber agua de una boca de incendios
2196353 si piensas que los usuarios de tus programas son idiotas s lo los idiotas usar n tus programas
2196354 desde el punto de vista de un programador el usuario no es m s que un perif rico que teclea cuando se le env a una petici n de lectura
2196355 los ordenadores son buenos siguiendo instrucciones no leyendo tu mente
2196356 s lo hay un problema con el sentido com n que no es demasiado com n
2196357 tus clientes m s descontentos son tu mayor fuente de aprendizaje
2196358 tenemos que cambiar la tradicional actitud ante la construcci n de software en vez de pensar que nuestra principal tarea es indicar a un ordenador qu hacer concentr monos en explicar a las personas lo que queremos que el ordenador haga
2196359 la mejor forma de obtener informaci n correcta de los foros de usenet es enviar algo incorrecto y esperar las correcciones
2196360 la mayor a de expertos est de acuerdo en que la causa m s probable de destrucci n del mundo ser a por accidente y aqu es donde entramos nosotros somos profesionales de la inform tica causamos accidentes
2196361 dicen que los pesimistas ven el vaso medio vac o los optimistas en cambio lo ven medio lleno los ingenieros por supuesto ven que el vaso es el doble de grande de lo que ser a necesario
2196362 si en una sala llena de dise adores de software dos de ellos est n de acuerdo eso es una mayor a
2196363 es importante destacar que ning n ingeniero software con tica consentir a escribir un procedimiento llamado destruirbaghdad su tica le obligar a a escribir un procedimiento destruirciudad al que se pasar a el par metro baghdad
2196364 una de las cosas m s fascinantes de los programadores es que no puedes saber si est n trabajando o no s lo con mirarlos a menudo est n sentados aparentemente tomando caf chismorreando o mirando a las nubes sin embargo es posible que est n poniendo en orden todas las ideas individuales y sin relaci n que pululan por su mente
2196365 si piensas que vales lo que sabes est s muy equivocado tus conocimientos de hoy no tienen mucho valor m s all de un par de a os lo que vales es lo que puedes llegar a aprender la facilidad con la que te adaptas a los cambios que esta profesi n nos regala tan frecuentemente
2196366 los programas deben ser escritos para que los lean las personas y s lo incidentalmente para que lo ejecuten las m quinas
2196367 comentar el c digo es como limpiar el cuarto de ba o nadie quiere hacerlo pero el resultado es siempre una experiencia m s agradable para uno mismo y sus invitados
2196368 tenemos que dejar de optimizar para programadores y comenzar a optimizar para usuarios
2196369 la programaci n en bajo nivel es buena para el alma del programador

2196372 la programaci n puede ser divertida al igual que la criptograf a sin embargo ambas no deber an combinarse
2196373 antes de que un software sea reutilizable deber a ser utilizable

2196375 ley de alzheimer de la programaci n si lees un c digo que escribiste hace m s de dos semanas es como si lo vieras por primera vez

2196377 menos del 10 del c digo tienen que ver directamente con el prop sito del sistema el resto tiene que ver con la entrada y salida validaci n de datos mantenimiento de estructuras de datos y otras labores dom sticas
2196378 si tienes una funci n o procedimiento con diez par metros probablemente hayas olvidado uno
2196379 es raro que mantener el c digo de otro desarrollador sea como entrar en un edificio de gran dise o que admiras mientras paseas por l y planeas c mo a adirle un ala o alg n elemento decorativo lo m s frecuente es que sea como tirarse de cabeza a un gran mont n de basura maloliente
2196380 la generaci n de c digo como beber alcohol es bueno si se hace con moderaci n

2196383 todo el mundo sabe el peligro de la optimizaci n prematura pienso que deber amos estar igualmente preocupados con el dise o prematuro es decir el hecho de dise ar demasiado pronto lo que un programa deber a hacer
2196384 programar sin una arquitectura o dise o en mente es como explorar una gruta s lo con una linterna no sabes d nde est s d nde has estado ni hacia d nde vas

2196388 hoy en d a la mayor a del software existe no para resolver un problema sino para actuar de interfaz con otro software
2196389 unas buenas especificaciones incrementar la productividad del programador mucho m s de lo que puede hacerlo cualquier herramienta o t cnica
2196390 la diferencia entre la teor a y la pr ctica es que en teor a no hay diferencia entre la teor a y la pr ctica
2196391 por norma los sistemas software no funcionan bien hasta que han sido utilizados y han fallado repetidamente en entornos reales
2196392 si el c digo y los comentarios no coinciden posiblemente ambos sean err neos
2196393 creo que es una nueva caracter stica no le cuentes a nadie que fue un accidente
2196394 si no las capturas y procesas cerramos tu aplicaci n esto incrementa enormemente la fiabilidad de tu sistema
2196395 cuando se est depurando el programador novato introduce c digo correctivo el experto elimina el c digo defectuoso
2196396 en un proyecto software con diez personas probablemente tres de ellas introducen tantos errores que podr amos considerar su productividad como negativa
2196397 es inevitable que la gente programe mal y la formaci n no mejorar sustancialmente las cosas tenemos que aprender a vivir con ello
2196398 el testing de componentes puede ser muy efectivo para mostrar la presencia de errores pero absolutamente inadecuado para demostrar su ausencia

2196410 unix es simple s lo necesita un genio para entender su simplicidad
2196411 algunos desarrolladores cuando se enfrentan a un problema piensan que la soluci n es usar expresiones regulares en este momento ya tienen dos problemas
2196412 pienso que los virus inform ticos muestran la naturaleza humana la nica forma de vida que hemos creado hasta el momento es puramente destructiva
2196413 el nico sistema seguro es aqu l que est apagado en el interior de un bloque de hormig n protegido en una habitaci n sellada rodeada por guardias armados
2196414 saber romper medidas de seguridad no hacen que seas hacker al igual que saber hacer un puente en un coche no te convierte en un ingeniero de automoci n
2196415 las organizaciones gastan millones de d lares en firewalls y dispositivos de seguridad pero tiran el dinero porque ninguna de estas medidas cubre el eslab n m s d bil de la cadena de seguridad la gente que usa y administra los ordenadores
2196416 si piensas que la tecnolog a puede solucionar tus problemas de seguridad est claro que ni entiendes los problemas ni entiendes la tecnolog a

2196442 in the construction zone they posted it at 45 miles per hour
2196443 most of the vehicles were seeing are not reducing their speed theyre maintaining 65 miles per hour right now were targeting the people who are traveling in the higher excess of that posted speed in that area
2196444 we can have one person actually slowing down to the 45 miles per hour and you have another person coming up behind them at 65 were seeing rear end collisions
2196445 its also for the protection of the people out there on the side of the road
2196446 weve got the construction workers standing there flagging weve got people there preoccupied with the paving project our main concerns are their safety on the side of the road and the other motorists that are doing what they can to slow down

2196461 vraag je of we los van engeland willen zijn of vraag je of we onafhankelijk willen zijn de labourpartij zegt dat we ons willen afscheiden van engeland maar wij zeggen dat we onafhankelijk willen zijn veel engelse politici zullen ertegen vechten maar dit streven is niet te stuiten
2196462 als we onafhankelijk zijn kunnen we de dienstverlening verbeteren dan kunnen ook de belastingen omlaag
2196463 het afgelopen jaar hebben we meer geld besteed aan onderwijs ouderenzorg en medicijnen de medicijnen zijn nu zelfs gratis bij volledige onafhankelijkheid zal meer van dit soort maatregelen mogelijk zijn zodra we onafhankelijk zijn komt er ook een beter alcoholbeleid ook zorgen we voor meer banen en huizen
2196464 bort moet al die jaren in een grot hebben geleefd we maken alles beter en hebben voor elke situatie een goed beleid
2196465 hij weet niet waarover hij het heeft het gaat niet om protest we stemmen toch niet om te protesteren we stemmen voor de kwaliteit van leven en het is niet specifiek de snp die groeit het gaat de kiezer om zijn eigen prioriteiten hij wil dat zijn belastinggeld zo wordt besteed dat zijn kinderen niet hoeven te emigreren vanwege bijvoorbeeld slecht onderwijs
2196466 natuurlijk niet veel britse regeringen werden geleid door een schotse premier maar voerden engels beleid ze hebben niets gedaan voor schotse belangen dat willen we nu veranderen de groenen willen ook onafhankelijkheid alleen willen zij buiten de europese unie blijven ze denken dat ze op die manier dingen beter af te zijn wij als snp willen bij de eu blijven op die manier kunnen we ook idee n uitwisselen over belangrijke kwesties
2196467 in 1817 was schotland zelfs het rijkste land ter wereld het industrialiseerde veel eerder dan engeland
2196468 dat we altijd zon grote invloed hebben gehad op engeland komt door onze schotse agressie
2196469 er zijn nu 27 naties in de europese unie en wij willen de 28e worden we willen niet worden geregeerd door buitenlanders uit engeland
2196470 dan hebben we de mogelijkheid om meer banen te cre ren en om drugsverslaving en dakloosheid beter te bestrijden
2196471 ik zal het uitleggen we willen net als holland zijn waarom mogen jullie meer zelfstandigheid hebben dat is niet eerlijk we willen niet de helft van de cake maar de hele cake dezelfde rechten en dezelfde verantwoordelijkheden als andere europese landen
2196472 een onafhankelijk schotland voorkomt dat het grootste deel van onze olieopbrengsten naar londen blijft vloeien economisch gezien zou schotland het prima zonder engeland redden
2196473 maar het is geen wedstrijd we leven als engelsen en schotten gewoon naast elkaar de engelsen houden van de schotten en de schotten houden van de engelsen en ze spreken dezelfde taal maar we willen niet door de engelsen worden geregeerd
2196474 drugs zijn een probleem en bezorgen schotland een slecht imago we proberen mensen heropvoedingstherapie te geven therapie is wel duurder maar werkt veel beter dan methadonverstrekking methadon is namelijk net zo verslavend als harddrugs
2196475 we geven alcoholvoorlichting aan jongeren om hun belangstelling voor alcohol te verminderen ook maken we alcohol duurder en proberen we supermarkten beperkingen op te leggen bij de verkoop aan jongeren
2196476 alcoholmisbruik is een ingewikkelder probleem dan drugsverslaving de wetten komen namelijk uit londen misbruik heeft vooral plaats onder jonge mensen om alcoholgebruik onder jongeren tegen te gaan hebben we onder andere het volgende plan mensen die alcohol verkopen aan jongeren onder de 18 jaar verliezen hun rijbewijs
2196477 we hebben geen beleid ten aanzien van abortus want dat is geen issue in schotland wij zien abortus als een gewetenskwestie waarbij iedereen vrij is om te bepalen wat hij doet sommigen zijn voor sommigen tegen
2196478 natuurlijk bevorderen we de vrijheid van godsdienst de snp zelf is echter voornamelijk een athe stische partij
2196479 wel eens iets anders dan gemeenschap met een vrouw willen ervaren
2196480 de kerk is vaker van mening veranderd bijvoorbeeld over het uitlenen van geld met rente en het toestaan van anticonceptiemiddelen het homovraagstuk wordt ook zon kwestie

2196491 er is een groep marokkaanse drugsrunners die nergens voor terugdeinst
2196492 ze mishandelen onwillige fransen slaan hun autoruiten in of pakken hun telefoons af de runners gaan op de snelweg naast een auto met een frans kenteken rijden ze dwingen de auto hen te volgen desnoods drukken ze de automobilist van de weg ook als het gaat om een franse opa en oma en hun twee kleinkinderen die niet voor drugs naar nederland komen
2196493 ze rijden s nachts met 240 kilometer per uur richting de belgische grens soms met de lichten uit om achtervolgers van zich af te schudden zo nodig scheuren ze tegen de rijrichting in
2196494 soms zie ik die franse drugsgebruikers in mijn buurt rijden ze rijden nogal eens hoekig en agressief
2196495 ik heb hier een stang naast me liggen die biedt altijd een stukje zekerheid
2196496 we vragen bij de gemeente een plattegrond van het huis op we willen bijvoorbeeld weten waar de deuren zich bevinden of er sensoren zijn waar rolluiken zitten en waar we onze autos op een strategische plek kunnen parkeren
2196497 er zaten mensen op het balkon dus een foto maken ging niet
2196498 dan zetten we daar tijdens de inval ook een koppeltje neer

2196558 s morgens bid ik om bewaring maar het voelt een beetje dubbel
2196559 ik was negentien toen ik voor het eerst met een bergsportkamp meeging naar de franse alpen ik was direct verkocht daarna ging ik nog een keer en nog een keer ik maakte een driedaagse tocht een vijfdaagse in het begin was het veel wandelen en weinig klimmen maar dat werd vanzelf anders die eerste keer hoog in de bergen was een geweldige ervaring de stilte je hoort helemaal niets het gave uitzicht de ongerepte natuur het lekker actief bezig zijn wat is de schepping mooi ik heb ontzag gekregen voor de bergen
2196560 tijdens een rustpauze werd ik in mn rug geraakt door een vallende steen gelukkig had ik geen ernstige verwondingen maar de ehbo moest er wel aan te pas komen daarv r was ik al een keer uitgegleden toch overheersen de positieve ervaringen het is een sensatie om helemaal uit de bewoonde wereld te zijn en als eerste je voeten in verse sneeuw te zetten
2196561 het ongeluk op de mont dolent heeft me dagen beziggehouden ik heb precies dezelfde route gelopen toen ik ervan hoorde ben ik gelijk gaan mailen met mijn tochtgenoten van vorig jaar je hebt de behoefte om met elkaar na te gaan waar is het ongeluk precies gebeurd en wat is er fout gegaan ik herinner me de plaats als gevaarlijk er zit een lastig stukje in een ijswandje waar je erg goed moet opletten
2196562 ik kan me de drang bij andere bergbeklimmers voorstellen maar het gaat mij veel te ver de hoogste berg die ik tot nu toe heb beklommen is 4206 meter de k2 is ruim 8600 meter meer dan het dubbele de beklimming daarvan zou ik voor mezelf niet verantwoord vinden de berg is klimtechnisch de moeilijkste ter wereld er is een grote kans op lawines er zijn verraderlijke kloven en het weer verandert er snel
2196563 we zijn allebei lid van de koninklijke nederlandse klim en bergsport vereniging en volgen daar geregeld cursussen bijvoorbeeld hoe je een standplaats kunt maken hoe je je kunt zekeren aan de ijs of rotswand hoe je met een ijsboor moet omgaan en hoe je iemand uit een gletsjerspleet kunt halen het allerbelangrijkste bij het bergbeklimmen is dat je op tijd op de rem trapt als je een stap vooruit niet vertrouwt moet je die ook niet zetten dat vraagt veel zelfdiscipline ik ben iemand die voor het avontuur voor de uitdaging gaat toch heb ik onderweg meerdere keren gezegd ik ga terug want dit is me te gevaarlijk of ik kan die bergtop wel bereiken maar ik moet straks ook nog de afdaling maken en dat zie ik niet zitten
2196564 als je s morgens vroeg vertrekt kun je aan het eind van de middag weer thuis zijn dan ben je helemaal gaar maar heb je ook een voldaan gevoel
2196565 een graatje is een bergkam die aan beide kanten steil naar beneden gaat op zon plek moet je ontzettend uitkijken waar je loopt overhangende sneeuw betekent dat je niet precies weet waar de bergwand eindigt als je te ver naar de rand gaat zak je door de sneeuw en val je naar beneden over een gletsjer lopen kan gevaarlijk zijn vanwege spleten wanneer er sneeuw op ligt zijn ze moeilijk te zien en kun je erin vallen
2196566 ik bestudeer de route maak een tijdsplanning en hou daarbij rekening met het niveau van de andere deelnemers dat is verantwoordelijk werk je moet continu alert zijn op gletsjerspleten ijs en sneeuwcondities en een plotselinge weersomslag
2196567 nee maar ik heb wel eens gedacht als ik nu uitglij is het met me gebeurd op zon moment moet ik ontzettend goed mn verstand gebruiken en mn concentratie niet verliezen de meeste keren gaat het gewoon goed maar die garantie heb je natuurlijk nooit
2196568 natuurlijk denk ik onderweg ik wil wel graag mn man en kinderen levend terugzien dat maakt mij voorzichtig tegelijk denk ik hoeveel mensen uit de reformatorische gezindte gaan tijdens hun vakantie niet slecht voorbereid een bergwandeling maken zij lopen misschien wel meer risico het is een feit dat de meeste ongelukken in de bergen met slecht voorbereide wandelaars gebeuren en niet met ervaren klimmers
2196569 ik ben drie dagen per week gymlerares op de pieter zandt in kampen dat is op zich al een goede training verder ga ik twee keer per week hardlopen en voetbal ik soms ik hou van fysieke uitdagingen van het opzoeken van mn grenzen
2196570 we zijn al met ze naar een berghut op 3200 meter hoogte geweest ik moet eerlijk zeggen dat ze in het begin haast niet wilden lopen na vijf stappen waren ze al moe mijn man en ik baalden daar natuurlijk flink van maar nu beginnen de kinderen het steeds leuker te vinden
2196571 ja ik besef dat ik risicos neem maar ik kan bepaalde risicos uitsluiten door me goed voor te bereiden
2196572 ik kom liever om in de bergen dan op de weg
2196573 ik bid om bewaring maar het voelt een beetje dubbel dat geef ik eerlijk toe aan de andere kant heb ik tot nu toe meer blessures opgelopen in mijn werk als gymlerares dan met bergbeklimmen tijdens een voetbalwedstrijd tegen leerlingen werd ik onderuitgehaald daar heb ik blijvende klachten aan mijn hand aan overgehouden
2196574 als ze straks zelfstandig de bergtochten willen maken die ik allemaal gemaakt heb zal ik toch even moeten slikken
2196575 de film gaat over twee bergbeklimmers de ene een christen gaat voorzichtig te werk de andere een ongelovige neemt veel risicos de christen komt om het leven doordat hij het leven van zijn ongelovige tochtgenoot redt dat leidt ertoe dat ook de niet christen tot geloof komt ik vereenzelvig me met die eerste bergbeklimmer ik stel mijn leven niet in de waagschaal en neem beheersbare risicos dat betekent dat ik me beperk tot niet al te moeilijke beklimmingen
2196576 maniobra de ch vez con bonos argentinos hundi al mercado
2196577 papeles de la deuda local se desplomaron hasta el 6
2196578 el desplome de los precios de los bonos argentinos demostr ayer que el mercado financiero tiene cada vez m s reparos sobre la capacidad del gobierno para revertir el pesimismo que despierta la pol tica econ mica
2196579 fue una se al clara de que todos los bonos deb an bajar de precio para acompa ar esa suba en el rendimiento de la deuda argentina

2196585 i got to the hospital with about twenty minutes to spare to witness the birth of my daughter then to be able to go back and win a gold medal with my parents in attendance it was a blessing
2196586 i didnt really start to develop a strong interest in competing in the olympics until college i tried out for the olympics in 1988 and was the last player cut i played pretty well throughout the trials but coach thompson honestly put a lot more emphasis on education and he wanted me to get back to school so i could be ready to start my freshman year on time if i wouldve been on the team i wouldve missed a big portion of orientation but that experience alone sparked my interest in international basketball
2196587 coach thompson was the coach so part of the olympic training camps was on campus we practiced in mcdonough gym and lived up in village a so all those players like david robinson mitch richmond dan majerle and danny manning were all living in village a
2196588 playing with that team just enabled me to understand the overall experience of playing international basketball with that high a caliber of player
2196589 a lot of people dont realize that world championships are like the olympics for a lot of other countries so winning the world champions is like winning the olympics its just that we emphasize the olympics more in this country
2196590 it doesnt come up much anymore but i think we were a little better
2196591 but i would pay money to see that game i know id be a part of it but that wouldve been a great game to see
2196592 to be there with the best athletes in the world on that stage was an amazing feeling
2196593 its just an honor to be able to represent your country i remember going places after and having people walk up and just say thank you for representing us so well it was just an amazing feeling
2196594 we are still in the process of studying the documents no decision has been taken yet
2196595 there are some problems with the deal as far as non proliferation is concerned but we are still looking at it
2196596 it creates between the iaea and a non state npt party a new relationship in the area of safeguards and does not take up certain components of the npt such as global non proliferation
2196597 and india has come a long way in terms of democracy and the rule of law and the whole nuclear constellation of issues has evolved to the point where we just cant continue with our position that has been absolute and negative to allowing india back into the nuclear club

2196655 the chinese government and people have seriously implemented the solemn commitments made to the international society since beijing won the olympic bid in 2001
2196656 falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses dysfunction or malformations
2196657 alternative medicine finally gets the reputation it deserves and is seen for what it is a massive social and intellectual fraud
2196658 the project that in some way stands out from all the rest as a great example of integrated health
2196659 i for one would like to see statements from the arh and soh condemning homeoprophylaxis in the strong terms that peter fisher the queens own quack and medical doctor has done
2196660 we do know that there is no evidence to show that gps are shunning homeopathy nor is there evidence to show patients are not seeking homeopathy due to adverse press coverage
2196661 it is a sad day for patient choice the pct decided patients will no longer have the right to treatment that works
2196662 spending public money on witchcraft cannot be justified in a modern social healthcare system
2196663 obviously the society of homeopaths have yet to say anything
2196664 20 of the population deserve at least 0 0 something nothing too unfair about that
2196665 if you get off on reducing the nhs homeopathic budget from the present homeopathic proportions of 0 0 something to nil then fine
2196666 obviously im as guilty as the next man or woman and i reckon ive done my fair share of whinging to the bbc over jabs and to nash over the claims made by one of the homeopaths registered with them
2196667 purveyors of cam gain traction in the media and those of us dealing with chronic conditions or especially caring for children with same allergy in my case can be inundated with suggestions about homeopathy etc particularly difficult when coming from well meaning family or friends who are a bit miffed when their suggestions are not greeted with enthusiasm
2196668 i can understand that condescension often seems well deserved and well nigh irresistible but i think it risks playing into the hands of those who would have us believe that science and scientific medicine are the preserves of uncaring social elites
2196669 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2196670 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2196671 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2196672 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2196673 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2196674 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2196675 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2196676 in a much anticipated decision the california supreme court has ruled that employers cannot enforce agreements that would limit competition by former employees other than within very limited legislative exceptions
2196677 this decision has profound significance for employers doing business in california
2196678 noncompetition agreements are invalid under the business and professions code in california even if narrowly drawn
2196679 there are businesses in california that would do one of three things that this case should stop
2196680 my dear lucy i wrote this story for you but when i began it i had not realized that girls grow quicker than books as a result you are already too old for fairy tales and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still but some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again you can then take it down from some upper shelf dust it and tell me what you think of it i shall probably too deaf to hear and too old to understand a word you say but i shall still be c s lewis

2196686 as many of you know the media business has seen a lot of change over the last few years not all of it good
2196687 the app store was a big deal but thats one phone this is an entire carrier
2196688 i think saying that you are the a citizen of the world talking to 200 000 germans is very dangerous because the average american does not want to elect a president of the world
2196689 a citizen a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
2196690 i think saying that you are the a citizen of the world talking to 200 000 germans is very dangerous because the average american does not want to elect a president of the world to use up america in order to make the rest of the world feel good
2196691 a citizen a proud citizen of the united states and a fellow citizen of the world
2196692 i speak today as both a citizen of the united states and of the world
2196693 well i dont look the same as those other presidents on a dollar bill

2196695 la gente reserva paquetes que incluyen ascenso al k2 como si comprara un viaje con todo incluido a bangkok
2196696 pero quien quiera subir a un ochomil debe asumir su propia responsabilidad y ser capaz de desenvolverse de forma aut noma en tal altura
2196697 y donde hay demanda tambi n hay mercado y ste mueve mucho dinero
2196698 entonces fue una tormenta y la muerte de dos gu as lo que desencaden la tragedia en el everest ahora en el k2 fue una avalancha de hielo que bloque el camino de regreso el caso es que a los accidentados les falt la experiencia suficiente como para salvarse de forma independiente
2196699 se trata de una soberana tonter a eso no es profesional
2196700 a principios de los 80 los alpinistas que ocupaban el campamento base del everest durante la temporada de primavera habr an tenido sitio en un nico vag n del metro de par s en 1996 eran ya m s de 400 los que se hab an bajado del caballo y hab an desplegado sus tiendas lo que daba al lugar un aspecto m s bien de concierto de rock masivo
2196701 sta es una monta a en la que no se encuentran cad veres completos aqu se encuentran trozos de cuerpo arrancados es as de duro

2196708 bill clinton says that barack obama may not be ready to be president
2196709 y ou could argue that no one is ever ready to be president
2196710 i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in my first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different
2196711 hes shown a keen strategic sense in his ability to run an effective campaign he clearly can inspire and motivate people and energize them which is a very important part of being a president and hes smart as a whip so theres nothing he cant learn
2196712 i can still recall the wheat fields of st paul and the time we got caught robbin from an old hen

2196941 we found that the lower parts of tree trunks had been pierced with a drill in several places and herbicide was placed inside
2196942 when we took a closer look we found that the holes were definitely man made
2196943 this is a shameful act of vandalism and the law must come down hard on the perpetrators
2196944 with offenders given a measly 340 fine which is of course not acceptable
2196945 european policy seems to lean toward using old quarry sites as in our case this one is on the road heading towards akoursos
2196946 i think the important thing here is too look at the bigger picture
2196947 i think it makes sense to put this waste in the site of an old quarry
2196948 its better to have a legal dump which will be strictly operated rather than dumping willy nilly across the countryside

2196954 as far as i know im going to play in 2009
2196955 theres a lot of baseball left to be played this year and thats what i need to remain focused on i have to get through this year healthy but if i do that i have all intentions of playing next year
2196956 its usually one of the first things that goes through my mind
2196957 youre taking him away from the people who could help him thats not something were comfortable with right now
2196958 the team is doing great things i just want to stay out of the way believe it or not i can stay out of the way
2196959 i hope this is the last change well make for a long time
2196960 it wasnt that weird because id never done it before
2196961 hes like the pudgy guy who shows up at the company picnic everybody is laughing and then he walks away with all the trophies
2196962 its just real old and they havent kept it up ive heard stories about former mets manager art howe coming off a road trip and finding a rat a live rodent on his desk i remember us trying to catch a rat running around in the bullpen
2196963 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that

2196977 no hemos encontrado un v nculo claro entre conflictos y vih
2196978 los datos de esos pa ses no indican un aumento de la prevalencia del con vih en periodos conflictivos independiente de la prevalencia registrada al inicio del conflicto
2196979 la baja cantidad de transmisiones de vih durante las relaciones sexuales la menor cantidad de agresores portadores respecto de lo que se pensaba y la reducci n de la movilidad social durante el conflicto
2196980 limitar fondos personal e intervenciones en beneficio de otros grupos y programas para diferentes contextos que puedan tener mayores consecuencias en materia de salud p blica
2196981 la comunidad de lucha contra el sida es blanco de ataques por hacer un mal uso de los datos en pro de su objetivo de conseguir fondos
2196982 tiene baja prevalencia del vih y no es posible hablar de la enfermedad sin embargo tiene todos los ingredientes para que la situaci n empeore amplio uso de drogas inyectables inequidad y violencia de g nero generalizada poca infraestructura y alto ndice de analfabetismo
2196983 cuando termina una guerra las comunidades tratan de reunirse y se observa un aumento de la movilidad incluido el ej rcito pues la gente migra a las ciudades en busca de trabajo se construye infraestructura y de repente el pa s se abre y aumenta las probabilidades de propagaci n del virus
2196984 la lucha por el poder aumenta hay aburrimiento y el sexo es una de las cosas sobre la que los hombres mantienen control eso suele propiciar la violencia de g nero
2196985 la gente suele querer procrear despu s de los conflictos por la cantidad de p rdidas sufridas

2196988 voor het belachelijke bedrag van 65 000 euro per maand dat aan een interim directeur wordt gespendeerd kunnen ook 25 verpleegkundigen aangenomen worden dat geeft aan hoe absurd scheef de verhoudingen zijn gegroeid

2196993 once again the oil companies and their friends are standing with sen mccain the candidate for president who is proposing to offer them a 4 billion tax cut
2196994 it looks like gas station tv doesnt want the american people to know about sen obamas plan to offer working families a 1 000 energy rebate
2196995 that sounded clever except last night after all that sen mccain actually said he agreed that keeping our tires inflated was a good idea
2196996 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down
2196997 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2196998 when you get to this point of the year there are no flukes
2196999 unless you have a huge setback youre going to be there all year long

2197002 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2197003 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2197004 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2197005 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2197006 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2197007 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2197008 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2197009 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2197010 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2197011 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2197012 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2197013 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2197014 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2197015 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2197016 just as i have opposed additional consolidation in air passenger service i have serious concerns about the ups dhl alliance my concerns include the transactions effects on service costs consumer choice and jobs
2197017 this alliance is likely to eliminate two cargo air carriers abx and astar which now serve dhl and compete with ups this would lessen or even eliminate competition between ups and dhl in providing overnight package delivery services
2197018 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2197019 its not that youre not ready barak obama is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with

2197029 the political consequences of leaving something like this unattended are fairly severe
2197030 if no response is made it festers and the people who make decisions about opportunities to make speeches or be on the ticket or be in the cabinet or play any significant role politically have to take these things into consideration
2197031 the story has taken on a life of its own regardless of what the underlying facts may or may not be
2197032 i dont think his potential is in any sense limited to making a speech at the convention or being on the ticket
2197033 it just becomes inherently problematic to come to the convention when you know that there will the largest gathering of media outside the olympics bored to death desperate for a story other than whats been prepackaged for them

2197040 heres one of the many reasons newspapers are dying they have lost connection with the public
2197041 one of the hottest topics around town is the crime and violence associated with street gangs who terrorize so much of the city and the current specific hot topic is the senseless murders of innocent victims by illegal immigrant gangbangers the daily news has six stories today about la city government including photos and prominent display to opening of nine three way crosswalks while the times has two on local government neither paper has any stories about how the people and their dealings and view of city government there is no coverage of kabc radio talk show host doug mcintyres protest rally and broadcast in support of jamiels law although radio and tv stations did cover it the focus on government and not people and community activism is a subject barbara osborn and i will be talking about this afternoon at 3 30 p m on kpfk 90 7fm and taking calls from listeners

2197054 the decisions nice has to make are some of the hardest in public life
2197055 nhs resources are not limitless and nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs
2197056 although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources
2197057 the possibility that we clinicians may be prevented from offering sutent to our patients is an outrage and a devastating blow to the kidney cancer community
2197058 if this draft guidance is not overturned there will be no point in me accepting referrals of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer as three quarters of patients do not gain any real benefit from interferon leaving only the option of palliative care
2197059 this decision will mean that the uk will have the poorest survival figures for metastatic renal cell cancer in europe
2197060 sutent produces a remarkable effect on survival for patients it is now no longer ethical or reasonable for patients to have access to treatment with only interferon

2197062 when we look at global targets none of us believes that it will be 100 percent everywhere
2197063 but if you look at individual countries and if you look at the percent that have achieved universal coverage or will be close to universal coverage there may be much more than you may think of
2197064 what weve seen is that in a number of countries theyve already reached their universal access targets others not
2197065 if you are in the lower tranche of middle income countries you would contribute lets say 30 percent and the global fund would contribute 70 percent
2197066 if you are in the upper tranche of middle income countries the global fund would contribute 30 percent and you would contribute 70 percent
2197067 i think this opens the door to china and one day maybe india but at least to those countries that are generating so much wealth
2197068 it takes time before you actually bring those people to the table
2197069 china can perfectly pay the treatment of every single chinese who need it with hiv mexico can do it
2197070 its a matter of political choices in terms of allocation of resources if these countries do that then the money from the global fund and international donors can concentrate on the poorest countries
2197071 what were finding is that human beings are probably driven tremendously by comparison unless you understand those comparisons youre not going to understand the rate of obesity
2197072 understanding the sociology of obesity is much more important than understanding the biology

2197191 two planes from jakarta to pontianak airport were delayed this morning due to the thick haze
2197192 it has happened since yesterday but the most significant disruption was this morning when it reached only 500 metres yards
2197193 i dont even have a word for it im just so happy very happy
2197194 this guy has been tried hes been given the sentence hes been given and if the government tried to keep him past that 5 1 2 months his defense team which is very dedicated to him would be all over them and i dont think the administration wants to brook that kind of world reaction
2197195 they also got slapped down on the conspiracy charge so they had a double defeat here in some ways

2197201 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
2197202 we thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access to the flask and we were able to rule out all but dr ivins
2197203 there are dozens if not hundreds of scientists contractors students professors who used that same anthrax the very anthrax that would have the same genetic component
2197204 it is reasonable to conclude that the federal eagle envelopes utilized in the attacks were purchased from a post office in maryland or virginia
2197205 post offices that service the entire width of the state of maryland and then the biggest post office in the state of virginia
2197206 dr ivins had not spent this many off hours in the lab at any time before or after this period
2197207 i got your e mail making me wonder if you thought that i was trying to get something from you by sending you care packages christmas or birthday gifts etc that had me rather worried so i decided to send you the things but from different places and with different names
2197208 where is a witness that can put him in new jersey
2197209 there is no motive that has been suggested to me that makes any sense
2197210 it is frightening to me as a citizen and certainly as a defense attorney for people to characterize citizens who have trouble or questions or disputes with members of congress as having a dark side
2197211 thats the only thing i can comment to that that does not prove a thing
2197212 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him
2197213 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
2197214 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but its compelling evidence and our view is we are confident it would have helped us prove this case against dr ivins beyond a reasonable doubt
2197215 rb ryan torain today he broke a little bone in the radius in the upper part of the elbow
2197216 we dont convict people on the idea that they may demonstrate eccentric behavior or that they had the opportunity to commit a crime or had the knowledge to commit a crime and thats what the governments saying
2197217 if youre the anthrax killer and youre this evil genius that knows all about anthrax why would you leave it in precisely the same genetic state one year later one month later seven years later as it was in at the time of the killings
2197218 nobody saw him in new jersey they dont have any restaurant receipts or gas receipts or surveillance tapes or witnesses wheres a witness that can put him in new jersey or put him on the way to new jersey or put him on the way back from new jersey or having in his car a new jersey turnpike toll receipt
2197219 circumstantial evidence sure some of it is but its compelling evidence and our view is we are confident it would have helped us prove this case against dr ivins beyond a reasonable doubt
2197220 if i were the government i would be saying that as well
2197221 i think the truth be told this would have been a very tough case and i think its fair to say that the government should be very satisfied that they dont have to play that out and see how good of a case it is
2197222 can they point to any evidence that shows he actually did anything that constitutes these anthrax attacks was present at the place where these letters were mailed ever admitted it to any single person or to himself in a journal or diary entry or discussed it with another person
2197223 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
2197224 we thoroughly investigated every other person who could have had access to the flask and we were able to rule out all but dr ivins

2197237 maybe i dont have direct evidence that theyre having an affair
2197238 you have to infer that theres been a death and that its been murder
2197239 probably 90 percent of the cases that are tried every day
2197240 can draw its own conclusions based upon the evidence the government has presented and the arguments and contrary positions that his defense lawyer has taken
2197241 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him
2197242 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks

2197247 this was a vengeful attack out of all proportion to what may have gone on before and no mercy was shown
2197248 martin was a charming loving boy who has left us with cherished memories that will remain with us forever
2197249 the pain that martins death has caused for our family is indescribable life will never be the same a piece of our heart has been taken
2197250 we as a family will never make sense of the unnecessary suffering that was inflicted upon martin
2197251 it was extremely sad to be burying martin at the tender age of 14
2197252 we thank god for the strength that he has given us throughout this whole unimaginable experience
2197253 its tough to judge the night because you feel like youre a little uncomfortable a little unpredictable and all of a sudden its 6 2 5 2 and youre in control but theres no real pattern to the point no set way the match is going
2197254 he serves really big and then kind of plays funky after that
2197255 he plays weird drop shots at weird times from a rhythm perspective thats probably not the best option

2197288 the average fare has been up this summer as much as 15 percent year over year
2197289 the reason that airlines overbook flights is that people dont show up
2197290 if youre one minute late youre not only denied access to the plane but also denied boarding compensation
2197291 plenty of wiggle room for the airlines to cut fares compared to what weve seen in the summer

2197323 as the don you control the family sending some of your men on missions while heading off into action with others the combination of strategic organized crime gameplay and brutal blackhand action sets the godfather ii apart from other open world games
2197324 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
2197325 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new
2197326 the godfather has become an exceptional gaming franchise for the studio
2197327 the videogame takes the story and gameplay to the next level with an innovative open world action strategy that is both compelling and intriguing for gamers

2197381 interpreting is intellectual w out feeling understanding is the feeling the spirit or living the course
2197382 the most important thing about a course in miracles is not that we believe what it says but that we understand ourselves in relation to what it says
2197383 how can i understand myself in relation to what it says if my understanding of it depends on what may be faulty assumptions definitions or reasoning and how can i have some assurance of my assumptions definitions or reasoning if they are not supported by those who are more advanced than i in a course in miracles
2197384 nothing i see means anything now look slowly around you and practice applying this idea very specifically to whatever you see notice that these statements are not arranged in any order and make no allowance for differences in the kinds of things to which they are applied that is the purpose of the exercise the statement should merely be applied to anything you see as you practice the idea for the day use it totally indiscriminately do not attempt to apply it to everything you see for these exercises should not become ritualistic only be sure that nothing you see is specifically excluded one thing is like another as far as the application of the idea is concerned

2197447 we are excited to add anna and chanda to the roster of players in charlotte as we continue to expand the entertainment options on the outback champions series
2197448 one of the most frequent comments we hear from our fans is the desire to see their favorite female players play at our events we are delighted to be able to provide this for our fans with the addition of these mixed doubles matches in charlotte featuring anna chanda and some of our outback champions series players
2197449 the tennis champion had never definitely announced that he would go abroad this year if picked for the olympic team two months ago tilden said he did not think he would go because of the sharp competition expected in the national singles and in the davis cup matches he said he regarded the davis cup competition more important than the olympics and that he felt he could husband his strength for those matches in the event he is to be one of the contestants
2197450 suzanne lenglen the worlds champion watched some of the matches until the sun became too uncomfortably warm for her she looked thinner than usual mlle lenglen said she still felt ill and her appearance bore out her statement
2197451 i am the one the world has been waiting for
2197452 the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2197453 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2197454 the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
2197455 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok
2197456 no tim pawlenty is not a nice guy hes a dick
2197457 simply a dick that knows that mccain is getting his ass kicked and sort of knows why
2197458 it is the moral obligation of all self righteous representatives
2197459 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
2197460 the laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such nature they disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes such laws serve rather to encourage than to prevent homocides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man
2197461 the constitution of most of our states and of the united states assert that all power is inherent in the people that they may exercise it by themselves that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed and that they are entitled to freedom of person freedom of religion freedom of property and freedom of press
2197462 time after time it has been proven that crime decreases when the citizens are armed when only criminals have guns well you know how that scenario plays out
2197463 all too often people are coerced into something and they only know the half truth
2197464 that obviously means the other 299 900 000 citizens are against impeachment
2197465 a chicken in every pot and an iphone in every paw
2197466 we cannot step back and let this president escape accountability
2197467 if you make a mistake then stick with it with all your might
2197468 why dont you do something about the goddamn price i pay for gasoline jesus christ nobody gives a about impeaching bush fix gas or your ass is getting voted the out mark my words i just cant believe democrats are so crazy ok we understand you all have a hardon for impeaching a republican b c they impeached clinton fix oil you thanks
2197469 look at all the radicals running this government they are obamas people too
2197470 i dont have any tickets to olympics events but my family and i will watch them on tv we are looking forward to watching the sports that china will excel at like ping pong and badminton
2197471 these types of things happened only once in a thousand years
2197472 ive even bought a small television so i can watch all these football matches in my shop
2197473 we will go home tonight to watch the opening ceremony together because we dont want to run into crowds outside
2197474 its not my olympic games its not the games for the ordinary people
2197475 i want to say something international olympic committee president jacques rogge has said the games will bring fundamental changes to china i will reserve my opinions on that
2197476 i believe that eight is a good luck number but today is 88 days since the wenchuan earthquake so i have my doubts
2197477 i still feel that i can compete at this level
2197478 i won most of my matches during my career off the mental side of the game thats something which has never gone away
2197479 this is sort of a guinea pig experiment with the usta
2197480 i wanted to come out and see how the young guys here are hitting the ball and really get a sense of what were working with
2197481 we dont have the numbers that spain has or russia has in terms of producing top players so we need to look at what can be done to change that in the future
2197482 remember three months from this date good things are in store for you
2197483 nicht jeder erbitterte kleinb rger k nnte ein hitler werden aber ein st ckchen hitler steckt in jedem von ihnen
2197484 how dare you write political articles which question president obama
2197485 i wonder how the other 30 that voted for him twice and now thinks hes doing a bad job feel any remorse
2197486 if you dont vote you have no right to complain
2197487 since my iq is below 70 i am too stupid to know when i should or should not be embarrassed
2197488 blaming the current economy on bush makes no sense to someone as stupid as myself
2197489 i personally believe that u s americans are unable to do so because uh some people out there in our nation dont have maps
2197490 we should seek to establish a wall of separation between government and the economy
2197491 when was the last time you got a good paying job from someone making 50k or less
2197492 statistics show that the upper 20 of wage earners spend 50 of all purchases
2197493 when was the last time you got a good paying job from someone making 50k or less no its those evil rich people writing your paychecks or at least mine
2197494 the obama promise of increased corporate payroll and social security taxes
2197495 most of us work for a guy that started a business
2197496 about three quarters of all u s business firms have no payroll
2197497 the social security tax is on income up to 90k above that you dont pay additional ss tax obama wants to eliminate that cap
2197498 capital gains taxes affect all investors those earning 50k and those earning 5 million
2197499 workers currently pay social security taxes on the first 90 000 of their wages some people have suggested that the cap be raised or even eliminated altogether the result would be the largest tax increase in u s history 541 billion in new taxes over the first five years alone that tax increase would fall primarily not on the superrich but on many upper middle class families and small businesses many experts believe that such an enormous tax increase would hurt the u s economy and cost millions of jobs even worse it would do relatively little to fix social security studies show that removing the tax cap altogether would extend the solvency of social security by only seven years
2197500 one possible option for example is to raise the cap on the amount of income subject to the social security tax if we kept the payroll tax rate exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
2197501 one possible option for example is to raise the cap on the amount of income subject to the social security tax
2197502 oh so it matters which pocket youre stealing the money from
2197503 my uncle is a millionaire and he still works for the business he started 25 years ago in the technology industry
2197504 if we kept the payroll tax rate exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500
2197505 who cares hes a millionaire and hes a wage earner that along disproves your statement
2197506 im sick and tired of seeing highschool dropouts parroting fox
2197507 and the distribution of wealth is the most uneven its been in years
2197508 1st of all their taxes are lower now then they have been for a long time
2197509 2nd rich people will not start laying people off to save money this is a myth that they would love you to believe if they thought they could save money by laying people off they would and have already done it
2197510 3rd as far as i know obama is offering tax breaks for lower and middle class people of 1000 yr john mccain is offering oil company tax breaks of 4 billion a year which makes more sense
2197511 1st of all their taxes are lower now then they have been for a long time
2197512 honey i havent beat on you nearly as much this year as i did last year why are you complaining
2197513 regular people are suffering and the distribution of wealth is the most uneven its been in years
2197514 they seem to do a lot more gathering than sharing
2197515 the top 1 3 of americans pays 2 3 of the nations taxes
2197516 if they thought they could save money by laying people off they would and have already done it
2197517 cutting taxes works if theres a fiscal conservative in charge
2197518 yeah roddack tell that to the western europeans who enjoy a much higher standard of living then we do
2197519 i read the other day that in the last year the richest ten percent of u s working people had a 60 000 rise in income the other ninety percent just over 400
2197520 actual studies have shown that places with higher miniumum wages have much healthier economies
2197521 draw the parallel with the same kind of bold leadership that mccain demonstrated in pushing the surge strategy that allowed us to win in iraq
2197522 a go get the skills you need to earn more money b piss and moan and stick your hand out for the government
2197523 in cases of small mom and pop operations this loss of profit actually makes the business lose money the shop has a choice let go of some of the workers or face bankruptcy
2197524 i said if you cant make more than a minimum wage job you have bigger problems than the government
2197525 you want to ensure that any old dumbass high school dropout can get a job in other words youre rewarding failure i think those people should stay in school and not be massive
2197526 but you forget that the larger corporations overhead cost is a lot less than the mom and pop shop because of the volume in which larger corporations are able to buy their goods get them larger discounts
2197527 are you seriously not going to admit that when minimum wage goes up that it does not put more small privately owned stores out of business that they were doing fine with before the wage hike
2197528 so you want only people who stay in school to be able to get what minimum wage jobs are left
2197529 you want to ensure that any old dumbass high school dropout can get a job in other words youre rewarding failure i think those people should stay in school and not be massive
2197530 unemployment among losers sure cry me a river for the ghetto hoodrats
2197531 also politicians who want to increase the minimum wage do so not to help the poor they do it to increase union wages which are indexed to the minimum wage
2197532 maybe employees should focus on being worth more than 6 55 hr
2197533 where are you getting this nonsense union wages are decided through direct negotiations between unions and employers
2197534 yeah admin assistants are a dime a dozen but is my wifes uncle worth 10 times as much
2197535 increasing sales of his product means more of that product needs to be produced
2197536 a lot of sour grapes concerning where peoples lives have ended up
2197537 full employment occurs when everyone in the economy who is willing to work at the current market rate for someone of his skills have jobs
2197538 all of my life i carried a single image of my father one that i tried to take as my own
2197539 the democratic socialists of america dsa is the largest socialist organization in the united states and the principal u s affiliate of the socialist international dsas members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly socialist presence in american communities and politics
2197540 intense fighting is going on between soldiers and taliban since friday morning
2197541 the area is closed because of a possible terrorist attack its just a defensive measure
2197542 but if i talk about them anymore the police will come and take me away
2197543 there can be no question china has achieved something truly special
2197544 you mean they got someone in your office who can speak the language
2197545 she simply refused to follow the sacred no laughing rule as i spoke
2197546 it used to be jammu amp kashmir now its jammu vs kashmir
2197547 the land issue is now symbolic and its the issue of our dignity as in the past 60 years
2197548 but by trying to choke us economically theyre proving it was only a marriage of convenience we too dont want them anymore
2197549 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire
2197550 we suspect this is a threat related to the olympics
2197551 it is a time when we must be extra careful about safety and we should not draw easy conclusions
2197552 grand opening ceremony in tibet a few thousand tibetans will be in prison for merely practicing their freedom of expression
2197553 with protests around the world and in beijing the festival of peaceful activism has begun
2197554 we cant keep going back at it with pakistan cmon man where would that leave us
2197555 weve done war were in a different place now its not about india pakistan
2197556 its about india what can we do as a country what can we achieve
2197557 what do i care for pakistan we should all leave each other alone
2197558 we know the promise is weak but there is relatively little india can do short of military action and we do not have the stomach for that
2197559 danger is everywhere but i have to live my life
2197560 we cannot think of a better day to celebrate the beginning of a happy new family and the happiest moment for our country these two things should go hand in hand
2197561 we will always choose a lucky date for important events such as giving birth in the year of the pig or getting married or starting a new business venture on a prosperous date
2197562 if it werent for today we would have chosen valentines day to get married
2197563 chinese people always believe in the lucky number eight but there have also been many tragedies in 2008
2197564 china has an ancient culture and this shows how the culture has developed
2197565 i dont have time to watch i have to make money
2197566 its not my olympic games its not the games for the ordinary people
2197567 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2197568 we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2197569 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2197570 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2197571 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2197572 to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2197573 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
2197574 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2197575 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2197576 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2197577 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can
2197578 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2197579 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2197580 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2197581 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2197582 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2197583 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2197584 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2197585 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2197586 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2197587 on 9 11 there will be a huge attack on the us by terrorists flying planes in to the world trade center
2197588 from all the available sources and the brutal truth is that the bush administration has virtually no evidence whatsoever to back up their claims that bin laden perpetrated this crime
2197589 however there is an astounding amount of evidence that the people who profited the most had at least some part in orchestrating the attacks
2197590 building 7 wasnt hit by a plane and it collapsed
2197591 a feature article in the stranger has stated the film is based solely on anecdotal evidence 10 while others have criticized it for using unidentified undated and unsourced video news clips voice overs quotes and book citations without page numbers
2197592 witty sayings fear tactics and a cool assertive air all enable them to convince the unwitting public of their points
2197593 have blindly followed the documentary without doing their own research
2197594 for a film that rails against deception theres a lot of deception implicit in its creation
2197595 bin laden is mad at the u s and is determined to strike so were investigating

2197626 big science in this area of biology has lost its way
2197627 scientists are supposed to be allowed to follow the evidence wherever it may lead no matter what the implications are freedom of inquiry has been greatly compromised and this is not only anti american its anti science its anti the whole concept of learning
2197628 simply because evolution has so many flaws and major holes
2197629 the definition of propaganda is information that is spread for the purpose of promoting some cause
2197630 ok so evolution proposes a model that species can add genetic material somehow as a response to their newly hostile environment in order to survive
2197631 lets be honest we all have the same facts to work with so none of these is really science or anti science or any other emotional tag
2197632 something that has really occurred or is actually the case
2197633 science is a lens for examining the world as it is

2197637 government incompetence has led to an immigration system on the brink of meltdown yet ministers prefer to avoid debate over the true scale of the problem
2197638 we cannot continue to ignore the issue of the hundreds of thousands of people living illegally in this country to do so does nothing to solve the problem and merely helps those traffickers who currently exploit the system

2197651 back in the days when we met at the civic centre a councillor asked the policeman at the meeting what is cannabis

2197656 even for the labour party this campaign has come up with a surprising lack of new ideas voters can only expect more of the same from this party which has obviously run out of steam as anyone who has a labour council is aware
2197657 we want kids to have something much better to do
2197658 labours stance on crime and antisocial behaviour is a joke this is the party that axed funding for the popular and successful 101 non emergency number scheme when it should have been extended to all of wales
2197659 they cut the funding in whitehall and refused to support it in the assembly the 101 number continues in cardiff because the welsh liberal democrat led council has put their money where their mouth is and invested in tackling antisocial behaviour

2197663 some women are like gongs they need to be struck regularly
2197664 ive never understood why so many men have allowed themselves to be brainwashed by the feminazi myth machine into believing that rape is such a serious crime rape is simply sex women enjoy sex so rape cannot be such a terrible physical ordeal
2197665 to suggest that rape when conducted without violence is a serious crime is like suggesting that forcefeeding a woman chocolate cake is a heinous offence a woman would be more inconvenienced by having her handbag snatched
2197666 the demonisation of rape is all part of the feminazi desire to obtain power and mastery over men men who go along with the rape myth are either morons or traitors
2197667 some women are like gongs they need to be struck regularly
2197668 the vast majority of domestic assaults are initiated by the woman
2197669 unnatural and vile it is a strange kind of woman who would want to invest her energies into her job rather than into a man

2197697 we are evolving our business strategy to expand beyond licensing arrangements and to develop an operational arm of the company with this first acquisition we believe we have identified a strategically sound investment and have created a foundation for growth that is readily enhanced by other solution providers we are considering for investment and acquisition
2197698 were just fundamentally trying to take steps and build depth and look at some scheme stuff
2197699 but the schemes are not whats important to me the effort the fundamentals just general blocking and tackling and catching and running those things are important its not about who wins the scrimmage its about players right now
2197700 weve got one lady in the compliance office on a hunger strike right now so were hoping pretty soon
2197701 weve had a good amount of practices under our belt in this offense
2197702 were all comfortable in it and know what were doing and were looking to go out there and play hard
2197703 you want to be as flexible as you can be and in games where we make changes late having pieces you can move from one position on the field to another helps
2197704 and guys have kind of taken to trying new positions in practice it breaks up the work
2197705 right now raul may be there with anybody in the game
2197706 he hit a good pitch and he managed to keep it fair he hit it so hard it didnt have time to go foul
2197707 felix is not easy to handle his stuff is electric
2197708 just because you call a breaking pitch doesnt mean you know where its going
2197709 that was the hardest part it was a tough pitch to keep fair
2197710 i was just trying to hit it and it worked out for us its a great feeling
2197711 ibanez is good im not sure what the pitch was but he was able to get it and won the game for them
2197712 we had plenty of opportunities to win the game ourselves but it didnt really present itself in the ninth andy was really good for us and their guy was good for them as well
2197713 that one pitch im sure wash wishes he had back
2197714 as hes always done with the exception of his last start he was deep in the game and gave us a chance to win
2197715 ive been getting better at laying off the breaking stuff away and waiting to get better pitches to hit
2197716 the first time when i came up the team was struggling and i wanted to do so much to help out
2197717 i kind of created more pressure that i put on myself
2197718 i just have to play the game do what i do and try to be myself
2197719 in light of increasing scrutiny and todays economic headlines rising executive compensation speaks volumes about the demand for top talent

2197725 actually everyone on the planet is annoying in some way
2197726 i really allowed myself to think that one was gone
2197727 i didnt think it had any chance of staying in the ballpark
2197728 thats one of those plays where i just stood there and stared out there i went and watched it on the video highlight again
2197729 hes hit more balls off the bat that you think are going to get out and not get caught and then end up being caught
2197730 this ballpark can take some home runs away from you and it seems like belly has been the victim more than anybody
2197731 i havent thrown out of the windup all year so i felt a little inconsistent but i thought it went pretty good
2197732 i wanted to throw more off speed pitches but i was falling behind because i was working out of the windup
2197733 i was always more comfortable out of the windup my whole life
2197734 once i get comfortable out of the windup again itll just be a benefit that i can feel comfortable out of the stretch too
2197735 boy hes been some kind of player for us i wish i was his agent right now
2197736 that one i really allowed myself to think was gone
2197737 i didnt think there was any chance that ball would stay in the park
2197738 nobodys really calculating how many medals were going to win
2197739 were more concerned about having all of the international athletes and visitors coming to beijing and feeling at home were more concerned with where to take them for dinner where to take them for a tour site visit or where to take them for shopping
2197740 walking into this pool this time i could almost pinpoint what my problem was last time i dont feel scared anymore and i dont have the whole world swirling around me i feel more in control and ready to go
2197741 but i was so nervous i was hyperventilating before the race and my body went toxic halfway through the race and i was kind of sick afterward
2197742 i was definitely shocked that one saturday morning when i found out about my record
2197743 i think it kind of helped me a little bit though going into trials i dont think i was focused on breaking the record i was just focused on having a good swim making the team and that took a lot of pressure off me
2197744 if they want me great but i think we have quite a big group of girls who are more than capable of going fast for the u s
2197745 i feel like i have enough events there are some girls that should get a chance to step up they swam faster than me i think thats how it should stand

2197749 ninguna duda tengo que jam s como ahora los sectores olig rquicos de bolivia pretenden a toda costa botar a un gobierno salido de las m s profundas aspiraciones democr ticas del pueblo

2197755 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game
2197756 and there were very few big chances for the united states
2197757 if you dont go to the great wall then youre not a real man
2197758 its a little overwhelming that its really here the reality that were here

2197760 youll be walking un aided a couple of days after surgery
2197761 but amy you ran on it for over 2 months after the injury whats one more run
2197762 i guess he feels like i do im still pinching myself to make sure that im not dreaming
2197763 he said he worked hard for it he said he was coming back to claim what belongs to him
2197764 in light of what happened because it was misdemeanors he will be enrolled here this fall
2197765 i think everybody can finally breathe a sigh of relief that its behind us and we can now move forward
2197766 all three of those freshmen have a chance to come in and impact
2197767 but with skill level and ability to pass and rebound as well as score he can really come in as a freshman and do big things
2197768 i feel like i went away to school and came back home
2197769 i dont feel like im here on a vacation i feel like im home
2197770 but mostly he was outside running up and down trying to scrape together money
2197771 until i got to about 13 or 14 i never really left west baltimore
2197772 i was very careful about who he hung around with
2197773 everyone he was with i questioned i wasnt picking his friends but i was making sure his surroundings were clear
2197774 to stay out of the trouble on myrtle avenue and down at them projects you got to find something to keep busy
2197775 when i get on a roll i just keep going and its easier for me
2197776 im confident in my game im hitting it really well and playing really solid and the putts are falling in which is wonderful
2197777 im really happy with myself that i could come back in the end
2197778 unfortunately the political powers both on the south and the north did not agree
2197779 it conceivably could be used to create solid rocket propellants or explosives
2197780 one solid propellants are much lower performing than liquids two while solid rockets are simpler than liquid systems it is easier to fill an empty liquid tank than to cast a solid motor three if i am going through the trouble to dig up and process mars dirt i would get the water first even at low water concentrations three to eight percent water and carbon dioxide can allow me to make oxygen methane or a large number of other hydrocarbon fuels
2197781 can find no credible connection between the lander itself and the perchlorate detected by meca
2197782 so our pyros are not consistent with the meca signature they are not vented and the quantity of material is very small
2197783 so at this point i dont see a credible connection to the spacecraft
2197784 we had talked about coach obrien before he went up there
2197785 dean is a very intelligent kid him and his mom surprised me with the research they had done on the computer through the internet about coach obrien he was very aware of coach obriens record
2197786 we put him on the best receiver and a lot of times lock him up man to man and he wont let the receiver get off the line of scrimmage
2197787 i always enjoyed playing there and was happy to see my wyndham friends take the tournament back to its old stomping grounds
2197788 it will be nice to see everybody and join brandt snedeker and richard petty in the ceremony that will kick off this years tournament it should be a great day
2197789 any tournament director is always looking for the wow factor sometime during the event
2197790 we definitely have it with two sports icons that are both known as the king in their respective sports it will be a thrill and an honor to host them at the wyndham championship
2197791 this is as tough an environment as we have operated in and i have been 25 years in the business
2197792 we recognise how difficult the conditions are out there and the need to be cautious but were not without focus on opportunities
2197793 this is partly down to barcaps exposure to booming areas notably interest rates commodities and emerging markets but must also be down to share gains in many segments as competitors struggle
2197794 hes a pretty tough kid and really likes to play its a shame because he broke his hand in the spring now he got rolled up on
2197795 the poor kid i think the fourth day of his freshman year he tore his anterior cruciate ligament and had surgery so that took him out for nine months even when he came back he wasnt able to do a lot of squats and power cleans and a lot of things we do with those linemen to get them bulked up
2197796 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2197797 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2197798 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2197799 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
2197800 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 down the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
2197801 this is one of the clubs that prides itself on how hard it is i dont think anyone expected it to be easy it wouldnt be a monster if it was
2197802 if you had rees jones redo scrabble hed leave out the vowels
2197803 and you do need to hit a lot of drivers on this golf course
2197804 the main impact on the industry is still on the asset side
2197805 from a pricing side the cycle is expected to go down
2197806 combination of equity and property market falls combined with a large claim event

2197810 its here and were ready to go that first day we are all pumped up for it but then theres that thing where you just keep practicing so it can be a grind after a while
2197811 all the recruiting planning and organizing is complete and now we get to strap it up and play football
2197812 most definitely you can learn how to pace yourself and when to turn it up and when to coast a little bit
2197813 you learn how to treat your body when you are nicked up or whatever
2197814 i think the biggest thing coming back into camp is to get those repetitions in getting to know each other even better
2197815 we use those first practices to work on conditioning and to try to bring the young guys up to speed in getting acclimated with our systems
2197816 our guys have worked very hard in the offseason and conditioning wise it looks like we are ready to go but it is still good to get out there and get some things worked out before we start full contact practices next week
2197817 the enkoder will work on mac os x 10 5 if youre running an older version of mac os x please use the web form instead
2197818 it was a coaches decision not up to the players
2197819 early on when i first moved from safety to linebacker i wanted to play the will position simply because the will is behind the ball more and not on the line of scrimmage and just in position to make more plays
2197820 as a player it gives me the opportunity to use what i have i can run and i think i have a better opportunity to run around and make plays at the will
2197821 its just about putting everybody in better positions putting everyone in positions where we can play faster a little more downhill
2197822 so far it seems were a little more aggressive more confident
2197823 i definitely think it will help thomas with his skills i think he can pretty much play any position on the field given the right situation he can get to the ball fast whether hes in zone coverage or man coverage but this is going to play to his strengths
2197824 its a lot of learning ive got to do based on what i played last year but im up for it im having an opportunity to make more plays and im excited about that it lets me use what i have im a faster guy and i want to get out there and show it off
2197825 ok in order to not let you dominate the hardware we will only let you use 50 of the cpu at any one time

2197830 all of this rests on the big assumption that the trends of recent decades will march on unabated liang acknowledged
2197831 at our current pace all us adults will be obese in 40 years
2197832 millions of americans went to bed with average bodies and woke up as part of the growing obesity epidemic all without gaining a pound
2197833 we have decided to exit the zune category because it just did not have the appeal we had anticipated
2197834 we have a set of great partnerships that give zune a strong presence at retail including wmt and others
2197835 we will continue to invest in retail partnerships and have seen good momentum online and at retail over the last few months

2197843 purists and to satisfy their personal desire to hear their music on a format that everyone now agrees is superior to cd and digital even with the pops and crackles
2197844 they want to hear the crackle of the needle and they are the hardest of hardcore music fans powderfingers manager paul piticco said
2197845 and for me and powderfinger who grew up on vinyl for us that connects an aural pathway back to when we first discovered music
2197846 at first the few people who stopped were wondering what i was doing helping him but i reassured them i was a doctor on australian tv anyway she said

2197848 when we give to the world what we want the most for ourselves we heal the broken part inside of us
2197849 somewhere along the line of development we discover what we really are and then we make our real decision for which we are responsible make that decision primarily for yourself because you can never really live anyone elses life
2197850 when we give to the world what we want the most for ourselves we heal the broken part inside of us
2197851 somewhere along the line of development we discover what we really are and then we make our real decision for which we are responsible make that decision primarily for yourself because you can never really live anyone elses life

2197853 i can not explain why but i just had to do it
2197854 people who make decisions for a living are coming to realize that in complex or chaotic situations a battlefield a trading floor or todays brutally competitive business environment intuition usually beats rational analysis
2197855 but it never seemed to work then wed criticize ourselves for not using the system well enough but it still never seemed to work because its the wrong system
2197856 give to us clear vision that we may know where to stand and what to stand for because unless we stand for something we shall fall for anything
2197857 i can not explain why but i just had to do it
2197858 people who make decisions for a living are coming to realize that in complex or chaotic situations a battlefield a trading floor or todays brutally competitive business environment intuition usually beats rational analysis
2197859 but it never seemed to work then wed criticize ourselves for not using the system well enough but it still never seemed to work because its the wrong system
2197860 give to us clear vision that we may know where to stand and what to stand for because unless we stand for something we shall fall for anything
2197861 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2197862 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2197863 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2197864 it is time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path
2197865 who will take the final steps to 1600 pennsylvania avenue

2197867 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
2197868 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
2197869 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
2197870 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
2197871 that is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting
2197872 that takes quite a compressor to do it takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure
2197873 can win a stage race for clean production capable vehicles that exceed 100 mpg equivalent fuel economy
2197874 the project is under progress we do not yet have any timeframe for launch
2197875 do you think somebody would actually put millions of dollars into making a car that will not pass safety regulations theres no point in doing that
2197876 i dont think we should discount this advance if it happens
2197877 i was a single mother for all my life i work hard for her
2197878 mtv asked me to do another season but i dont want to do that right now im going to do something else with my life its time to move on

2197881 zero tolerance policy against discrimination and harassment in the workplace
2197882 i can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up there are people on the island who just dont want us going down the route of this inquiry
2197883 if the test results on the final samples are no more accurate then the answer is that something very nasty happened in there we dont know exactly what and because we cant prove who or what it was there is no possibility of a successful homicide investigation
2197884 we have had problems dating the bones but instead of people saying how unfortunate it is that the science cant be of more help to us the politicians are saying this is a waste of time the fact that were trying to bring people to justice for awful abuse is ignored and its just a constant day by day attack on the inquiry and on the victims
2197885 one file has been with the attorney generals office since april 29 and its still showing no signs of moving at the moment its been very frustrating
2197886 i dont think they are involved in child abuse its more like an old boy network
2197887 the ordinary people of jersey are overwhelmingly in favour of the inquiry but how many expressions of support and sympathy for the victims have we heard from the politicians none they dont do sympathy for the victims
2197888 they had been taken from one part of the building to another and put on top of the hard compact undisturbed original floor of the cellars they had been spread about and covered with a thin layer of topsoil why would someone do that unless there was a deliberate attempt to conceal them
2197889 people might say these killings must have happened in the 60s but there may have been someone who had been working there for 30 or 40 years who knew that something had happened but even then it might not have been a homicide it could have been that children died of natural causes accidents or suicide we just dont know
2197890 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2197891 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2197892 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2197893 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2197894 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2197895 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power
2197896 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to continue counterterroism missions in iraq against al qaeda
2197897 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
2197898 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2197899 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
2197900 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital

2197904 this spring i voiced concerns about material from als past career to have remained silent when asked would have been hypocritical and dishonest i am confident my concerns have been heard and since then i have watched als campaign take steps to address these matters
2197905 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2197906 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2197907 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns
2197908 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level
2197909 i dont mind providing the programs but what the general public has to understand is that we dont manufacture money here
2197910 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2197911 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2197912 mr mcgreevey is not seeking employment because he does not need it to sustain himself
2197913 its hard to imagine a more favorable ruling for jim mcgreeveys position
2197914 i feel like i bounced back pretty good i was able to drive my fastball down low in the zone and able to establish that early my change up was probably my go to pitch my curve ball was a little lacking
2197915 those eliminate extra pitches and allowed me to go out in the seventh inning its also a momentum changer for the other team and gets us out of a jam
2197916 paiml has done a great job and with the combination of persichina and mollenhauer its a pretty nice double play combination and retherford has done a good job at third base hes been a very pleasant surprise
2197917 we kind of got spoiled last year because javier castillo made everything look pretty easy we all go through ups and downs but c j has done a nice job and he got us that added bonus run with that home run
2197918 he threw strikes mixed it up thats what its all about
2197919 you get into those later innings and its nice knowing those guys can come in and shut it down
2197920 it has been good weve had a stretch where theyve had to be good because our starters didnt get us to a point where we could enjoy a lead it was nice to have the other team chase us tonight and the bullpen did a good job again
2197921 were probably going to see gasoline at the retail level around 3 50 for labor day
2197922 you have to remember that this market has baffled anyone whos used fundamentals or charts but if youre a chartist today is the death knell for the possibility of new highs in the marketplace

2197935 from what weve been able to sense the chinese people are just so excited about this because up to now foreigners perceptions of china are very limited

2198002 keep your hands in the car at all times and stay seated until the car comes to a complete stop
2198003 in this godless world this lawless dung heap of man or at the very least in this innocent and benign world where a coward god
2198004 we stand on an edge a great and unexplored expanse stretches out before us and it is our duty to explore map and conquer this fresh and beautiful landscape
2198005 i want only to help facilitate brothers i do not desire to lead only to help clear the same path for us all if it seems ive stepped into the front and have taken it upon myself to assume any sort of role any kind of position above the both of you it is merely to get the ball rolling as they say i only wish to spread my motivation my life affords me ample free time thus ive been able to more vigilantly cultivate this abstract drive into tangible actions i will organize and help to offer up a means but we all must agree and believe in a common end together not separate and not compromised i certainly do not entertain any notions of being better than either one of you i feel closer and more unified with you two than ive ever felt with anyone else ever you are my only friends my only family my only loved ones so please trust me when i say i hope you dont find my desires pushy or even condescending ive only arrived here because of our three combined efforts and i refuse to stand any higher or posit any form of superiority over either one of you whatsoever
2198006 come now brothers dont look so glum so serious let us not be bogged down by our own inflated importance life is still ours to be had to be enjoyed twisted and rung out for our personal desires
2198007 i feel just fine phillip really i do its just well you must understand the levity of all this if we are indeed serious about this as i sincerely hope we are then it will most probably take a great deal of time at least for me to re find my balance as i view this old world through new eyes everything must crumble and it is very intimidating to even consider something of this scope let alone engineer it will take great discipline and dedication that being said i know i know i am ready willing and eager to commit fully to this revolution we have all evolved into
2198008 and you lucien what about you youve been so quiet please talk to us
2198009 come now lucien what is it we must all speak our honest thoughts at all times this is the most rudimentary the most necessary step which will start this journey of ours
2198010 if you harbor reserves if you have any doubts you should air them now we must be able to speak candidly between one another and indeed because of our past together i know that we can so then just be out with it why this reticence please share your thoughts
2198011 well its just its enormously infantile of me but well
2198012 please lucien do not think that way when have i or patrice not wanted to hear your opinions when have we thought them trite or superfluous even though you are the youngest of our family here we have never known you to be capricious or silly in your thought we have always encouraged if nothing else the absolute freedom of mind of thought i would never try to trivialize anything you had to say and if i ever have i apologize sincerely we need to hear what you have to say though lucien now more than ever before
2198013 i understand and empathize with your concerns i truly do in fact i think your concern is one of the most and possibly only valid reason for the inability to commit to the point we all arrived at in tandem yet completely upon by our own free will however that being said i must remind you that this is our precise point these very concerns are exactly what we are in need of over throwing we must confront that specific fear the death of ego and self we must altogether destroy every single thing which we have ever believed in truly believed in we must reclaim our virgin and unspoiled minds re awaken them lucid and veraciously aware of the truth behind every fa ade we have ever desperately grasped onto to explain away the pain the entire meaning buried in all of this is to in the end expose and let go of everything we believe to hold any meaning or truth we must break from all things and then break from ourselves if we posit to demand freedom we must be sincere we must be fully prepared to martyr both our deformities and our beauties for we must learn to accept that they are indeed two sides to the same coin the very same coin which you can look at alternate ways yet still in the end you are only honestly looking at one thing which is perfectly equal in and of its self we must recognize and expose this solipsism we must acknowledge this willful subservience this peculiar type of psychic hypochondria if you have the ability the authority to change something yet you dont then you have only yourself to blame and reproach your fear your inability to act equals your will to power sloth simple and clear a lack of courage yes show me a lack of courage and ill show you a mans life a miserable and inane pile of neurosis bred to believe he is powerless to enact true change a decision chance luck all is change if only you believe accordingly compromise is masked as our daily lives disguised to fool us into accepting it as savior and substantial life all is will and all decision is action and you are free to assign the grandeur to these actions however let us take into account those individuals who may very well be aware of all this yet still for one reason or another are unable to enact change what is it which holds one back assuming they have made the remedial leap past that banal level of ignorance which is the most common cause for this deficiency in the majority of people i order a glass of wine action i drink a glass of wine action both seemingly benign acts do in a very literal way change things sometimes the significance is grand and immediately apparent other times inconsequential and nearly invisible too far removed to properly trace with only one lifespan so what shall we call the difference between buying a glass of wine and buying a gun what exactly is the distinction if we throw away our preconceived notions our learned associations to the specific objects is there any difference at all obviously some will claim the differences are perfectly apparent drinking a glass of wine hurts no one except possibly your self whereas firing a gun and certainly firing one at someone is an act of violence with very serious physiological consequences however levity is all vague opinion and nothing more than prejudice in my specific opinion again only preconceptions trained and bred patterns of thought association and in due turn reactions to those associations so deeply engrained that they seem utterly natural unconscious and perfectly unaffected so if we do in fact deign to proclaim there is categorically no difference at all between actions other than how we perceive their possible outcomes then all action lies on the same equal plane so then all that truly matters is how we personally define the end not the means at all so in essence the only thing that gives meaning to life is the sum total of all our actions every single little gesture if made with the right intentions justifies the totality of those actions
2198014 we still have so much to discuss we need to organize a proper sit down so as to give this proposition of ours the attention it deserves it carries with it very serious ramifications that we should not allow ourselves to trivialize by forcing conversations about it in the street we should all meet later and attempt to initiate a serious discourse we should all be cogent focused and prepared i have many loose ends which still need to be tied up before we can truly start this the project of our lives so what say we all take a few days spend some time wrapping up all of our personal matters and then we can officially begin today is sunday so lets plan to meet again on tuesday a fresh start how would my apartment be say nine in the evening
2198015 god is not partisan god is not a republican or a democrat when either party tries to politicize god or co opt religious communities for their political agendas they make a terrible mistake the best contribution of religion is precisely not to be ideologically predictable nor loyally partisan both parties and the nation must let the prophetic voice of religion be heard faith must be free to challenge both right and left from a consistent moral ground

2198023 you lose your no 1 and you lose another guy thats been throwing the ball well for you in chamberlain its things you have to deal with
2198024 youve got to move on thats the only thing you can do in this game
2198025 you cant sit here and hang your head about it
2198026 the day i concluded that full fair and open trials were not possible under the current system
2198027 is to oppose politicizing the olympic games and especially using them to interfere in chinas domestic affairs
2198028 the pressure got to every single person on that movie at some point
2198029 it rained 12 times a day there were a tremendous amount of things to worry about from prolonged exposure to mud to the leptospirosis virus caused by every animal in creation defecating and having it flush down the mountain a lot of people were getting sick you had to cross a river out of jurassic park every day to get to work and then go up a mountain that was like something out of a cartoon
2198030 a couple of people got bit by centipedes its like getting shot by a gun apparently you have to go to the hospital
2198031 hes not mean spirited hes not one of those crazy mean guys you hear about
2198032 thats not ben his drive hes obsessed with the idea of delivering the best product he can
2198033 i thought it would be funny to have actors who had done this kind of immersion suffer a post platoon syndrome instead of post traumatic stress disorder
2198034 but we never figured out how to do it you dont want people to think youre making fun of veterans in any way when youre making fun of actors who take themselves so seriously
2198035 we knew what the first act was but what do they do when theyre out there in the jungle
2198036 hes going to call me up and say i want to do a great big movie with you but i want you to have the highest risk factor
2198037 it had to be clear what we are satirizing is the character and his loss of identity so we have a black actor there
2198038 calling lazarus on every moment to be perfectly clear about our point of view we never wanted it to be ok
2198039 being nice to people is just the beginning of connecting people to your church but being nice and smiling accounts for only about 20 percent at most of actually connecting guests to a church
2198040 it is not by chance that i am using military terms to describe the settlement of the country
2198041 life support inside the battle over abortions place in the democratic platform
2198042 theyre based on the assumption that democrats position isnt in the mainstream and thats just wrong theyve not succeeded in curtailing democrats principles and i dont think they will in the future
2198043 any group calling itself pro life has serious problems if one of their flagship initiatives is called
2198044 raber takes a different tack he believes pro life democrats should form their own christian democrat party if the current dems wont loosen that abortion plank
2198045 reform of society and of conditions of life in all milieux starting with the most deprived so that always and everywhere it may be possible to give every child coming into this world a welcome worthy of a person
2198046 if you can name one instant in that last thirty years when
2198047 there is no international consistency regarding the legality of abortion
2198048 what should the state do about people who want to get or provide abortions
2198049 to have made the moral argument against abortion for example is not necessarily to have made the legal argument as well
2198050 how can anyone ever ask us why we dont offer phone support
2198051 wed like to do business with you but do you offer phone support
2198052 but if you didn t respond quickly and thoroughly or you sent me some bs auto responder and didn t e mail me for three days i would be equally frustrated with e mail support
2198053 phone calls require you to stop what you re doing go to a quiet place and concentrate
2198054 what i don t get it is why a person would rather sit on the phone for however long it takes
2198055 they get a reply from me in less than 15 minutes
2198056 were doing it right and everyone else is doing it wrong
2198057 sorry but this sounds like more we re doing it right and everyone else is doing it wrong crap that you all dish out from time to time heh
2198058 phone calls require you to stop what you re doing go to a quiet place and concentrate
2198059 why are so many of the posts on this topic so mean spirited and anti 37signals
2198060 nowhere in the post do i assert such a suggestion
2198061 3 secret steps to creating the professional career you deserve
2198062 my spot on the bed is my spot in the world
2198063 pleasurable and i might go cast the people and see my characters come to life and i put the music in and i see the characters playing their scenes to the beautiful music behind them you know i get a kick out of that and if nobody else does thats too bad
2198064 when youre a kid you think to yourself fame and fortune and its going to be so exciting and but then you quickly find after three or four films you find wait a minute the upside is nothing and the downside is nothing the adulation of the multitudes or of the critics is an impersonal experience and the negative feelings from people is an impersonal experience the contract that the audience has with the person is you entertain us and well show up and that is as the contract should be
2198065 i always wanted to make the kinds of films that i saw in the 1950s the truffaut films and the goddard films and the bergmans and fellinis and those are the films that always influenced my work and ive always copied them and been influenced by them vicky christina barcelona looks to me when i see it like one of those films its got all the earmarks the music the people bicycling through europe the interaction of the characters and the out of focus scenes that you see in those pictures
2198066 barcelona is a city that i can live in very easily
2198067 if they mentioned some city in the ukraine or the sudan or something i would have said no but barcelona is a beautiful wonderful city
2198068 and when i saw her i thought my god shes if you can believe this more beautiful in person than she is on the screen i thought she was so beautiful it took my breath away
2198069 i would have given her all the furniture you know
2198070 i thought ok i have these two great tempestuous spaniards and barcelona but i dont have a film
2198071 if there are no parts for me then i just wont play any and if theres a lovable character named gramps who you know was wise beyond his years you know then
2198072 im not like dustin hoffman or robert de niro these guys go out and do miracles on the screen im a perfectly believable actor in my small range so i can play a college professor i can play a shrink i could play an intellectual even though im not an intellectual or i can play a lowlife i can play like broadway danny rose or i could play a cheesy little bookmaker or a grifter of some sort because i can handle that me the character for real is closer to the sleaze ball but i can act both of them
2198073 i always feel like i am doing the same process all the time i dont make them any differently
2198074 i dont feel any sense of liberation in europe i dont feel that i make happy films when im happy and sad films when im sad i dont feel i make autobiographical films i was not particularly happy or going through a good time of life when i made take the money and run and bananas those are two of my most silly comic films whereas when i made cassandras dream and match point i was going through a very wonderful time of life these have been very good years for me i have a great marriage great kids there is no plan or agenda to it or anything its luck its random
2198075 its a way of coping with the world you know in the same way that somebody copes with it by being a stamp collector or a sports addict or a titan of industry or an alcoholic or something my way of coping with the horrors of existence is to put my nose to the grindstone and work and not look up

2198109 i prefer to model in lightwave 3d because of the interactivity of its comprehensive modeling toolset which allows me to turn around accurate models very quickly all these shots were in imax resolution and lightwave ensured that the models would hold up and look realistic
2198110 lightwave also allowed us to build a complete model quickly while giving us the flexibility to replace as little or as much of the original plate as was needed on the fly
2198111 every day i am reminded about how versatile lightwave 3d is it is used for 300 million plus blockbusters as well as for television animated shorts ad work video game design or any other graphics project
2198112 the fact that framestore chose lightwave 3d for modeling key scenes of the dark knight which is on its way to being one of the biggest movie box office successes ever is gratifying for the newtek team
2198113 this partnership exploits the very best of high resolution scanning and aguru images texture and color capture technologies

2198123 its time to put away the arguments of political spin masters that only serve to justify abortion killing
2198124 we have all heard a great deal this year about the need for change
2198125 but at the same time we are told one thing cannot change namely the abortion regime of roe v wade it is time that we demand real change and real change means the end of roe v wade
2198126 its time to stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
2198127 this is kind of the touchstone for this whole election year id like catholics to think what real change fundamental change in a christian sense would mean
2198128 the church already respects human life but folks are not yet able to fully live this very few folks are just pro abortion in fact like kmeic they may be very pro life but support legally the concept of pro choice with limits
2198129 he casey was just the kind of person that made the whole washington democratic establishment completely uncomfortable they could never understand him
2198130 kathy leaving aside individual candidates what makes the gop or the republican administrations pro life
2198131 ironically the knights convention included a video tribute from president bush who would hardly be considered an exemplar of catholic social teaching
2198132 regrets the end of the latin mass and three years ago had gregorian chants and medieval music at his wedding
2198133 is dubious about certain important dogmas the incarnation heaven etc
2198134 jim p and robert party platforms are not indicative of anything really just convention sops to various blocs and efforts at providing cover to various voters they are irrelevant to campaigning and governing and it goes for both parties candidates and parties say things all the time do you take evrything they say at face value
2198135 in brief what has the gop done to back up their claims
2198136 the act regarded a very small number of admittedly terrible abortions but it made no pretense of ending those procedures
2198137 if we assume that there is a natural right to own property and that it is wrong to violate anothers right what constitutes stealing needs to be clearly defined by positive law and penalties for stealing have to be determined it does not necessarily follow however that every kind of infringement of the moral law should be prohibited and punished by the state for the legislator should have in view the common good and the common good is not always best sserved by legal enactments
2198138 sean id be more persuaded by your point if the gop indeed cared about the poor immigrants the elderly or advocated positions that demonstrated such care but the republican party is the ostensibly pro life party and it does not do those things how does that figure
2198139 to what organization would you refer a woman who did not want to become pregnant who was pregnant accidentally or needed prenatal care or medical or financial help caring for her children do the major pro life organizations provide these services thats not a rhetorical question i really dont know i dont believe the national right to life committee does but i could be mistaken
2198140 as for mr gibsons inquiries upthread as to what republicans have ever done re abortion id refer him to this lengthy list
2198141 the mammalian ovum wasnt discovered until the early 19th century the human egg confirmed later still
2198142 me and my mother watched it it didnt really have an affect on me because i know what i can do and what im going through
2198143 it doesnt really change my mind at all i still like penn state and im still with it
2198144 im going to have to have a serious talk with him im definitely not leaving it up to him we all need to sit down and talk about this because i just want the best for my son and i need to see what type of options he wants to have right now because penn state to me is not a good option
2198145 i kind of moved on from tech and uva when i broke my offers down to five schools
2198146 plaxo is a surrogate friendfeed but has more professional contacts in there i use friendfeed to funnel stuff into my and then there are aggregator sites where i can set up the rss feed from this blog to send stuff over automatically this is a fabulous service if and only if the site has got itself a good audience and is well managed of these marcom professional set up by philip sheldrake is my favourite it has a better range of comment and is less managed i used to check in to ragan a lot but its very us oriented and mainly aimed at pr folk which im not plus i loathe the weekly email from utalk but havent managed to unsubscribe from it maybe i dream that one day theyll pick up one of my posts to print and so how should you work out the places that your profile corporate or personal should be online my suggestion is to start with linked in because you really cant go wrong there take a look around the people you know on there and start an active campaign to connect to the ones you know if you have the energy also ask for recommendations for those youve worked for in order to find sites that may be helpful for you try this checklist go to technorati com and use a key word search that describes what your company does read the blogs it lists and sign up to read a few that seem a prolific b have good informed commentary c post regularly d score highly on the technorati authority score search google or yahoo for the same key word blog or news thatll filter out your competitors websites repeat step 2 and find those who write well sign up to read as far as the others go take a month to regularly read whats on them from people you know ask someone to let you log in to their feed pulse stream you can also ask your trusted colleagues and clients which they use and or know about and make your own mind up simon was curious about what copyright i chose to exercise on this blog i told him that i publish it all under the creative commons license dont make me think
2198147 this new treaty will mean much closer co operation and cut out much of the paperwork which has led to unnecessary delays in the current system and allowed criminals to exploit loopholes and deliberately thwart justice

2198157 calgary is a part of the worldwide olympic community and it is important for us to ensure we are building the olympic spirit whenever we can
2198158 we want to light the olympic cauldron to remind calgarians that they play a great role in providing the crucial training facilities our canadian athletes need to make it to the olympics
2198159 my hearts just racing i just have so much adrenalin right now it really brings back a lot of memories of salt lake city and torino when i was an athlete at those games
2198160 ive being doing this sport for 10 years and every time i see the olympic flag up i know its a special two week period and it really does inspire us and its going to inspire another generation of athletes coming up through the ranks
2198161 the fact theres enough leadership on the team to recognize that things need to be addressed is a positive
2198162 these guys over the years have responded and i expect them to again
2198163 if you were in orange last week would you not be embarrassed i was to have 25 points scored on you in the second half is embarrassing

2198181 well boy we have heard the charges against you of blasphemy to the twelfth degree a crime against all of humanity a crime punishable by 60 years of planetary banishment this is your only opportunity to defend yourself have you nothing to say
2198182 we just want to get some more information from you in order to understand how you came to these conclusions why dont you just start by telling us your name who you are where youre from well start from the beginning
2198183 before that i had 16 years of training in metaphysics and 12 years of apprenticeship with a time lord spiritualist in all my years of training and practice not only have i never come across such things that you speak of but i have also never even heard or read of them so forgive me if i seem a little disbelieving but how would a boy like you gain such knowledge
2198184 yea i know whats with this fishnet shirt and the neo jacket with the arms ripped off
2198185 but it doesnt have any wheels or jet packs or anything
2198186 it doesnt rise off the ground till i stand on it i guess

2198188 but you got a hoverboard and i just got some cool looking heeleys why cant i have like jetpacks or something

2198190 uh i guess the th stands for throttle but what so you have to bend down and touch both your feet in order to use your jetpacks thats dumb

2198193 this increase could be enough to push certain households into debt or further into debt but this is by no means an isolated instance todays consumers are facing substantial increases across the board from food and petrol to gas and electricity the cumulative effects can be devastating for many there may simply be no way of finding another 227 per year which works out to almost 5 per week
2198194 centrica is the second energy supplier to put its prices up we expect this sequence to continue across all suppliers forcing more than 1 million households in england into fuel poverty across the uk fuel poverty could affect 6 million households by the end of the year
2198195 with so many demands on their budget consumers are facing some tough decisions
2198196 they may feel forced to juggle their debts using credit cards or even to neglect some bills so they can pay others
2198197 as debt advisers with 15 years experience we strongly advise against either course of action
2198198 some people may be able to free up the necessary extra funds by learning to budget more effectively or by renegotiating payments to their creditors
2198199 in todays economic climate of course the kinds of debt help available may be limited as problems in todays credit market are keeping some people from accessing the debt consolidation loans that could help them regain control of their finances in cases like this an alternative debt solution may be more appropriate debt management for example relies not on access to further credit but on negotiations between an individuals creditors and the debt management professionals who ask them to accept lower monthly payments and grant other concessions as always we would recommend that anyone in financial difficulty seek professional debt advice as soon as possible
2198200 while studies suggest some of the country feel they have not yet been affected too badly by the credit crunch these people may begin to feel the effects as future events unfold
2198201 the most important thing is staying on top of your finances
2198202 make sure you are meeting all your priority financial commitments before anything else and try to build a budget around that
2198203 we would also advise people to save as much as possible because that little bit extra could come in very useful if things get tight
2198204 its important to distinguish between the different elements of the economic downturn were currently experiencing
2198205 the credit crunch primarily affects people looking for credit particularly homeowners who may be faced with large arrangement fees or higher payments when they remortgage and also those looking to obtain loans and new mortgages
2198206 people who arent reliant on credit or homeowners who have a long term fixed rate on their mortgage may well have been largely unaffected so far
2198207 but its now very possible that we will see the knock on effects of the weak housing market combined with rising costs of living higher unemployment increasing amounts of people struggling to meet their comments and more people facing problems with debt
2198208 even if it does get to that stage there are still things you can do
2198209 there are a range of debt solutions available to meet different situations including ivas individual voluntary arrangements debt consolidation loans and remortgages etc one of these could be a lifeline if you find yourself with unmanageable debt which is a growing threat in the current economic climate

2198211 maintaining personal data held is crucial as it gives a much clearer picture of each and every customer from the basics of simply having the right contact details for a customer to sophisticated segmentation which allows you to group clients into various consumer types each stage of the data cleansing process ensures that you can really understand your customer this is imperative for all companies in the credit industry whether they be debt collectors or lenders the better you know your customer the better you can manage and service them
2198212 working with a professional body such as the icm and offering such benefits is advantageous for all concerned icm members are able to sample our services at a discounted rate the icm demonstrates that it is continually working to add value to membership and we get the opportunity to showcase our services to the industry as a whole whilst our data cleansing and services are already used in the credit industry we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate our services to a wider audience

2198217 this was a concept i was discussing with eric willis a few weeks ago when the opportunity rose for media mayhem to work with nassiri
2198218 we got to thinking about the timing of the 2008 olympic games in beijing as well as a number of other pressing events around the world and we wanted to be part of something positive out there and this is media mayhems way of doing our part to raise awareness that love is blind and sees no color
2198219 we are throwing the whole ball of wax into this campaign
2198220 we will have text messaging blogging viral elements with a pass the message forward component that will give visitors the opportunity to say one thing to the world what would their message be the messages will trigger audio and video ads and pass their message to another one of the mmc sites visitors will then color the network from black and white then back to color as the messages get passed around the world
2198221 its a really brilliant concept and something that will be moving and powerful
2198222 i believe that it is important to reach out to the people in need and that is why i have decided to donate not just a portion but all of the proceeds to charity

2198224 the ongoing credit crunch and the possibility of a recession would indeed indicate that people with large debts may struggle more than most in the coming months
2198225 its more important than ever to do what you can to stop your debts growing
2198226 if you think your debts are becoming unmanageable its essential you seek professional debt advice from an expert they will be able to discuss your situation and help decide which debt solution is most suitable for you
2198227 there are a number of debt solutions for people with unmanageable debts and each are better suited to different situations speaking to an expert debt advisor will help you make the right decision and make the process as straightforward as possible

2198229 we would advise homeowners to continue saving well spending responsibly and to remain aware of the potential problems facing the housing market
2198230 the report is only speculative and as with anything it is very hard to predict what will happen in the next five years the predictions are essentially a best case scenario
2198231 in a sense its healthy to be slightly cautious when it comes to money especially with an important financial commitment like a mortgage
2198232 falling house prices means that equity tied up in the value of your home is decreasing so its wise to try and counteract that by saving money where possible
2198233 this also acts as a buffer if you find the interest on your mortgage payments going up in the next few years which is quite possible
2198234 likewise its important to keep an eye on spending and make sure unnecessary purchases are kept to a minimum avoid taking out consumer finance loans on expensive goods as they can become a big financial burden when things get tight
2198235 in fact avoiding any form of personal loans or credit is the best defence against getting into debt
2198236 many homeowners will be relatively unaffected by the problems in the housing market so long as they are willing to stay put
2198237 a loss in the value of your home only affects you if you are looking to sell but it still pays to save well in case of emergency and once the market does recover you may even find yourself in a better financial situation than you were before all the trouble started

2198246 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from former iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
2198247 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
2198248 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
2198249 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
2198250 we want this question to go away so were going to call it ridiculous
2198251 in late september tenet returned from a meeting at the white house with instructions for cia
2198252 well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
2198253 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
2198254 even five years later richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
2198255 took him aside and briefed him on the iraq operations groups next assignment the habbush letter
2198256 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible maguire recalls
2198257 what would have happened yesterday thats what i dont understand richers retired from the cia
2198258 but also hes a government contractor he runs an intelligence firm that lives on government contracts by and large
2198259 so you still stand by everything and say that perhaps these two guys were pressured
2198260 you know in this situation you know you can almost expect that they would be pressured you know its the testimony of a few people with so very much at stake well see how it unfolds
2198261 never says that maguire was in the chain of command it says in fact that rob talked to john maguire about it but maguire was going back to baghdad so his successor handled it
2198262 character assassination is what they do when they have nothing else to say
2198263 in a new book journalist ron suskind claims he has new evidence to show the case was more than a failure of intelligence it was he writes an out and out deception
2198264 the bush administration joined former top cia officials in denouncing a new books assertion that white house officials ordered the forgery of iraqi documents to suggest a link between iraqi president saddam hussein and the lead hijacker in the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks
2198265 two former cia officers tuesday denied that they or the spy agency faked an iraqi intelligence document purporting to link saddam hussein with 9 11 bomber mohammed atta as they are quoted as saying in a new book
2198266 the white house issued the statement on behalf of the former officials after a day of adamant denials from the cia and bush administration about the claim made in the way of the world a book by washington based journalist ron suskind
2198267 so who do you believe ron suskind who says that everything in the book is on the record many sources or the bush white house which is assailing suskind for
2198268 suskind who won a pulitzer while writing for the wall street journal has been watchdogging this white house ever since he worked with ex treasury department secretary paul oneill on the latters tell all book and the administration has never been able to wreck his reputation
2198269 a disdain for contemplation or deliberation an embrace of decisiveness a retreat from empiricism a sometimes bullying impatience with doubters and even friendly questioners
2198270 on the other end of the believability scale we of course have a white house long practiced in the art of deception
2198271 tony fratto a bush deputy press secretary uttered the standard denial about suskind yesterday
2198272 even if one is inclined to doubt the notion that the bush war team would actually fake a document in the service of better propaganda suskinds broader theme has long rung true that bush has spent much of the last seven years seeking only the kind of evidence that would square with his certitudes
2198273 when this came up on msnbc moderator chuck todd asked politicos mike allen whether this would lead the anti war crowd in congress to call for impeachment allen replied that it would give the lefty blogosphere something to grab onto
2198274 and so in less time than it takes to say dick cheney the subject is changed from what would be one of the most outrageous violations of the constitution in the history of the republic to a left right issue
2198275 if the white house asked the cia to cook up this disinformation aimed at the american people why shouldnt the righty blogosphere too be up in arms why doesnt every american regardless of political party have a stake in the truth and the rule of law
2198276 i know i know thats not chuck todds or mike allens jobs unfortunately the closest that the msm usually comes to weighing the evidence is saying ron suskind charges x and the white house denies it this is what is now called reporting
2198277 any such notion that we would engage in that kind of activity is just absurd
2198278 we this white house it is absurd to suggest that this white house would seek to punish someone for speaking out with a different view we welcome people with different views thats a healthy part of our democracy
2198279 ive made it very clear that it was a ridiculous suggestion in the first place
2198280 the extraordinary transfer of wealth that took place between ordinary households and the extremely well to do and the effort by this administration to address the consequences of that problem without addressing the root cause
2198281 economy did in fact grow at a reasonably strong pace through most of the bush presidency
2198282 drained the american consumer of the resources needed to keep the economy humming
2198283 the percentage by which the effective tax rate was cut for high income families was nearly twice the rate cut for those in the middle of the income spectrum
2198284 those among the top 10 percent of all households on average increased their income by about 2 percent while those in the bottom 90 percent u s corporations
2198285 at a little less than two thirds the growth rate of the gross domestic product
2198286 corporate profits grew nearly four times as fast as gdp
2198287 which accounted for 95 3 percent of the nations income growth between 2002 and 2006
2198288 the interest rate charged by the federal reserve to member institutions reduction in the cost of money to member banks began a frenzy of economic activity
2198289 extremely low interest rates made it possible for hard pressed consumers to maintain and even improve their living standards by taking equity out of their homes
2198290 the dramatic expansion of credit created excessive debt and distorted the price of housing it also
2198291 which certainly doesnt raise hopes of the number of people in debt decreasing anytime soon
2198292 as things stand we would expect the number of people experiencing debt problems to increase fairly significantly due to a combination of the credit crunch rapidly growing costs of living and rising unemployment
2198293 these things take a while to filter through to the wider economy
2198294 this in turn could lead to increasing numbers of people who can no longer manage their debts and its essential that these people get expert help as early as possible
2198295 an iva can be a great help to people with over 15 000 of debt
2198296 it allows a significant portion of their debts to be repaid in convenient monthly payments usually for five years after which the remaining debt is written off
2198297 there is something of a stigma surrounding bankruptcy but in the right circumstances it may be the best possible way of making a fresh start
2198298 people who go through bankruptcy are subject to some restrictions for example they are highly unlikely to be able to borrow any more money for a number of years and they will most probably be forced to sell any valuable assets they own but once the bankruptcy process is complete they will be legally debt free and able to get on with their lives

2198336 restricted edwards from performing work for andersens los angeles clients and therefore restricted his ability to practice his accounting profession
2198337 it comes from the fact that i am not very tall and people always said that i would never make it as a player because i was too small
2198338 so every time i score a nice goal i make the gesture which increases my height
2198339 there were a lot of people who thought i wouldnt make it as a professional footballer because of my size the media wrote it in the newspapers although some coaches never said it to me directly i think they thought it too
2198340 i have always had confidence in my own ability and now im just eager to prove people wrong i want to show those who did not believe in me that they were mistaken thats a big motivating factor for me
2198341 i didnt expect it the standing ovation from the fans so i was surprised and very very happy and very proud
2198342 it was a very emotional day given the goal my performance and the standing ovation
2198343 i was a little bit surprised with what the coach of honduras said about me but also very grateful however i dont like to make comparisons with other great players i just want to be myself but it is true that when i was a child i looked up to the great no10s

2198348 its fresh its new and its an excellent adaptive reuse of the building hes maintaining the architectural integrity of the building and hes expanding it tying the former sanctuary building and the furniture store together
2198349 i can unveil this thing and everyone can say its the best in the world but i cant go forward if there isnt interest
2198350 that being said i dont see how it wont get interest its a pretty spectacular corner

2198352 it was not a great performance but credit to south mancs who have a great squad
2198353 there has been a major downturn we expected one in around six months but were affected almost immediately
2198354 im surprised at how quickly the crunch took effect not only are people giving less but some are not giving at all
2198355 we went from a record appeal the year before to the worst in 10 years
2198356 the scheme was to sell for a profit in order to afford more housing we wont be doing any properties for sale now i have been running the association for 21 years and this is the most difficult time since the last housing crisis of 1989 to 1992
2198357 the contradiction of it all is that more people need affordable housing now so the demands are double but they are harder to meet
2198358 on a more positive note we are delighted to report that the number of our donors is still strong which reflects our robust supporter base within the community
2198359 the cost of meat has risen by nearly 20 per cent we are more and more dependent on the goodwill of the community but people are less able to support us middle class donors are unable to donate as they did so we are constantly trying to find ways to bridge the gap
2198360 residents fees are set a year in advance but the increase in our costs has been steep we are now looking at all our outgoings to see if we can make any savings but are not compromising on quality
2198361 at the moment we are able to meet our costs as we have 99 9 per cent occupancy it would be more concerning if we had voids
2198362 we cannot allow the residents to suffer in any way so we just have to absorb these increases
2198363 most of wjrs work involves supporting jewish communities in the former soviet union and eastern europe and our work in these regions is affected by the weak dollar and rising inflation
2198364 in terms of helping more jews get out of poverty and helping to rebuild their communities i am not as optimistic as i was two years ago we are working a lot harder to stay where we are but the person at the end of the line is getting less
2198365 either we have to give more people less or fewer people the same you go to your donors to raise 500 000 for a community centre by the time youve raised the money it has gone up to 750 000 but you cant go back to people to say can we have some more please we are constantly having to make some tough judgment calls
2198366 we like any other organisation are feeling the pinch and are doing all we can to minimise our operating costs
2198367 many large donors will have been affected by the slowdown in the property industry and our small donors will be seeing increases in their household bills
2198368 in addition we are having to fight for every penny from the local authorities who purchase our services in order to secure fees that we believe are fair
2198369 we cant necessarily reveal the reasons our clients come to us it could be a result of better advertising and new staff but there is a rise in clients
2198370 funding from government and local authorities is becoming increasingly restricted making a difficult time even harder we are fully aware that we and our community will face difficult decisions as the economic climate worsens so we will do all we can to make sure that the services we offer are effectively and efficiently run
2198371 it looks as if our annual appeal might be a bit down on last year and the value of our investments has gone down the cost of us supporting people has also increased as have transport costs but we dont rely on donations as most of our funding comes from legacies and on properties donated and which we rent to jewish people in need at a subsidised rate
2198372 but the two events were both down about 10 per cent on the amount they have yielded in past years
2198373 increasingly people are living longer with cancer so we are keeping our clients longer if donations are going down and we need to raise more than we did last year we have a real challenge on our hands
2198374 we have felt the effects of increasing fuel food and transport costs but in terms of donations we have not been affected as yet we are concerned but at the moment we are not having to scale back any of our services we might have to do so in the future so we are studying things to make sure we are getting the best deals we can on everything
2198375 the trend is for income to be increasing this year we hope to be able to consolidate the increases we made last year if not even exceed last years total looking at the campaign as a whole we are not seeing any specific impact of the economic crunch
2198376 next year we want to present the community with another ambitious programme of activities our costs are now 12 5 per cent of turnover and we have made significant progress in reducing them we are involved in the jewish leadership council scheme to share resources and cut costs its value is something that we need to recognise now more than ever
2198377 last year donors gave us marvellous support even though there was no emergency raising more than 6 million
2198378 i cant see doing that this year its not that they havent got the money its the feeling that things are not so good we have found that people may be giving a little less but theres nothing in it what worries me is what will happen next year more than this
2198379 do you miss me or do you just miss fucking me having a bit of a horny moment are we

2198634 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that that was the studios idea
2198635 and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
2198636 i could sell them the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it
2198637 and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off
2198638 im real lucky because my daughter has cameron definitely loves the sex machines right now she cant get enough of this sybian sex machine she climbs on to it at least once or twice a day orgasming at least once every time its been like thi

2198674 these are the first gdp figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2198675 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavorable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone

2198677 bad news in europe is good news for the dollar and bearish for commodities
2198678 the markets are more focused on the dollar and its newfound strength oil is less looking at geopolitical risk and slowing demand risk

2198694 sab a que iba a encontrar un congreso de alto nivel porque la antropolog a argentina se ha desarrollado mucho en los ltimos 20 a os gracias al esfuerzo de los colegas de la universidad de misiones que cuentan con un postgrado de alta calidad el cual contribuy al crecimiento de esta disciplina en el pa s
2198695 con esta cuesti n quise mostrar que hoy d a existe un consenso sobre la noci n de diversidad cultural algo que todos quieren y la aceptan como un valor central de la vida pol tica y social pero que es una cuesti n para pensarla
2198696 lo que estoy diciendo con esto contin o el investigador es que la diversidad cultural est por transformarse en una especie de universal pero que en tiempo de globalizaci n como el que vivimos los universales son m s un campo de disputa pol tica que otra cosa
2198697 hay que llamar a asamblea de esta conducci n pol tica no creo que surja una soluci n si todos los que tenemos mandato popular debemos ponerlo a disposici n que nos vayamos todos que pongamos punto final rectores decanos consejeros para recuperar la confianza
2198698 el rector no tiene poder y depender exclusivamente de su agrupaci n para sostenerse
2198699 la universidad pr cticamente est en bancarrota le est faltando dinero para poder solventar los sueldos y ese dinero en buenos aires significa tener las puertas abiertas
2198700 la nica salida es presentar una nueva cara que otras personas se pongan al frente de la universidad
2198701 hay que cumplir el mandato pero abrir el juego y buscar consenso que se genere una propuesta cre ble
2198702 es preocupante en realidad se habla muy poco en la universidad de este tema la crisis institucional somos pocos los docentes que ponemos el tema en las aulas y lo conversamos con los alumnos y lo profundizamos
2198703 la obra p blica se ha constituido en la principal herramienta del gobierno para generar desarrollo econ mico en la provincia con destino social y para generar un desarrollo equilibrado y equitativo en los 75 municipios

2198707 en el caso de nuestra representaci n pol tica est acompa ada por otras acciones que hemos tomado en la misma direcci n para dinamizar este sector tan importante en la econom a y en la historia de misiones el sector de la yerba mate
2198708 misiones aporta a la econom a yerbatera entre el 90 y 95 por ciento y dos provincias son todo el problema por qu los misioneros no hacemos punta con una discusi n primero en profundidad y por qu no sembramos los primeros v nculos de la soberan a yerbatera de la provincia y lo resolvemos aqu si ac se comercializa ac se produce ac est el problema es tiempo de empezar a pensar y de proponer en el parlamento misionero y luego para nuestro territorio provincial un instituto o una delegaci n que vaya haci ndose cargo pero con todas las indicaciones no solamente recomendando sino completando la tarea que lleva adelante nuestro ministerio del agro y la producci n y la tarea que lleva adelante nuestro gobernador de hacer cumplir la ley y tambi n nuestros representantes que son minor as en ese directorio
2198709 por esta discusi n tan seria de defender a nuestros tareferos y terminar por un planteo de fondo pero ya creo que hay un paso intermedio y dejo picando la inquietud de elaborarla en conjunto como hemos este proyecto
2198710 esa plata que produce el estampillado misionero por una ley provincial la obliguemos a gastar en lo que indiquemos los misioneros y le llevemos las pautas al directorio

2198722 is to encourage him to see and feel what he is doing that is to increase his awareness of what actually is

2198725 what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2198726 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
2198727 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis

2198735 while rbs does face the threat of further writedowns and or a uk recession our view is that the company has taken a conservative stance on writedowns and has the benefit of diversification away from the uk
2198736 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
2198737 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market writedowns
2198738 these are the first gdp figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in europe
2198739 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavourable situation than germany or france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2198740 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent
2198741 a full fledged adjustment phase has begun for the euro
2198742 players who have been bullish on the euro are now unwinding long buy positions

2198744 for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but in order that the world might be saved through him

2198756 wenn auf dem balkan oder im kaukasus was los ist schnell bei zbigniew brzezinski nachlesen was wohl dahintersteckt und wie es vermutlich weitergehen wird
2198757 anders als in armenien oder aserbaidschan mit ihrer ethnisch recht homogenen bev lkerung geh ren etwa 30 der 6 millionen georgier ethnischen minderheiten an berdies hegen diese kleinen volksgruppen die in ihrer organisationsform und ihrem selbstverst ndnis eher st mmen gleichen groll gegen die georgische herrschaft nach der aufl sung der sowjetunion machten sich daher die osseten und die abchasen den innergeorgischen machtkampf zunutze um sich von georgien abzuspalten dies geschah mit stillschweigender r ckendeckung russlands das georgien zum verbleib in der gus aus der sich georgien anfangs g nzlich zur ckziehen wollte und zur duldung russischer milit rbasen auf seinem territorium zwingen wollte um das gebiet von der t rkei abzuriegeln
2198758 der umstand dass zwei der gr eren angrenzenden nationalstaaten t rkei und der iran jeder mit einem historisch gewachsenen imperialen kulturellen religi sen und konomischen interesse in der region in ihrer geopolitischen orientierung unberechenbar sind und zudem selbst mit internen problemen zu schaffen haben verst rkt die instabilit t des eurasischen balkan gravierend und macht die lage noch explosiver
2198759 auch die r ckendeckung die die ukraine den nach gr erer unabh ngigkeit strebenden staaten gibt verfolgt den zweck die eigene unabh ngigkeit gegen ber moskau zu st rken so hat die ukraine die anstrengungen georgiens unterst tzt aserische lexporte ber sein gebiet zu leiten dar ber hinaus tat sie sich mit der t rkei zusammen um den russischen einflu im schwarzen meer zu schw chen und unterst tzte die t rkischen bem hungen erd l von zentralasien in t rkische terminals zu leiten
2198760 au enpolitisch w nschen sich georgien und armenien obwohl letzteres von russischer unterst tzung gegen aserbaidschan abh ngig ist eine zunehmend engere anbindung an europa
2198761 ermutigt durch die t rkei und die usa hat aserbaidschan nicht nur die forderungen russlands zur ckgewiesen auf seinem boden milit rbasen zu errichten sondern sich auch dem ansinnen moskaus widersetzt da alles l von baku zu einem russischen schwarzmeerhafen geleitet werden sollte stattdessen entschied es sich f r eine doppell sung die eine zweite durch georgien zur t rkei verlaufende lleitung vorsieht
2198762 amerikas prim res interesse mu folglich sein mit daf r zu sorgen da keine einzelne macht die kontrolle ber dieses gebiet erlangt und die weltgemeinschaft ungehinderten finanziellen und wirtschaftlichen zugang zu ihr hat
2198763 die staaten die amerikas st rkste geopolitische unterst tzung verdienen sind aserbaidschan usbekistan und die ukraine da alle drei geopolitische dreh und angelpunkte darstellen
2198764 in dieser region hat amerika ein gemeinsames interesse nicht nur mit einer stabilen prowestlichen t rkei sondern auch mit dem iran und mit china eine allm hliche verbesserung in den amerikanisch iranischen beziehungen w rde den globalen zugang zur region erheblich erweitern und insbesondere die unmittelbare bedrohung abwenden der aserbaidschans berleben ausgesetzt ist
2198765 ausschlaggebend f r die zukunft der kaukasusrepubliken d rfte die weitere entwicklung und politische orientierung der t rkei sein wenn sie ihren kurs auf europa beibeh lt und wenn europa ihr nicht die t ren zuschl gt werden die kaukasusstaaten vermutlich in den einflu bereich europas streben eine aussicht die sie gl hend herbeisehnen aber wenn die europ isierung der t rkei aus innenpolitischen oder u eren gr nden ins stocken ger t dann wird georgien und armenien keine andere wahl bleiben als sich russlands willen anzupassen

2198769 the ak 47 or kalashnikov its the worlds most popular assault rifle a weapon all fighters love an elegantly simple 9 pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood it doesnt break jam or overheat itll shoot whether its covered in mud or filled with sand its so easy even a child can use it and they do
2198770 but i thought that the female toilets would be on the same side as the male toilets
2198771 but dont normal people look around to the other side after they dont find the toilet at first
2198772 its just memories in the pictures that you cant get back all you can do is now remember it
2198773 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2198774 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2198775 the references quoted in his article are not a fair representation of the body of scientific evidence available to us and when mixed with selectivity and conjecture they cannot be relied on to form concrete opinion
2198776 we spend a lot of our time trying to convince habitual sun worshippers to cover up when we remove their multiple basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas if we are now to tell them that ultraviolet light may protect against some forms of cancer including melanoma i will go and get my hat
2198777 the evidence linking major cancers including breast prostate pancreas and colon to uvb light under exposure is actually rather stronger than is the evidence linking melanoma quantitatively responsible for an order of magnitude fewer deaths to uvb over exposure this debate highlights how the more we as specialty doctors diverge from the common stem of general internal medicine that nurtured us the greater the risk of our missing the bigger picture when an issue transcends specialty boundaries
2198778 doctors need to be open and honest with their patients and if called on to do so the general public
2198779 because i have to work tomorrow you should get some rest
2198780 actually thats what i wanted to talk to you about have you seen sayu recently
2198781 i will just answer me one question though do you love her
2198782 i wont tell sayu about this ill let you do it
2198783 its great to hear from you again we have to do something sometime
2198784 ive been living in an incredible state of pressure and scrutiny
2198785 what matters to me though is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2198786 the judge did what he thought was right we dont agree
2198787 jag tycker att det r b de synd och skam att man nekar ungdomar att campa om inte alla r ver 25 r det finns faktiskt ungdomar som r sk tsammare n vuxna kan man inte sk ta sig p en camping blir man naturligtvis avvisad d rifr n men man ska inte ha f rutfattade meningar
2198788 the hair things weird because a lot of people ask if it was for t scc or for the movie i did over the break where i had to shave my head and shave my eyebrows off and everything
2198789 weve always from day one wanted to have the long hair and then cut it off as another way of stripping away his identity but it was for the movie originally
2198790 i purposely wanted to play the role in the first season very weak and hiding behind his hair and like a little kid
2198791 we did that on purpose even though we knew it would kind of frustrate a lot of people who wanted to see this savior who were asking where is he to then in the second season where he goes through this huge thing that i cant disclose a bunch of things at the very beginning of the season that change him
2198792 i fight people i shoot people i wasnt doing it all last year
2198793 after the explosion cameron does get damaged and shes more unpredictable than ever
2198794 john already had issues with having someone with him all of the time trying to protect him and now he meets a new girl and he pulls away from cameron so thats something that camerons really struggling with i think shes really struggling with jealousy in a way that a robot cant really feel jealous but her whole purpose in life is to protect john and when john takes that away from her shes lost
2198795 we really want to stay true to what a terminator is and what they should be but when i took the role i really had a feeling that we were going to go further than any terminator has before and i think that thats one of joshs goals
2198796 im so excited about it i wish i could say things about it but its probably the most exciting acting ive ever done
2198797 i read it in a starbucks and at one point yelled so loud in shock and the whole place looked at me like i was a nutcase it was kind of funny
2198798 i think one thing that we revealed at the panel that was quite shocking to the panel was that one of the people on the panel was going to die this season and then since they dont know which one it was a little unnerving for them and they seemed distracted for the rest of the day
2198799 you could narrow it down a little bit but why do that lena literally was like ill show up on time i promise
2198800 ironically we were given more money this year than we had last year so we decided that we needed to make an even bigger show than we made last year its quite challenging were doing a lot more days on location bigger stunts and car chases stuff like that we did some of last year but there were certainly episodes that were smaller and this year there are episodes that are quite large its interesting
2198801 kevin reilly and crew were not there when the firefly thing went down
2198802 what i like about fox is that they are a more disruptive network in terms of their taste they will do things in order to make noise
2198803 a lot of the other networks they want people to watch their show but maybe theyre a little more polite about it and i think fox will embrace the things that we need to have on our show
2198804 im not a big fan of standalone storytelling i think the best science fiction is inherently serialized and i am a serialized storyteller its what i like i really only want to be doing serialized television
2198805 i think that what we found last year is that there were people that were trying to access the show some episodes in and they were frustrated by that i felt like i was trying to tell some very complicated stories and do a very seralized version of those complicated stories and i wasnt allowing for any standalone elements there were very few access points for people if they missed a few episodes
2198806 i would love for somebody to be able to jump in on episode 2 or 3 and at least have an experience where they understood 70 percent of it its never going to be csi or law amp order its always going to be seralized its a saga and itll never not be serialized it will never be terminator of the week
2198807 there is something that happens in the first couple of episodes where they discover something that allows them to have a particular engine to go on missions so that there are missions but theyre also sort of tied in to the larger mythology there is a little teaser in the season 2 preview clip that if you saw something and froze it that perhaps it would indicate how they might go on missions and have standalone episodes but its going to go i get bored
2198808 hes got a tougher haircut for example i hated thomass hair last year he used to come to me on the set and id be looking at him and all id be doing is looking up at his hair and he was like you hate my hair and i go yeah i do lets shave it off we couldnt because we were shooting a lot of episodes out of order so we were stuck in this weird continuity loop so i couldnt change his look because we were shooting episode 4 but it was airing episode 8 or whatever it was a mess but we always talked about it and then this year i had an idea for the first episode that involved some significant changes between john and sarah and that sort of propelled them forward and then as it happened he did a movie within the break where he had to shave his head
2198809 thomas is one of the smartest actors i know and hes very very brave and hes very aware of the franchise
2198810 part of what thomas and i have talked about is that john is getting kind of tougher and hes coming into his own but it doesnt necessarily mean hes becoming more mature all the time he can make a lot of poor choices and i think that hes still a kid
2198811 theres one episode weve already shot thats entirely a derek and john episode in terms of the big story and you get to see a lot of the contrasts in terms of how they approach things hes not where he needs to be yet and he hasnt seen what derek has seen so i think that theres still a lot of interplay that still needs to take place
2198812 in a mother son relationship theres always another woman involved
2198813 last year that other woman was cameron this character riley serves that purpose i also think that shell serve the purpose in challenging the bonds that are between john and cameron
2198814 in the way that she thinks its not in the best interest of the future that john be away from her then yeah absolutely
2198815 one of the big things ive done with sarah is take john away from her sort of as a dependable son i think that last year that character could really take for granted his love and his approval and i think one of the things when youre writing these things is that you want to try to find challenges for the character what is the most valuable thing to her well john connor is the most valuable thing to her hes not going to die but that doesnt mean their relationship cant die no one has ever said in the franchise that at the end of the day they didnt go separate ways strategically you have to examine it and you have to try to find things to do with the relationship because thats the stuff that im interested in so you have to challenge it lena as an actress loves to run around and kick ass put a gun in her hands and let her get punched or punch somebody and shes the happiest girl around but she also really loves the real nitty gritty emotional stuff she really loves digging into that kind of stuff and i think shes so good at it and shes so intense
2198816 i dont feel the pressure because im ignorant i guess
2198817 i hope that the two of them actually help each other theres no problem
2198818 friedman also revealed that there will be more self contained episodes in the upcoming season
2198819 if we learned anything last year sometimes the show got overly complicated there were heavy mythology episode and serialized and were trying this year to tell i dont want to say less complicated but maybe slightly less ambitious stories
2198820 both the show and the movie take certain inspirations from the terminator mythology and certain themes are important like the value of sacrifice perseverance and faith
2198821 what we did in the pilot is put them in the present day so there is a new timeline and can only be seen on this show
2198822 the show is about the family and everything that concerns the family concerns us last year john was still in denial and didnt want the problems of being a hero this season will be his coming of age year john will grow up and what will be interesting is that as the boy grows into a man the less hell needs his mother sara s ex will also be back as will agent ellison and i think its fair to say that agent ellison has seen some things that will make him re consider everything hes known before
2198823 the show is about the family and everything that concerns the family concerns us last year john was still in denial and didnt want the problems of being a hero this season will be his coming of age year john will grow up and what will be interesting is that as the boy grows into a man the less hell needs his mother sara s ex will also be back as will agent ellison and i think its fair to say that agent ellison has seen some things that will make him re consider everything hes known before
2198824 the show is about the family and everything that concerns the family concerns us last year john was still in denial and didnt want the problems of being a hero this season will be his coming of age year john will grow up and what will be interesting is that as the boy grows into a man the less hell needs his mother sara s ex will also be back as will agent ellison and i think its fair to say that agent ellison has seen some things that will make him re consider everything hes known before
2198825 at least three commentaries out of the nine episodes including a pilot commentary one on the finale one on the future episode so we did a bunch of those there are some mini docs weve got some good stuff i think its gonna be really cool we had summer glau thomas dekker lena headey director david nutter james middleton and some of the other writers and brian austin green also we all did commentaries so theres some good stuff on it i like it
2198826 the show is about the family and everything that concerns the family concerns us last year john was still in denial and didnt want the problems of being a hero this season will be his coming of age year john will grow up and what will be interesting is that as the boy grows into a man the less hell needs his mother sara s ex will also be back as will agent ellison and i think its fair to say that agent ellison has seen some things that will make him re consider everything hes known before
2198827 consulting producer james middleton says august we did do a bunch of extras for the dvd theres at least three commentaries out of the nine episodes including a pilot commentary one on the finale one on the future episode so we did a bunch of those there are some mini docs weve got some good stuff i think its gonna be really cool we had summer glau thomas dekker lena headey director david nutter james middleton and some of the other writers and brian austin green also we all did commentaries so theres some good stuff on it i like it
2198828 theyre really the lead candidates at this point weve already started staffing on sarah connor although it was an unusual season it will end up finishing by far and away the strongest new drama of the season
2198829 currently a lock to win the season foxs january launched
2198830 to me its about sarah and the big thing about terminator 3 is sarah is not in it terminator 3 for our timeline doesnt exist now lets go forward the terminator franchise is the ultimate timeline one is a tv timeline ones a movie time line track them both and see where we end up
2198831 ill just say every interesting relationship ive been in was a triangle
2198832 that sounds good he in not a main character and not really needed in the plot i could see him coming back to help john without sarahs knowledge
2198833 well i love me its the only kind of love that makes sense

2198884 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2198885 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2198886 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2198887 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2198888 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2198889 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2198890 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2198891 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2198892 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2198898 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2198899 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2198900 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2198901 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2198902 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2198903 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2198904 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2198905 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2198906 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2198907 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2198908 the funky systems got to fall or its gotta be changed to include us all
2198909 they took my simple song they changed the words and the melody made it all sound wrong now it all sounds like a symphony
2198910 i dont care if it makes the charts yall i only wrote it for you and me
2198911 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2198912 a solution should be found regarding the palestinian right to return
2198913 lebanon must not lose any sources of strength in face of israel
2198914 which the lebanese agree to and subscribe to by assuming its burdens and benefiting from its outcomes
2198915 israel will not acquiesce to the continued smuggling of arms

2198919 nearly six years after the conclusion of joint task force 2s mission with the combined joint special operations task force south cjsotf south of the united states military the government of canada has authorised the acceptance of a presidential unit citations for canadas elite special operations unit
2198920 such gallantry determination and esprit de corps in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions to have set it apart from and above other units participating in the same campaign
2198921 fort rucker ala the first canadians slated to fly helicopter combat missions in afghanistan have been secretly training for duty since last march at an army base in alabama we are going to save a lot of lives and directly affect combat operations said lieutenant colonel roger gagnon of hawkesbury ont
2198922 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2198923 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2198924 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2198925 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2198926 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2198927 at this juncture in the infowar discussions of religion a dozen christian sects squabbling
2198928 i do not undertake to promote welfare for i propose to extend freedom my aim is not to pass laws but to repeal them it is not to inaugurate new programs but to cancel old ones that do violence to the constitution
2198929 if your anger and outrage are not at the forefront then youre already dead

2198931 the right of civilians in a free society to possess
2198932 i knew from being around my father that not everyone means me well
2198933 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2198934 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2198935 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2198936 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2198937 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2198938 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2198939 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2198940 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2198941 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2198942 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2198943 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2198944 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2198945 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2198946 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2198947 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2198948 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2198949 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2198950 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2198951 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2198952 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2198953 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2198954 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2198955 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2198956 who are open to doing something on the production side
2198957 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2198958 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2198959 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2198960 when you look at a painting how do you know absolutely that there was a painter
2198961 no security system is perfect just as a drivers license is never fool proof
2198962 predators they groom and so develop these relationships over a long period of time and theyre grooming multiple children at a time
2198963 social networking sites allow them to do this very easily
2198964 what isnt said is that most sexual predators have never been arrested or convicted so most sexual predator wont be blocked by that lack of technology to filter
2198965 one of the worst things that parents do is set up an oppositional environment
2198966 parental control is such a negative phrase no kid wants to be controlled
2198967 if instead you say lets have a collaborative environment this is why were doing this because you dont want to be ripped off hurt scammed or put our home at risk of being robbed then you can start having a collaborative experience that can help teach things
2198968 you do not have to be some kind of tech spert in order to help your kids be safe online
2198969 on myspace in particular when a child sets their site to be private their photo still displays their name still displays their location their age and any quote they have still displays
2198970 with all that information its not private myspace has intentionally exposed them with considerable risk
2198971 led by pastor fred phelps the westboro baptist church from kansas issued a release saying they would picket mcleans funeral this weekend
2198972 be careful driving home i mean in your condition and all
2198973 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2198974 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2198975 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2198976 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2198977 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2198978 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2198979 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2198980 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2198981 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2198982 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2198983 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2198984 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2198985 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2198986 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2198987 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2198988 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2198989 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2198990 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2198991 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2198992 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2198993 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2198994 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2198995 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2198996 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2198997 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2198998 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2198999 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2199000 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2199001 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2199002 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2199003 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2199004 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

2199006 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2199007 ive been bombarded with emails from people claiming that mr comfort is stating that dr myers chickened out of the debate this is just not true we ben jim and myself made a decision monday afternoon that due to the call in nature of our show it would work better to have two separate segments i can only guess that some of the emails we sent to you were lost as monday is when our server problems started i am assuming that the email containing the information on the change in format from a debate to two separate interviews was never received by you for this i apologize as it has caused much confusion on the internet regarding the interviews with mr comfort and dr myers
2199008 thank you very much for your kind explanation the first communication i received that the debate was off was ten minutes before i was due to go on air and therefore wondered if dr myers had chickened out i have had that happen with atheists my apologies to you and to him for the misunderstanding i am in the very enviable position of having a mass of atheists follow me around and for some reason they have a habit of embellishing my words still i am honored that so many read my daily blog and welcome more thanks again for having me on your program best wishes ray
2199009 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2199010 if employees get a satisfactory rating on their performance appraisal depending again on what labor agreement you work under youre gonna get a step increase
2199011 odd as it seems 2008 being a leap year had an extra day in there
2199012 so if you had a salary thats pretty much frozen from year to year the amount of money it takes to pay you from one year to the next may go down slightly
2199013 it just would not be fair to our employees not to provide some sort of increase
2199014 these people have families and everything they do costs more
2199015 we had to stay within the parameters that were set down with the city manager for any kind of property tax mill levy increase and thats what we can afford
2199016 i have to decide now whether or not to pay for my prescriptions or pay my utility bill
2199017 i set the thermostat to a certain temperature which i thought 68 to 70 was good
2199018 maybe shes not comfortable with it being that low but i recommend she try to use a ceiling fan or portable fan as much as she can
2199019 thats why our customer service is there to walk her through
2199020 we can apologize to her and we can sit down and do that
2199021 its a horrible feeling when you realized you made a mistake
2199022 i saw quite a few of them that were very close
2199023 it reminds me of the snafu they had back in florida having to count all the chads and everything
2199024 i just have to get the correct numbers out there thats my job and how that affects the races well everybody has to live with results one way or another
2199025 instead it was accidentally intended for the results coming back from the precincts on the optical scan machine
2199026 because it had results in that column it did not allow the results to upload from the precincts and thats a safety feature
2199027 i apologize certainly to everybody who was concerned about this race and thats an awful lot of people
2199028 we have made it very clear that they would have to have made substantial progress on a verification protocol and that when the day passes august 11 we will take another look at all that information and decide how to act and when
2199029 i think we have made it very clear to them that that deadline is really not a deadline but a minimum amount of time that we have to begin making our decisions
2199030 so weve been working off a cell phone for half the day
2199031 they let me know that there was a problem here in town so we just had one of the lines transferred to the agents cell phone
2199032 oh my were a very busy office we probably get i would say 50 to 100 calls a day to one cell phone so theyve spent the rest of the day playing catch up

2199041 you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
2199042 i think a lot of people assume a lot of things about why square made that announcement
2199043 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us
2199044 so i think people make a lot of assumptions about what they read or the rumours that go around but the reality of a lot of this is that were doing very well we have a great install base we have passionate gamers like you guys that buy a lot of games and a publisher like square cant ignore that

2199068 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2199069 some of whom had expressed concern about the new contract provisions relative to paid holidays
2199070 in an effort to be responsive tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue and the union agreed to do so
2199071 this means that in 2008 only shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays
2199072 will have the option of selecting another day as a paid personal day at their discretion
2199073 the amended contract will be extended throughout the life of the current labor agreement and will recognize the following eight 8 paid holidays new years day martin luther king jr
2199074 the union is pleased that the will of the workers in shelbyville to observe and celebrate eid al fitr will be guaranteed as a paid holiday
2199075 the rwdsu believes that this is an important sign of respect of deeply held religious beliefs this labor day the workers at shelbyville have more reason than ever to be proud of being part of a union
2199076 this is not the image we want from tyson foods
2199077 for over a hundred years labor day has stood as a symbol to honor the working men and women of this country but for the past few years traditions like labor day have been under attack this time its gone too far and we as patriotic americans must draw our line in the sand
2199078 but in america we do not need to allow substitutions and exceptions to our beloved heritage
2199079 and have asked them to reconsider their contract actions and work to restore americas image as a nation built on noble traditions
2199080 we must stand up for working people of shelbyville bedford county and all tennesseans stand up to defend our heritage rights and privileges in celebrating the american worker for all that they have done to make this country great
2199081 my impression was when i read it in the paper they should have that day labor day and if they want to take off that other day eid al fitr that should be up to the company
2199082 but i didnt think it was a good thing to do as a business
2199083 i think tyson needs to go back and reconsider this
2199084 they need to sit down and renegotiate this they had honorable intentions to try to do something for the plant but its a mistake
2199085 most of them think that when people come to america they should do as americans do instead of americans changing and adapting things the way they do in language traditions and all of that
2199086 get along with people how to work with people and how to be kind to one another
2199087 not them the refugees so much but the way they are used to operating in their country which is more aggressive than most people that come here
2199088 their custom is to negotiate everything but here you go into stores you dont negotiate you make your mind up if you want to pay for it or not
2199089 theyre here they are part of the community they are part of the economy so its not like you can just tell them to leave but tyson is the reason why they are here they are attracted by them they come from different places to work here
2199090 tysons got a big stake in this to help the community to orientate the people somalis to be kind to be nice to be polite
2199091 i understand that they can come across as rude and unfriendly but is treating them with such hatred going to make them want to adapt to our country
2199092 in a statement by tyson spokesperson libby lawson the food processing giant made this request on behalf of its shelbyville plant employees
2199093 the rwdsu believes that this is an important sign of respect of deeply held religious beliefs this labor day the workers at shelbyville have more reason than ever to be proud of being part of a union
2199094 the amended contract will be extended throughout the life of the current labor agreement and will recognize the following eight 8 paid holidays new years day martin luther king jr
2199095 its a stupid to assume that we as humans lack the ability to sustain order without religious tradition

2199099 revelation is an nwo tool to make christians stand down
2199100 what i resent is all the phony christians ive run into who arent real christians who tell me
2199101 thats my problem is that when hitler was slaughtering people all over europe most christians literally laid there and took it because they said oh hes the anti christ this is the end of the world
2199102 and so im saying that i have a choice to make i have to in this one life to live im being tested and im not going to just say the games outcome is already you know the die are already cast and so im not going to be involved and im not going to try to do something and take action
2199103 but no i totally agree with what youre saying sir its just that i have found that religion has become this big blanket people rap themselves in and then dont ever do anything

2199120 what a jackass stopping so close to me like that
2199121 i just want to go out there and execute whatever we are in
2199122 any time you step between those lines you want to be at your best so any time i step on the field whether its practice a walk through whatever im trying to be perfect
2199123 i think you want to continue to see the progression and if that progression ever stops and its not where you want it to be then thats when you would make a decision
2199124 but right now everything weve asked him to do hes done improvements that weve asked him to make hes made
2199125 theres been more good than bad but i just have to be more consistent ive felt like this year more than last year i can have a bad play and continue to have a good practice after that in the past if i had a bad play id continue to have a downslide in practice i had a bad play here and there and i feel like after that bad play i pretty much move on

2199138 with more than 30 people killed dozens missing 30 000 displaced and damages reaching over one billion euros the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies is launching an emergency appeal to bring immediate assistance to victims of the worst floods in 200 years in ukraine and moldova
2199139 these are the worst floods in two centuries the ground cannot absorb any more water and more rains could trigger mudslides people are in desperate straits food is urgently needed as well as clean water many people have lost crops gardens livestock poultry as well as their food reserves
2199140 moldova is still recovering from a succession of serious droughts for which the red cross provided food aid this is the worst possible irony for europes poorest country where a quarter of the population has emigrated to find work and where many elderly survive on less than one euro 1 50 a day

2199142 neglects the important differences between a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program and a reactor based program and fails to account for the dispersed relatively advanced and hardened nature of irans gas centrifuge facilities
2199143 aimed at creating an indigenous capability to make this equipment and reduce its dependence on smuggling
2199144 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2199145 the sam threat to natos aircrews was far more pronounced and harrowing than media coverage typically depicted
2199146 the guys really got along well and the chemistry was good
2199147 i think so far out of the three years that ive been here so far this is shaping out to be the best in that regard
2199148 not only is he a great player on the field but hes going to be a great guy in the locker room to help build and maintain that chemistry that i was talking about
2199149 i think we should make some pretty good jumps forward from last year
2199150 i think our whole pass offense our pass protecting included thats a focus of ours now and i think were going to continue to get better theres no substitute for experience and a lot of these young guys that we have are just getting reps and reps and getting better
2199151 hes our teammate hes a cornerstone of this team and i think everything will work out
2199152 hes going to have to do whats required of him but i think he knows that and everybodys behind him 100 percent
2199153 hes not real active at this point ive seen him driving around the community a bit
2199154 i talked to him a couple weeks before the u
2199155 hell come back hitting it pretty well ill promise you that i would say in my opinion the masters would be the target for his return to the pga tour i dont think there will be anything before that if it was before that it would be pretty amazing because he swings so hard and puts so much force on that knee it would take a long time to have it strong enough to hold up to him
2199156 i could see him way back in instructional league in his first year after he was drafted and signed
2199157 and hes just been a sponge about learning how to do things and the whole game hes becoming a real good complete player you like to get those young guys to do all facets of the game well and hes doing it real well
2199158 offensively hes always had real quick hands and been able to turn on a pitch early on we tried to get him to go the other way and be able to come back and pull so hes doing a nice job he utilizes his speed well hes fun to watch
2199159 if you look back it was a pretty close race
2199160 as a matter of fact i think span thought he had the job it was a real competitive spring between the two of them so he was on a mission when he got sent down he went to class aaa he didnt pout and to his credit he hung with it and got better at aaa he came up here and just took over
2199161 i think its going to be close to 1 million overall which is pretty significant
2199162 four months ago we were wondering if we were going to operate in the black and all of a sudden because this happens or that happens and we didnt spend here or didnt have to spend there were ok we feel good about what we accomplished in 07 08

2199174 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2199175 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2199176 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2199177 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2199178 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2199179 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2199180 camila wanted to do something special and unique with her mother so they combined their talents and created muxo each bag is one of a kind and literally hand crafted by the two of them so theres a strong sense of love and quality in each piece
2199181 were going into our fourth year of ownership but certainly i think everybody on our team expects great things this year
2199182 were certainly going to be fighting for the division and i think we have the team and the confidence to do it i know that we have the potential to be the best but well wait for the season to unfold to show our true colors
2199183 i think its been a process of growing and bringing in the players that would help our team i think this is going to be our year
2199184 i think its probably only a dozen players that have been with the team since i came in 05 that are still with the team
2199185 well wait for the season to unfold and im sure that during the season our coaching staff the personnel department and rick spielman vice president of player personnel will make the moves that are necessary to continue to improve
2199186 and i think certainly signing up guys who are an important part of the team as matt is will be a priority as the season moves on
2199187 were going to look at him as a combination kind of safety outside linebacker type
2199188 then we ultimately want to see potentially does he fit at the middle linebacker position we just feel like this hes one of our better football players and we know what he can do at quarterback we think weve got a pretty good grasp on that
2199189 what i want to do is see whether or not hes a defensive player see where his temperament is at see the things that he can do on defense hes an outstanding long snapper he may be our long snapper next season but we really feel good about what hes going to contribute to our team
2199190 stoa could have played in the playoffs but we didnt want to have him give up a season of competition
2199191 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2199192 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
2199193 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2199194 the last 24 hours have been crazy this offseason has been bizarre but im excited by this opportunity
2199195 im not going to blame one side or the other a lot of things happened this season a lot of shocking things but at this point its irrelevant
2199196 theres no ill feelings he has a positive reputation within this organization
2199197 i hope i can play at the level that ive always played at
2199198 theres no guarantees there have never been any guarantees for me its football and anything can happen
2199199 i always wanted to be a packer and i think i always will be a packer
2199200 im not a traitor never will be its business its the way it works i gave everything i could possibly give i hope the jets fans see the same thing
2199201 i havent played in new york im a south mississippi boy but i know how tough the city can be and i know how great it can be
2199202 it can be as good as you want to make it
2199203 it will be weird to see him in a jets uniform
2199204 im not tired of answering questions but the more questions about this team and stuff like that will be more appropriate
2199205 we dont have to play him twice thats huge hopefully it will give us some type of an advantage not to take anything away from aaron rodgers and what they are building there but brett favre is brett favre
2199206 you have to take it game by game with brett favre
2199207 one day hell come out and look like the mvp and some days he will come out there and give you a lot of chances so happy to see him go but sad that hes gone
2199208 these relationships with elderly women potentially exposed the boys to risks of infections to sexually transmitted infections including hiv aids
2199209 anti aimbotting is an arms race that were not going to enter for this old game and this patch doesnt address that or any other feature level changes
2199210 were fully expecting that the first network dvr systems will have every parameter set to be like the rs dvr
2199211 if theres discrete storage required for every customer thats going to be quite a lot of disk you need
2199212 i think what will happen is people will realize that you dont have to force everyone to have different copies of the same program
2199213 it doesnt hurt the content owners any more to have shared storage in a network dvr than everybody having their recordings in their set tops
2199214 but they figured out how to make it work the cable industry is very good at resolving these issues
2199215 now it doesnt make a difference where i set up my recording and where i view my recording
2199216 youre in tune with nature you hear the sound of the water the birds
2199217 and i have to listen to this crapola all day long
2199218 had wonderful neighbours it was such a lovely time it was a wonderful lifestyle we had a social club wed get together for dinners play cards
2199219 one step and youre down to the patio one step and youre on the grass
2199220 when realtors come to the door they offer you the moon
2199221 go straight from their car to the garage and into the house
2199222 but for somebody whos been here a long time the new money has changed the dynamic terribly

2199227 were at a stalemate mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
2199228 there are a lot of people out there holy crap
2199229 stiamo lavorando sodo per capire che cosa vogliono i clienti americani

2199231 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2199232 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2199233 dear athletes remember that you are the role models for the youth of the world
2199234 reject doping and cheating make us proud of your achievements and your conduct
2199235 as one world we grieved with you over the tragic earthquake in sichuan province we were moved by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2199236 may these olympic games bring you joy hope and pride you have chosen as the theme of these games one world one dream that is what we are tonight
2199237 beijing you are a host to the present and a gateway to the future thank you
2199238 this iconic stadium is one of the worlds new wonders
2199239 it was a fitting setting for an amazing opening ceremony
2199240 that was spectacular tonight the world was able to join in a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2199241 its august 2008 there is not one word you will not hear one word out of anyone about 2007 its august 2008 ill answer any questions about august 2008
2199242 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things im here to help the jets win
2199243 im a little out of shape compared to the other guys
2199244 no corresponden a la realidad del pa s pues pertenecen a una encuesta realizada el 2007
2199245 the red icon on your iphone or ipod touch always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were able to afford this
2199246 as a young guy it is a big honor for me to play at the opening ceremony and to represent a new generation of chinese people to the world
2199247 im part of a new generation in china enjoying a very different way of life from our parents we love american culture and classical music but we also have strong chinese traditions
2199248 i fell in love with music and never looked back
2199249 the world has never needed mutual understanding mutual toleration and mutual cooperation as much as it does today
2199250 i can go outside but i have to ride in the police car with my guards wherever i go
2199251 our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2199252 i never thought id see this day we just feel so fortunate and happy
2199253 our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2199254 i call on all those engaged in hostilities to respect it
2199255 we are telling air china immediately suspend operations of all flights
2199256 otherwise we will bomb the planes we will crash the aeroplanes into the site of the olympics
2199257 flight 406 had to return after the bomb threat no one was injured
2199258 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2199259 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2199260 i am optimistic about chinas future young people who grow up with the freedom to trade goods will ultimately demand the freedom to trade ideas especially on an unrestricted internet
2199261 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and its own traditions yet change will arrive
2199262 and it will be clear for all to see that those who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china they are the people who will make china a great nation in the 21st century
2199263 i dont pay a lot of attention to it this is the third time i went through this with dole i went through this with bush and now my name has surfaced with mccain its always nice im flattered by it but my attention is focused on ohio

2199271 i feel like some of the stuff that happened in the offseason has been my motivation to play well this season ive been pretty focused
2199272 sometimes it might get portrayed as one way when that might not be the case i guess when everything is done and over with then you could possibly talk about it it depends on how everything goes

2199275 desgraciadamente no tenemos las mejores relaciones ni la mejor opini n del equipo ministerial y menos a n con edmundo p rez yoma
2199276 no comparten la idea de p rez yoma de empoderar de forma incitada a los intendentes
2199277 lo m s importante es que al senador g mez en los comit s pol ticos no lo escuchan
2199278 i have never seen in all my years going back to when i started becoming active in politics in college at ohio state i have never seen an issue drive as many people to make comments to me as the issue of high gasoline prices
2199279 the unbelievable amount of comments and questions concerning gas prices exceeds anything ive ever experienced before in politics
2199280 what i say is you cant just do one thing there is not a silver bullet thats going to make everything better
2199281 but we have to do it right as one republican i have been supportive of a number of things that a lot of republicans havent been
2199282 what could be seen now as american technology being used by other countries not only in the nuclear area but in the area of drilling and refineries
2199283 a lot of that technology is built in the united states a lot of that technology is developed in the united states so we are exporting our technology exporting our energy know how for others to use and use against us so when i say im for all of the above i really am for all of the above in terms of more production whether its wind solar im for it all we have to do it all were in a position today that we cant afford to bury our heads in the sand
2199284 i think ohios well placed because of coal we are not well placed because of our tax system because of our regulatory system we need to get there
2199285 one of the least publicized parts of the job of a member of congress is the role of helping people
2199286 i can give you literally hundreds of examples of things that weve been able to do in my years in congress that has impacted a persons life
2199287 and you take a picture with the mom and the baby and then go on your way
2199288 and you realize that with the hours of being in washington away from your family and the politics and the name calling and the crap that go on in a political campaign the maligning of the record the taking out of context the votes incidents like helping with the adoption really make it all worthwhile
2199289 i dont pay a lot of attention to it this is the third time i went through this with dole i went through this with bush and now my name has surfaced with mccain its always nice im flattered by it but my attention is focused on ohio

2199293 were in danger of seeing the 2008 election stolen again as in 2000 and 2004
2199294 in florida in 2000 and ohio in 2004 we witnessed the obstruction and manipulation of votes by election officials and possible tampering with computer voting machines but equally insidious is the malapportionment of electoral college votes which disenfranchises whole sections of the voting public
2199295 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
2199296 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution
2199297 weve witnessed in election after election how some states have used the winner take all formula to prevent the votes of political ethnic and other minorities from being counted
2199298 alter the fate of the 2008 presidential election in a manner different from any presidential election in the nations history
2199299 by refusing to challenge electoral college malapportionment in 2000 and 2004 which blocked democratic electors from voting in those elections the democratic partys leaders abandoned tens of thousands of their own voters just as they failed to challenge the election irregularities in florida and ohio in 2000 and 2004
2199300 will they fail to challenge malapportionment again in 2008 and hand the republicans another victory barack obama would not be the democratic nominee if not for the democratic partys proportional assignment of primary delegates the winner take all provisions in the general election present the distinct possibility that mr obama in 2008 will win the popular vote by a considerably larger margin than did gore in 2000 but will repeat the democratic loss in the electoral college
2199301 if proportional assignment is considered by democrats to be vital to democracy in their primary elections why wont they fight for it in the general election
2199302 the democratize the electoral college program exposes the hypocrisy and fraud behind charges that the mckinney campaign might spoil the democratic presidential tickets chances of winning democratic leaders should have to explain why they choose to ignore 13 additional electors from southern states that theyd gain through the green partys presidential electors project why is the green party fighting to give voice to democratic voters that the democratic party will not fight for let me be clear were not doing this to assist barack obama but to foster real democracy and voter participation and to offer cynthia mckinney as the truly democratic choice for all the people
2199303 americans dont vote for president instead we vote for an electoral college which was created in the late 1700s to expressly increase the power of the slave states and which it is still doing
2199304 the electors in these southern states arkansas 6 electoral votes georgia 15 electoral votes louisiana 9 electoral votes tennessee 11 electoral votes texas 34 electoral votes are not bound by state law to cast their vote for a specific candidate

2199357 russia may consider deploying strategic bombers or station tactical missiles in its close ally belarus as a counter measure to a planned u s missile shield in europe moscows envoy to minsk said on wednesday
2199358 once poland has signed an agreement with the american side on deployment of elements of the missile defense there we will be able to discuss some additional aspects of our military and technical cooperation with belarus
2199359 russia mulls arms in belarus to counter u s shield
2199360 russias seemingly newfound interest in resuming its positions in cuba has appeared at a time when moscow is growing increasingly apprehensive about the proposed u s missile defense system in eastern europe analysts say
2199361 we need to reestablish positions on cuba and in other countries
2199362 russia should take advantage of all its capabilities to protect its national interests including the interests in the field of security
2199363 news analysis russia seeks military presence in cuba in response to u s missile shield
2199364 never before have so many people been abandoned at once
2199365 it is inconceivable to think about losing 10 000 jobs in the first wave and the estimates run in the 30 000 range as the wave continues
2199366 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to avert it
2199367 we put in all that time and effort and poured our souls into this campaign its really unfortunate too that what he did now dilutes his credibility on the poverty issue where he really had the change to make a difference
2199368 but hes very good at compartmentalizing whether somethings going on in his family or on the staff hed be able to turn around go on stage and give a brilliant speech so maybe he just compartmentalized those emotions
2199369 she actually is okay im pretty impressed by how shes handling it
2199370 i thought it was inappropriate for them to call me
2199371 all i can tell you is that he was claimed but nothing came to fruition
2199372 eu estava ao lado da minha barraca quando ouvi uma grande explos o e senti como se o inferno estivesse na minha frente quando me dei por mim estava no hospital recebendo tratamento
2199373 me and leon mckenzie were strike partners at palace and hes been calling me all the time telling me i should sign and im really pleased
2199374 i can score goals at this level and now im looking forward to doing that for coventry so im hoping i can play some part against norwich on saturday
2199375 obviously its fantastic weve managed to get clinton over the line
2199376 hes spent a lot of time training with us and weve made no secret of the fact we wanted him to join us
2199377 ive still got a long way to go for me its about keeping my head down because i know ive still got a lot to prove
2199378 im definitely looking to add goals to my game next season therere improvements to make in everyones game and im a player who likes to work hard on my weaknesses i feel theres got to be a lot more goals from me next season
2199379 im hoping i do manage to get on the scoresheet a few times next season because i know how important it is to score goals from midfield i always feel very comfortable creating but ive got to get myself in more goalscoring positions sitting deep the system here should suit me a bit more and therell be more chances to get forward

2199398 who sang the song always something there to remind me
2199399 these are not the big cancers that are going to yield huge profits
2199400 if this drug were to go away whats left for these children
2199401 these types of increases are rare exceptions and not the norm
2199402 discovered new uses for this drug and we repriced it to capture its true value
2199403 when you get past the top 500 drugs or so most employers and payers just dont have time to monitor this information and that creates an opportunity for extraordinary price increases
2199404 i hit some good shots on those holes and made birdie
2199405 after my third birdie the next four holes were pretty much into the wind right there and i was just trying to make par on those holes

2199407 will continue to be managed in the same manner as before and will continue to provide customers with products of the highest quality
2199408 what keeps me going is knowing it is important and right and science will prevail
2199409 what we found is that neither of these popular and commonly used treatments offered a higher birth rate than no treatment at all
2199410 what weve shown is that neither of these first line treatments is better than the couples trying themselves
2199411 although it may seem a bit counterintuitive this is the one area of medicine where doing nothing could be as effective as going for any of these treatments
2199412 in the u s generally higher doses of clomid are used typically 100 milligrams a day
2199413 if anything the take home point from this study is in the group where they did insemination alone without any fertility drug there wasnt a significant increase in pregnancy
2199414 just doing insemination alone is probably not going to really increase a persons chance of pregnancy
2199415 if you have a patient with good results on the ovarian reserve testing then expectant management no treatment might be something the patient might desire
2199416 in the united states the indication of unexplained infertility is definitely managed more aggressively than it was in this study
2199417 i really like working with the young people in the prison
2199418 its so important to pass on information that protects their lives
2199419 but you have to be very careful and sensitive to how ready the other person is to talk about hiv
2199420 what keeps me going is knowing it is important and right and science will prevail
2199421 were all born somewhere on that continuum but all the training in the world can only move you a little bit
2199422 nutrition is key in anybodys life whether were professional athletes or working at a desk
2199423 people stress about the calorie content of protein but they should be stressing about sugar
2199424 you want to keep your body running so efficiently that everything youre using is converted to energy and your body doesnt store anything
2199425 if your clothes fit great and you like the way you look in the mirror does it matter what the scale says
2199426 its like age you could be 45 but feel 30 age and weight are just numbers that we get obsessed with but they dont mean were healthy
2199427 the more intense the training is the more youre going to reach your potential
2199428 you will not find an olympic athlete who is not highly highly trained they dont roll out of bed and win the 100 meter sprint or the 50 freestyle they spend hours and hours of training of all sorts
2199429 people are hesitant at the beginning to spend the money with a personal trainer but after a month when theyre tightening their waistband and their shorts are loose they really see the results
2199430 after a while you adjust to the expense and it becomes part of your lifestyle

2199434 i have four boys ages 10 and under and when i saw this i thought my god said sherman mayor bill magers
2199435 but when you hear about the dead it just hits you
2199436 we went around to the bodies and the local police looked in the pockets for identification
2199437 if they had identification then that information was shared between me and the detectives
2199438 there were two ministers that came up from dallas so theyre helping identifying and dealing with the families
2199439 its premature to jump out there and say exactly what may have happened
2199440 basically we generally know what happened massive blunt trauma but just to cover the bases we ordered two one male and one female
2199441 the bodies were already outside the bus in body bags
2199442 it was still a horrible scene you had bodies and medical personnel police and ambulances it was just a horrible scene

2199454 the colbert report is a hugely popular national tv show and our goal is to try to get as best as possible in a satirical environment a positive image out about columbia the gamecocks the university of south carolina and innovista
2199455 i found this better than the male condom or other female contraceptives there is no pain or discomfort in using this
2199456 at first my husband was not sure about it but now even hes come around
2199457 at first these women found the concept of a female condom amusing
2199458 they even laughed at it but now they like it they keep asking me to give them more and more of these
2199459 ive told them that it not only prevents aids but is better for their sexual health
2199460 weve got a sense of freedom of being liberated we feel completely in control
2199461 we first began marketing the female condom primarily among sex workers three years ago
2199462 we then decided to introduce this among rural women since they are also a vulnerable group with little access to public health services
2199463 initially we thought the response would be poor but in fact its been very very good
2199464 itll really help us because the existing ones are not effective
2199465 on the one hand a government body is promoting sexual health among us but on the other we are penalised for expressing our sexuality
2199466 since homosexuality is illegal in the eyes of the law we are frequently harassed by the police
2199467 its all very well to come out with a gay condom but why not change the law
2199468 even companies that already make similar condoms available through the retail network do not brand them as gay condoms they call them super strong condom or powerful condom or stud condoms
2199469 if she would not have had that vision test i would never have known
2199470 and they had her cover the one eye and she did just fine and then when they covered the other eye it was shocking i think anytime that you find something is wrong or not normal its devastating
2199471 im so relieved and going to make sure i do everything they tell me to make sure this works for her for life
2199472 shes gotta live with the decision that her mom and dad made for her when she was seven years old
2199473 and were just hoping that weve made the right decision that this is something that will be a long term benefit for her

2199479 our results show both the left and right sides of the rowers hearts are larger and function at an enhanced capacity compared with those of controls
2199480 the causes of this are not completely clear it could be due to the production of growth factors such as igf 1 during training
2199481 people do have different levels of igf 1 naturally although elite athletes do tend to have higher levels

2199506 you teach me sir how a beggar should be answered
2199507 let him have the ring let my love and the great service he has done for me be valued against your wifes displeasure
2199508 that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws its beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world
2199509 what does the poetry or the value of the ring signify
2199510 you swore to me when i gave it to you that you would keep it till the hour of death and now you say you gave it to the lawyers clerk i know you gave it to a woman
2199511 i gave it to a youth a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy no higher than yourself be was clerk to the young counselor that by his wise pleading saved antonios life this prating boy begged it for a fee and i could not for my life deny him
2199512 you were to blame gratiano to part with your wifes first gift i gave my lord bassanio a ring and i am sure be would not part with it for all the world
2199513 my lord bassanio gave his ring away to the counselor and then the boy his clerk that took some pains in writing he begged my ring
2199514 no by my honor no woman had it but a civil doctor who refused three thousand ducats of me and begged the ring which when i denied him he went displeased away what could i do sweet portia i was so beset with shame for my seeming ingratitude that i was forced to send the ring after him pardon me good lady had you been there i think you would have begged the ring of me to give the worthy doctor
2199515 i once did lend my body for bassanios sake and but for him to whom your husband gave the ring i should have now been dead i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit your lord will never more break his faith with you
2199516 give him this ring and bid him keep it better than the other

2199518 we want to protect our sovereignty and we need a period of time to complete the construction of iraqi security forces because our current capacity is unable to defend the iraqi people internally or externally alone
2199519 is the need to type united states military for a period of time
2199520 since the first day of the negotiations refused to be no immunities of corporate security
2199521 discussions are currently on the immunities accorded to the military and americans working with them
2199522 we asked to be included as contexts interests of iraq and the rights of its citizens
2199523 assure the iraqi citizens that there will be no arrangements affecting iraqi sovereignty will not be any understandings reached without submission to parliament and the political council of national security because the issue seriously
2199524 negotiations are still going well in order to ensure iraqs sovereignty
2199525 we will not accept dictates from any foreign body because the united states of america helped us get rid of the despotic regime of saddam hussein and iraqs relations with the united states and the european union important task with japan and every task in context and framework
2199526 if we reach an understanding with america final where these grounds we go to our heads held high and share our parliament opinion
2199527 will not accept any understanding without a written submission to parliament
2199528 we need to guarantee security and support of the united states of america in this period of time and achieve the status of the partnership in the areas of economic and political cooperation technical and cultural development
2199529 will not be in any way an approach to the use of a base for attacking iraq the interests of our neighbours
2199530 until now could not complete the negotiations but reached the advanced stages and there is something important has been reached in the fields of economy and helping iraq to join the wto and cultural exchanges technical and other concepts of the world seek access to hard
2199531 the movement of military forces will not be without prior approval from the iraqi side through the joint coordinating committees and to building the convention is to protect iraq and support the democratic political system and protection from internal and external challenges
2199532 there is no timetable for ending negotiations and refuses to define iraqi politics where he was supposed to time the completion of negotiations late last month and despite that we have come a long way but the important understandings between the two sides will be completed only by ensuring the fundamental interests of iraq
2199533 there has been progress regarding the time frames for leaving the armed forces but he did not refer to any specific timing because node that still intractable on the granting of judicial immunity for u s troops

2199554 even if reasonable efforts such as these broadcasting the meeting in an adjoining room prove inadequate to accommodate everyone the meeting will still qualify as a public meeting for purposes of the open meeting law

2199568 the pub isnt where you go get drunk its where you go meet your neighbors and your friends and your family so in the daytime kids are always in the pub its where you hang out its your clubhouse
2199569 we wanted a community place we wanted it to be homey and like a real pub like a real irish pub
2199570 people walk in and we know them when jim walks in we say hi jim we know about the people and our floor staff is pretty stable theres a bond between them and the customers already and with us too we absolutely adore our customers
2199571 its a warm filling space where people can feel comfortable and its that old homey feel
2199572 that was the hardest part it was a tough pitch to keep fair
2199573 i was just trying to hit it and it worked out for us its a great feeling
2199574 ibanez is good im not sure what the pitch was but he was able to get it and won the game for them
2199575 we had plenty of opportunities to win the game ourselves but it didnt really present itself in the ninth andy was really good for us and their guy was good for them as well
2199576 i cant see any experienced dealer working in a decent casino giving up what they have to go over to encore
2199577 i believe he will have to settle for a lot of inexperienced help straight out of dealers school or from minor casinos
2199578 but if youre only making 80 a day at a downtown property and you can make at least 150 a day at encore youre going to take that job
2199579 it caused a problem and i apologize but weve told them were going to stick to our program
2199580 they promised me in an aggressive fashion that i would be ok
2199581 working men and women who have courageously stood up for the american dream
2199582 we work hard for all pro and we want the company to succeed
2199583 but this should be our choice we are not being recognized and we are being disrespected by not getting any benefits including something as simple as bathroom breaks and lunch breaks

2199585 she did want a permanent job in the construction industry im sure that is something a lot of people would want
2199586 but the nature of the construction industry means jobs come and go local leaders helped her out to the extent that they could but when it came down to it there werent any jobs available that matched her set of skills

2199594 the impressive rally to date notwithstanding it still remains to be seen whether another retracement will develop should crude oil gold and other commodities reverse course
2199595 a strong rally in these sectors could send the market down again while mr market can do whatever he pleases it is highly unusual for stocks to bottom in the summer
2199596 it would not be imprudent to see what september and october have to offer before anyone begins to talk seriously about the bottom for investors with an appetite for the financials however we would suggest dusting off that old tried and true tactic of dollar cost averaging as a prudent means to establish positions
2199597 they threatened us with attorney fees if we didnt withdraw it
2199598 to determine which employees are eligible to receive an allocation of tips from the shared pool of tips or gratuities
2199599 an obvious explanation is jim or peter fell in while trying to retrieve a lure found wrapped around the port side rudder and the other went to his aid
2199600 falling in would be easy and getting back on board nearly impossible
2199601 i therefore conclude that the men were all in the ocean without life jackets soon after they passed george point
2199602 from that point the end would have been swift none of them was a good swimmer the seas were choppy the men would quickly have become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves although i cant exclude the possibility of a shark attacking them drowning is a far more likely cause of death

2199608 weve found that under extreme conditions elite athletes are able to draw on cognitive reserves which allow them to counter the effects of heat stress
2199609 their mental acuity is actually seen to improve a result that is of enormous benefit to competitors in field sports such as hockey
2199610 our findings have been able to offer reassurance to the gb players that their brain functions will not be affected by heat stress

2199619 not only performers but sound and lighting technicians marketing people and design people there hasnt been much substantial thought and discussion about how important that is to this community what theyve given to the community hasnt even been measured not just in dollars but in enrichment

2199626 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2199627 with regards to the string of faults that were reported in the media malaysia airlines investigated and established that these were unsubstantiated
2199628 this is based on the fact that all these aspects were originally checked and found to be free from defect during the maintenance check and test flight with the concurrence from the qantas team
2199629 we are fully committed to executing all aspects of aircraft engineering maintenance with no compromise to safety and security as well as meeting the expectations of both our customers and the global regulatory authorities that have recognised our competencies
2199630 well first im not sure if there was any concerns from our workers i think the unions have created more confusion than raised concerns
2199631 a 22 month sentence is totally inadequate its something the dpp director of public prosecutions really needs to appeal
2199632 our supreme court has a reputation for being the most lenient in the country
2199633 here we have a case where this woman is stabbed 57 times with a knife this surely would be at the upper end of that scale

2199637 six excellent ideas in an internet video in september 2007 abu yahya al libi a prominent al qaeda leader mockingly gave the west six tips to wage ideological warfare highlight the views of jihadists who renounce violence publicise stories about jihadist atrocities against muslims enlist muslim religious leaders to denounce jihadists as heretics back islamic movements that emphasise politics over jihad discredit and neutralise jihadist ideologues and play up personal or doctrinal disputes among jihadists these would indeed be good starting points
2199638 capitulation will eliminate any motivation for terrorist groups to continue to exist
2199639 struck by a sense of great intellectual power one knows one is encountering an extraordinary mind
2199640 so how can he write such terrible things about american foreign policy
2199641 to destroy al queda we have to destroy it in our imaginations because this is the only place where it exists

2199643 we are creating enemies faster than we can kill them
2199644 9 11 happened people disagree as to how to respond
2199645 we are creating enemies faster than we can kill them
2199646 while we may be one of the most militarized nations since sparta
2199647 so al qaeda is just a figment of western imagination
2199648 we dont want to understand the terrorists we want to kill them

2199658 develop a communist cuban terror campaign in the miami area in other florida cities and even in washington
2199659 the desired resultant from the execution of this plan would be to place the united states in the apparent position of suffering defensible grievances from a rash and irresponsible government of cuba and to develop an international image of a cuban threat to peace in the western hemisphere
2199660 are you saying that this could not have possibly been caused by a controlled demolition as the landlord admitted and independent experts looking at footage not knowing it was wtc7 have observed also in the above wtc7 video
2199661 the concept of proving witting contact that alone makes for some dubious logic in using this for e

2199669 todays settlement will minimize the risk to clark county residents from polluted water runoff and hazardous waste discharges from the sunrise mountain landfill
2199670 this essentially memorializes the actions that are required in the ongoing environmental remediation project
2199671 weve been working diligently with the county and the epa to get to this point
2199672 we urge the court to approve this consent decree for the benefit of all our citizens
2199673 its punks like this that are ruining the neighborhood for our citizens
2199674 this was a family enjoying the balmy evening in the park and obviously their night was ruined
2199675 it hasnt been a large source of revenue but it certainly makes sense if we have the space available and were not using it
2199676 we could certainly supplement one budget or another with that lease dedicate those dollars say for maintenance of the whole building
2199677 they want to be able to turn down people and they dont want to be seen as favoring some parties over others
2199678 you have to be mindful of this its no different from deciding to let girl scouts collect donations at city hall you just want to have something in place thats reasonable thats fair minded something that will stand the test of any sort of challenge that comes along

2199686 it is clear that mr adelson failed to appear without legal justification or excuse
2199687 without dr baramidze the one month waiting time for a visit will continue to spiral to unacceptable levels
2199688 at the stardust we took bets on olympic basketball including the usa against russia
2199689 we were hesitant to do it at first though because we didnt want to put ourselves in a position where we would have to root for the russians
2199690 it was a sensitive situation because the cold war was going on
2199691 we skewed the price betting line so that people had to bet on russia if they wanted to bet at all because there was no way in hell we bookmakers wanted to be rooting for russia not in that climate
2199692 it wasnt a big decision at all because i dont think many people wanted to bet on russia
2199693 you would have had to come into the stardust wearing a mask to make a bet on russia
2199694 life on the edge swim a small jump what felt like the leap of death lands you in a small rock pool at the edge of the falls as you stand this close to such raw natural beauty you can barely hear yourself screaming above the sound of the water rushing down while adrenalin pumps through your body turning it into a shaking excitable mess you realise why the not eating before swimming rule has always stuck
2199695 i decided to take over as head coach because i thought i could offer them more than anyone else could and the team definitely made a sufficient jump
2199696 ill be a successful coach here if i can advance any particular player on to the next level whether its the ontario hockey league or an american or canadian university
2199697 you never lose that drive to compete and it slowly rubs off on the players
2199698 the odd time ill throw on the equipment and go through the drills im not in as good shape as my players but they see my will to compete and to improve ive been trained that way my whole life
2199699 its a big advantage for kids when they have coaches with that kind of mileage
2199700 in the future i think youll see more junior a teams with coaches who have played hockey at a high level
2199701 albion is a great venue because of its camp grounds
2199702 we were able to build bike trails around its landsite and people are able to camp here overnight
2199703 i take this race very serious but its not a competition its just for fun
2199704 its more and less a way to stay shape and healthy and have a good time
2199705 running is such an inexpensive activity and the health benefits are life long
2199706 our goal is to have a minimum of 500 kids in our one mile race in our first year
2199707 we picked 10 miles because its not a standard distance that most people have run very often and will offer both a challenge and yet is attainable by almost anyone
2199708 unlike most races that start in the early morning the c3 kinetico caledon running festival will start at 12 30 allowing people to get to church sleep or have a nice late breakfast
2199709 we are so lucky to live in caledon and our goal is to help those who are in need
2199710 our goal with the c3 caledon kinetico running festival is to put the same awesome community event on in september that we do in may with the kids of steel
2199711 after all staying home costs less but dressing for it is a great reason to reward yourself for saving the money that you didnt use if you did go out
2199712 the girls and boys used to throw pillows and even their cat over the dormitory walls
2199713 but we dont think the cat ever got hurt because theyre always supposed to land on their feet
2199714 in cantonese the language of southern china and hong kong the word for fah means eight but also sounds like the word for make a lot of fortune
2199715 i am extremely pleased to again have the opportunity to participate in this program
2199716 sara has been a great asset to our office and i trust that she has learned a great deal about canadian politics
2199717 working in davids office has been a life changing experience
2199718 it has given me the opportunity to experience canadian politics first hand as well to make an educated comparison of canadian and u s political systems
2199719 michel is a good course designer and i think he built a fair course
2199720 it all came down to only two double clear it was a good class
2199721 i rode a horse that i hadnt ridden in years so it was fun to be back on him he jumped well
2199722 it was the last time before we leave for the olympics to have everyone all the team members together and the crowd was happy that we were here it was really nice
2199723 it will be up to our hitters to shorten up our swings and make sure the orillia pitchers are throwing strikes because if theyre not we have to be able to take the walk
2199724 in the event that a soldier s family is confronted with a sudden and unexpected bill or realistically if the soldier is killed or wounded overseas and there is a need to support that situation then that money is set aside by the association for that purpose
2199725 this purpose of the event is to help us raise awareness of the regimental association and help us raise money so that we can support these funds
2199726 these are canadian citizens our neighbors peoples sons and daughters who have given their time to not only volunteer for the regiment but to volunteer for active service overseas and its important that we recognize the sacrifice they have made
2199727 for every soldier deployed overseas theres a whole family and a network of friends left behind that worry about them
2199728 the work that the association does is very important because theres a whole social infrastructure that is put in place to help those families
2199729 any event that helps raise funds for families and service members is an excellent cause
2199730 we should find a way to encourage our corporate partners to match the money raised dollar for dollar
2199731 this tells us there is another face of adoption it is more complex than we had thought
2199732 weve seen an increase in same sex couples adopting and this is a trend all over the country
2199733 if you think about same sex couples gay men who want children really have to adopt but gay women can have their own children i dont see as many gay female couples adopting as gay male couples
2199734 it is not just white married couples who are adopting children
2199735 because the characteristics of children that women and couples seek to adopt may not correspond to the characteristics of children in the foster care system women and couples may seek children from outside the foster care system to adopt
2199736 do you know anywhere that has a good rack of penguin paperbacks
2199737 well were revamping our show to change the pace and the flow of the show and to include songs that we havent been doing as much recently we havent really started rehearsing yet so i dont really know how its gonna turn out we just want to make sure it has a fresh energy for people that have come in previous years even though theyll still get to hear basically what they wanna hear the steely dan songs played more or less how they were recorded in some cases well do rewrites segues and stuff make it a different live experience theres a couple songs that id like to do that well maybe get to do this year but i hate to say in advance in case it doesnt happen and then fans are coming to the shows with signs and stuff throwing rotten tomatoes at us if we dont do certain songs
2199738 the melodic and rhythmic heart of cherished recorded versions while simultaneously displaying his own original and powerful musicality
2199739 by 1977 am radio was nearing the end of its reign as the vehicle by which the top 40 took shape and was disseminated
2199740 i was definitely passionate and very assertive verbally in saying it was a raping of the earth and ruining of the wetlands i said i want to see whats under the tarp i wanted to tell the three guys they were killing animals and plants so i did
2199741 ballona institutes activities have been determined to be incompatible with the departments management goals and objectives

2199744 tap ndome con la s bana para ir a dormir
2199745 everything i touch just falls to pieces everyone i try to help just falls
2199746 are you asking me to explain my full epistemology to you here on the street corner
2199747 what is the measure of a god gerak is it the scope of their power or how they choose to wield that power would a god who is prepared to lead us on the path of enlightenment so contradict this divine benevolence by destroying all those who refuse to believe in him
2199748 have we truly lived as slaves for so long that we must fear being free
2199749 i dont get a cozy feeling when i go over some of the reports
2199750 i hate to see the environment destroyed because of a gravel pit
2199751 i have a birds eye perfect view over this entire operation he declared while there are plans to screen the site with trees he pointed out they will take many years to grow
2199752 would you want to buy a house across from a gravel pit
2199753 fact all descriptions of artwork architecture documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate
2199754 whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is commendable if there is any excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things
2199755 microsoft sharedview beta is a fast easy way to share documents and screen views with small groups of friends or coworkers anytime anywhere use sharedview to put your heads together and collaborate
2199756 if youre going to be a bear be a grizzly
2199757 while we recognize the challenges facing municipalities and developers as they implement the growth plan for the greater golden horseshoe our government believes there is no need for a public inquiry
2199758 municipal leaders developers and communities need to work together to plan successfully for an additional 3 7 million people and 1 8 million jobs in the region
2199759 how far up the provincial food chain does this information travel
2199760 were willing to defend your plan but youve got to be there with us
2199761 i think we were a little ahead of the curve
2199762 the open traceable and fair democratic process that caledon council has consistently followed
2199763 there is no excess population to be handed out to anyone
2199764 caledon is planning caledon is moving forward we know where were going and we have the majority of the population behind us
2199765 and unfortunately were going to have to wait years to see the downside of this
2199766 sadly we learned it doesnt sound like the province is considering doing a public inquiry
2199767 if the currency fluctuation doesnt go in its favor its going to be in even deeper trouble
2199768 when did you learn to be confident and to become accountable for your actions
2199769 you should consider it it would be a great job a way to make wonderful connections
2199770 it will be hard for you to be anything but a copy girl doing what you are doing now xeroxing
2199771 spec is a programming system that aims to provide programmers with a higher degree of rigor than in common languages today the spec language extends the object oriented net language c adding features like non null types pre and postconditions and object invariants in addition to static type checking and compiler emitted runtime checks for specifications spec has a static program verifier the program verifier translates spec programs into verification conditions which are then analyzed by an automatic theorem prover
2199772 there is no separate operations department at amazon you build it you run it
2199773 in the beginning we wondered what similarities or differences would emerge between these two groups of canadian teens living on opposite ends of the country
2199774 in the end the project shows a unique connection between these two cultures and landscapes
2199775 theyve been standing out there in the elements for two years so theyre getting cleaned up
2199776 one is getting a new design but only because we couldnt find the original artist who did it
2199777 breast cancer is serious of course and kick cancer has been raising awareness for three years now
2199778 they have given us their promise in 2004 that they would try to raise us 100 000 in four years
2199779 we are very grateful for charity groups like kick cancer
2199780 i was asked to come and participate in todays event back in the win of 2007 by dave babcock
2199781 also this event is a lot more personal to me since my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer
2199782 so far the whole day has been going really well
2199783 a lot of people have turned out and as it seems is having a great time
2199784 businesses can give back to their communities and to the environment
2199785 with its partners trees ontario plants nearly three million healthy trees a year
2199786 our goal is to increase tree planting rates to 10 million trees a year by 2015 we will only achieve this ambitious goal with the financial support and involvement of communities such as businesses on the moraine
2199787 we wanted to put our best foot forward we considered what we are the first thing people see when they get here and last thing when they leave so we wanted to make a good watch mayor john hickenlooper promote denver as a top travel destination impression
2199788 we have these signs in the terminal and the concourses weve replaced the carpeting in the terminal and concourse a and c and installed the moving walkway in concourse c
2199789 all of us looked at the list of opportunities both historic and current and we wanted to present a focus on denvers rich history and diversity
2199790 thought it would be nice to give people a smattering of interesting things
2199791 it was very difficult because colorado is such a rich area
2199792 people always say that as if its a good thing
2199793 from the second quarter forward weve been fairly stable on pricing
2199794 there have been no further price adjustments in the market i dont expect any more because i think foreclosures are becoming less and less a part of our mix
2199795 if you take all the appliances out and really beat it up its easy to find a 10 percent adjustment
2199796 oh no i have to do the hallway too thats too much work for you
2199797 dont be silly i can finish it in no time
2199798 how many dates do you take a woman on before you expect sex
2199799 they didnt have regulations on how you dispose of waste and all these things in those days
2199800 so they didnt build these mills with any of the environmental protections regulations today are tighter on uranium mills than probably any other chemical plant in world
2199801 its not like there are 200 other suppliers they could go to dana does have some level of bargaining power
2199802 were not out here to pick a fight with chrysler
2199803 most kids will be returning to school in last years duds
2199804 we want to have people sitting at the table who reflect our communitys ethnic cultural age and gender diversity as well as diverse business expertise and personal backgrounds
2199805 the committee work offered me an opportunity to learn about health care in ontario adding depth to what for me and surely for many others was and is a superficial understanding of its complexity
2199806 anyways uh i always work under the theory that once they start blooming you want to remove as much stress as possible
2199807 the concerns about a weakening economy always run to worries about the financials and then you add some negative news to them on their own and youve got what weve got today
2199808 i want you with me and thats the only way to get the pressure on washington to do what we need to do
2199809 theres two people who would benefit from this him on the natural gas side and potentially us on the wind side
2199810 him on the natural gas side and potentially us on the wind side
2199811 the plan goes hand in hand with what al gore is doing
2199812 why should taxpayers pay billions of dollars to help him sell his natural gas
2199813 we are really on the side of the borrower we are trying to work out the best situation we can
2199814 if there is a loss we are the ones that are going to pay most of it
2199815 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
2199816 the slowdown in the economy has definitely affected wage growth that will continue to trickle through
2199817 if you take all the appliances out and really beat it up its easy to find a 10 percent adjustment
2199818 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession
2199819 i remember when i first got the script where joans roommate came to the office and shes just been fired
2199820 and i remember going wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
2199821 i dont think a woman at that time would be office manager and running the whole place if she wasnt driven
2199822 and joan could go out and find a husband quite easily shes an attractive smart successful woman but shes not pursuing that shes doing things that are safe to a certain degree because she cant marry a man whos already married
2199823 she wants it all and yet like many women shes like im a catch im doing all this and what are these guys giving us i think shes a little disillusioned
2199824 as she talked about it you could tell that the memories were coming up in her and that her body was tensing up
2199825 you could tell that watching the show for her was certainly bringing up a lot
2199826 its the initial reading that really takes you by surprise then you just settle in
2199827 i have women coming up to me and saying i love your character
2199828 thats another side of her and i respect that in joan she says and does things that i would never allow myself to do sometimes i think theyre nuts and sometimes i admire the actions she takes
2199829 she was playing she knew what they were doing on the other side of that mirror
2199830 she was taking the control back instead of being the victim she wasnt being slutty she was being confident and sexual that was one of my favorite scenes it was one of the best revealing moments for joan and i also just love the dynamic of men and women on either side of that glass i think it sums up a lot about mad men in particular what goes on in the office
2199831 wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
2199832 but she is nice thats her roommate and joan likes her
2199833 i think i understand now youre actually trying to be nice
2199834 every other girl came in here and listened to what i had to say youre not the first girl to be walked around the office and told what to do every other girl is doing that and been just fine
2199835 lets shake this off lets shake it off lets get a meal and pick up a man
2199836 youve had a long day im here for you you just got fired today
2199837 were going to go out were going to see new york city
2199838 these men were constantly building them up and for what dinner jewelry who cares
2199839 if you play your cards right youll end up with a house in the country and you wont be here at all
2199840 im a catch im doing all this and what are these guys giving us
2199841 im putting in my fair share im holding up my end of the bargain
2199842 how is it being on the show when they treat you like that
2199843 i cant believe someone would say that i cant believe someone would behave that way
2199844 i was a secretary at that time and this is spot on this is how it was
2199845 the doctors were really like that they would treat you like a child and talk to your husband
2199846 youve got to go in there and be like this and be like that
2199847 first of all i know how to act and you know what a woman cant act like you do if i went in with all this comedy and all this pomp they would think i was a expletive i would look like a crazy confident expletive you go in and youre charming and funny and dynamic and quirky
2199848 if i went in there and did that it would be too much i would be too much
2199849 wow when i first met your girlfriend i didnt like her at all but i just love her now
2199850 i just you know i like women who are a little bit more demure
2199851 i love your character shes so empowered she takes control she gets what she wants
2199852 goodie look what ive done i got the big boss man and hes charming and dashing
2199853 theyre cautious there was a lot of negative publicity for conservation easements
2199854 i dont have any buyers calling to ask what the prices are going to be this year
2199855 everybodys waiting longer to make sure things are in good shape
2199856 fidelity national financial is an exceptionally strong stable and well run title company its financial strength and operational acumen will allow our colorado operations to continue to provide the service and performance that our customers have come to expect for so many years
2199857 for years first american was the dominant underwriter in colorado because of mercurys agents now id expect fidelity to claim that position
2199858 i dont think it would be a good idea to have pension obligations similarly passed around
2199859 for technical reasons these transactions are not currently permitted under law but as a policy matter they should be
2199860 the players in this think the market is potentially very big
2199861 under more challenging conditions in some of our markets operating results were mixed
2199862 this relief will enable qwest to have the flexibility to further deploy its broadband services and fiber facilities without overly burdensome regulations
2199863 the best way to protect against getting measles is vaccination its important that people be up to date on their vaccine
2199864 im going to see my grandma who ive havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age where i want to make sure i spend time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2199865 hawaiis spirit of tolerance might not have been perfect or complete but it was and is real
2199866 the opportunity that hawaii offered to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect became an integral part of my world view and a basis for the values that i hold most dear
2199867 opens the way for even more geothermal development and is just one step in our continuing effort to responsibly use and develop clean renewable energy
2199868 it looks like supply is going to come in considerably ahead of demand for the next year to next year and a half
2199869 as the tropics warm are seeing an increased frequency in the heaviest rainfall
2199870 wenn wir ihnen einen kleinen knochen hinwerfen dann werden sie schon springen
2199871 san francisco based method has converted three of its u s product lines covering nine skus to 100 post consumer recycled polyethylene terephthalate rpet bottles from amcor pet packaging
2199872 because we had been successful with 100 pcr bottles in the u k we wanted to explore what could be done in the u s
2199873 when method came to us last year on this project we were hoping to get to 50 pcr content in our trials we tested 10 25 50 75 and 100 thats when we discovered that 100 pcr content was not out of the question but we knew we had a lot of work ahead of us before we could be confident that the bottles meeting all of the criteria could be produced at commercial rates
2199874 ideally you want the original pet bottles not to have been commingled with any other plastic type the best source from a material purity standpoint is pet carbonated soft drink bottles that have been collected from a deposit based program second best are bottles that have been curbside collected
2199875 is not problem for us the equipment can be plugged into whatever spot
2199876 im going to go travel around the world with my husband
