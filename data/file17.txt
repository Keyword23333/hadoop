170000 we are disappointed with these results and our need to increase reserves again but we dug deep into our casualty reserves and made our best attempt to put these issues behind us going forward i have great confidence in dwight evans and the rest of the new management team at white mountains re america through six months catastrophe activity has been relatively light and the expected loss ratios on the business we are currently writing remain attractive the top line is shrinking due to market conditions as we maintain our underwriting discipline our balance sheet and capital position are solid
170001 we are pleased by our improved underwriting results in the second quarter the rate increases we have taken are beginning to favorably impact loss results while higher gas prices have reduced driving and thus claim frequency our growth rate has slowed as we have focused on improving loss results and have reduced marketing spend the investment in answer financial is expanding our platform to meet the needs of insurance shoppers and should improve our growth over time
170002 it was another tough quarter for the markets as the economy moved closer to recession inflation refused to fade and financial institutions continued the string of spectacular write downs of their asset values despite a significant decline in the bond market and further erosion in the equity markets we were able to post a modest positive result for the overall portfolio as a result of our conservative positions and focus on security selection our bonds slid only 0 2 while our equities gained just over 3 the lehman aggregate index was down 1 0 and the s amp p 500 dropped 2 7

170005 should hit the tar out of the ball at fenway
170006 we chose to conduct the maintenance period in the summer when production costs are usually at the highest
170007 the annual routine maintenance of our manufacturing facilities is not expected to affect our sales revenue in the third quarter as we have stocked sufficient inventories to meet our projected demand
170008 but the department put the red flag up on us
170009 he said all along that his life was in danger but they never believed him when the masri name came up the shutters at the department went down
170010 he was gunned down in broad daylight in cold blood his mother was killed before he claimed refugee status here his brother was killed last year and he was gunned down yesterday like a dog on the side of the road
170011 responsibility of the country to which he has been removed anybody who has applied for protection from australia is not removed if we believe that person will be persecuted
170012 he told his story and notwithstanding he had already been shot once he wasnt believed
170013 we sent him back to a place where he was assassinated
170014 he had a deep love of his wife and children he wept for palestine and despite the dreadful adversity of woomera he always had a sense of humour
170015 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
170016 as a result of this decline in real estate values it is less likely that baby boomers who drove the real estate market for the last thirty years and are now reaching retirement age will continue to invest in real estate the upcoming seminar will examine the relationship between entrepreneurial incentive debt investment risk and value in todays depressed real estate market
170017 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
170018 we have the right plan for gm driven by great products building strong brands fuel economy technology leadership and taking full advantage of global growth opportunities
170019 to have achieved record second quarter sales and our second highest quarterly sales performance ever in the face of this difficult economic environment is a testimony to the soundness of the transformational strategy we put in place ten quarters ago clearly our efforts to dramatically reshape our global footprint by expanding our international manufacturing base is paying off handsomely as we have seen strong sales of crisa our mexican product line and in our libbey china glassware
170020 similarly we are quite pleased with the relative strength of our total north american glass business performance which continues to aggressively combat unprecedented natural gas and electricity costs we are seeing the benefits of our lean manufacturing efforts while continuing to provide the quality and service our customers have come to expect from libbey
170021 as the result of our performance to date including ebitda within our previous guidance and expectations for ongoing energy cost pressure we now anticipate full year 2008 ebitda to be in the range of 114 million to 118 million on expected sales of slightly more than 870 million
170022 not only do we tell users the phases of the sales cycle but we also tell them how to complete the sale effectively
170023 that lets the salesperson follow up in a timely manner when clients show interest
170024 its nice to see traditional crm merge with what we call sales knowledge management
170025 a lot of products take sales training and embed it into crm systems but for the most part these only tell a sales rep what to do get to the cio understand customer needs and so on
170026 i dont have all my sales collateral on the blackberry i still carry around my laptop with the data sheets and price sheets

170029 are there only two ways to buy online auction or fixed price
170030 most sellers like the idea of having ways to always optimize the selling price with a buyer
170031 they dont want to be at a computer at 1 a m though
170032 web 2 0 technologies definitely are creating an expectation of faster more efficient transactions
170033 its very important that we protect our position both from a brand recognition point of view and with copyrights and trademarks etc as well as investing money in the patent side of the business
170034 the new design features background images that will change frequently augmented with what we call
170035 extensive user research and exploration of many concepts with our customers pointed us in the direction for this design we want the page to be a great place to start a search and also to intrigue and inform as well we think hotspots will help users discover parts of live search they might not know while not distracting from the core purpose of the page searching

170042 in bad shape and mismanaged on just about every level
170043 officials do not follow rules and do not co operate with the public decisions are veiled in secrecy and poor decisions often based on poor evidence are then made and concealed
170044 but this will not alleviate poverty since those who can afford to buy these farms are obviously not so poor
170045 with the spectre of zimbabwe looming over land reform over southern africa the failure of land reform represents a potential problem of political instability that goes to the core of the swapo majority and strong support among the poor
170046 more importantly no use has been made of ongombo west for resettlement purposes so this expropriation was not driven by any plan to resettle poor people there
170047 it is clear that a large number of farms bought by government have not been used for resettlement purposes the farm houses are often in the possession of government employees apparently having no legal right of occupancy
170048 however the expropriation was illegal at least on the basis that no consultation had taken place in the land reform advisory commission regarding the farmworkers and families 40 people on both farms
170049 okorusu and marburg were expropriated in order to resettle five families of unknown size but simple mathematics reveal that the process was literally a waste of time and money in terms of resettling poor people about 40 poor people were displaced to make room for about 40 other poor people at a cost of n 8 million which strongly suggests a failure of public policy relating to poverty alleviation and is also arguably in violation of natural justice in that the land ministry is creating as much poverty as it eliminates by displacing poor farmworkers by resettling other landless poor people
170050 one of the five selected was a well paid government official who had been a namibian police administrator and at the time was the deputy dean of the law faculty at the university of namibia
170051 this official never occupied his farm but rented it out visiting about once a month from his substantial home in windhoek a three hour drive away obviously providing this person with a free farm while displacing existing farmworkers did not help to resettle any poor people but it did achieve the opposite result in that it created poor people so that this official could have a farm at a substantial cost to the government
170052 here the rationality becomes more perverse and circular there never has been any actual list of the 240 000 landless and poor in namibia who need to be resettled as there is neither transparency nor clear administrative rationality in the land reform process
170053 the former farmworkers of expropriated farms who are in the meantime displaced are simply outcasts moving in with whatever relatives might accept them further impoverishing these relatives

170055 hms is carrying a higher rate of growth out of the first half than we had originally projected with both our state agency and managed care product lines performing strongly
170056 as a result we are raising annual 2008 guidance to 175 million in revenue and 0 75 earnings per diluted share which represent growth over 2007 of 19 and 32 respectively

170062 notwithstanding the strength of our local market stations and local digital media operations our second quarter financial results reflect the reality of a very weak advertising economy and the challenges evident in the domestic macro economy
170063 our focus on cost containment and reductions in capital spending enable us to continue generating strong free cash flow
170064 we are very well positioned to achieve top line growth and strong incremental bottom line improvement as economic conditions eventually stabilize and improve
170065 the local television medium coupled with an aggressive local digital strategy is far and away the most valuable advertising and marketing alternative for local businesses
170066 televisions superior reach and digitals local targeting capabilities are an ideal solution for advertisers who must continue to market their products and services in a competitive and challenging economic environment our company believes in the value of the television medium and in the valuable business model that we have for today and tomorrow
170067 in spite of the challenging economic environment and our continuing investment in new initiatives free cash flow remains strong allowing us to preserve a very strong financial position
170068 at the same time we are able to continue to use a portion of the significant cash flow generated by the business to return capital to investors and reduce debt
170069 during second quarter we repaid 13 0 million of debt bringing our total debt repayment over the past twelve months to 114 0 million
170070 we finished second quarter with 9 2 million of cash on hand and 165 0 million available under our 500 0 million credit facility
170071 the combination of cash flow from operations and availability under the credit facility provides significant financial flexibility as we go forward
170072 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
170073 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
170074 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
170075 the public continues to be extremely downbeat about the national economy the pew center reports with just 10 percent calling the economy in good shape and 72 percent saying the economy is either in a recession 54 percent or depression 18
170076 while rising costs are clearly the top economic problem in the publics view it is far from their only concern pew notes with more than seven in ten calling good jobs hard to find compared with 55 percent a little over a year ago
170077 multiple economic concerns are taking a toll on public optimism pew adds
170078 about half of americans 51 percent expect their personal financial situation to improve over the next year down from 55 percent in march and 60 percent in january
170079 i couldnt quite believe it that i had found this species which isnt supposed to occur here in scotland and that it was living right here under our noses
170080 it is likely that there are many more undiscovered species right under our noses
170081 despite the fact that the mushroom season is just a few weeks old and i have not yet had time to go looking properly these are exciting finds
170082 the main reason for my amazing finds is that there are so few people in the uk with the necessary identification skills to be able to spot these species there are hardly any professional mycologists with the necessary skills left in the uk unlike many other european countries put simply we just dont know what or how many species of fungi we have here
170083 it is also true that some of these species may have recently arrived here from abroad as accidental introductions on imported trees or they have spread as a result of climate change
170084 it is very likely that if we look hard enough we will find many more new and previously unrecorded species of fungi right here on our doorstep
170085 this is a great shame but it does highlight the urgent need for detailed surveying of our fungal biodiversity so that we can give protection to rare and important species
170086 our studies show that the prominent learning genes are not playing any role in purely behavioral learning our results suggest that pavlovian learning somehow suppresses behavioral learning
170087 to find this out one would need equivalent studies in mice or rats
170088 previous attempts to find better ways of encouraging skin cell growth have used chemical additives and other elaborate techniques to produce scaffolds but their success has been limited weve found that skin cells are actually very smart its in their dna to sort themselves into the right arrangement they just need a comparatively uncomplicated scaffold and each other to help them grow in a safe natural way
170089 ultimately we can envisage treatment of burns victims and the undertaking of reconstructive surgery using the scaffold and the patients own skin to produce bespoke skin for that patient

170095 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
170096 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
170097 the mccain campaign was compelled to respond to this outrageous attack because we will not allow john mccain to be smeared by senator obama as a racist for offering legitimate criticism
170098 we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it incur with president clinton

170103 it is becoming increasingly clear that structural factors like the growth in global food demand can be reasonably expected to maintain prices at sustained levels over the medium term though substantially below the most recent price hikes
170104 reasons for current price pressures are unambiguous a combination of steadily increasing demand and lagging supply or production shortfall exacerbated by short term economic and policy factors

170113 you cant imagine what a humiliation this is we have been martyred by the procedures
170114 everybody perfectly understands that there is no time because this decision has been announced so late
170115 most importantly why are last years doping tests suddenly emerging as an issue one week before the start of the games
170116 the extent of the scandal could be comparable only to the loss of the us squad before the athens olympics but there is a crucial difference formally none of the girls has been caught using doping drugs or been involved in distributing them
170117 we hope that the situation improves to the extent that it permits extending our business ties
170118 the risk of abduction is still high and i well recall the months when we worried about german hostages in iraq and still worry these are factors that should not be ignored or glossed over

170136 i prayed a lot about it and felt real comfortable with arkansas and i talked to my parents about it
170137 everything seemed right moss has numerous family members in the state and his mother sarah is from bodcaw which is just outside of hope his father mickey is a southern arkansas graduate and coached at magnolia and hamburg before moving to texas
170138 i couldnt see myself sitting out a year without playing football it would be difficult early playing time was big moss recorded 142 tackles 14 for losses 5 sacks 4 forced fumbles 3 recovered fumbles and 1 interception last season at south garland
170139 ive known doug for many years starting when i recruited him to the university of northern iowa
170140 he competed for me and then went on to have great coaching stints at arkansas state and drake university
170141 i am really looking forward to working at the university of arkansas
170142 the razorbacks have a great track and field tradition that was started by coach john mcdonnell and im thrilled my family and i can be a part of it
170143 it feels good to be a difference maker in the offense
170144 whats great about this staff is if they see you being effective they keep coming back to you
170145 hes a talented guy we have to find ways to get him the ball we have to find ways to get him in the position where he can run after the catch because hes very hard to tackle
170146 hes a good blocker he doesnt have any problem doing that so between him and andrew davie i think we have two tight ends that can do a lot of different things
170147 i certainly feel like if you were to go to battle today they would be two of our strengths with the different ways we can utilize their talents
170148 it looks like it will be one of our better personnel packages
170149 coach pelphrey was at every game that a j played this summer
170150 even the baylor head coach was not there probably less than half the time i noticed conspicuously that a lot of the other head coaches were not at the games
170151 coach pelphrey made an all out effort to impress a j and his family on how badly he wants him to be a razorback crawford said espn national recruiting analyst bob gibbons described walton as the bestkept secret at point guard in america
170152 i showed what im capable of and i should be rated higher than im rated now
170153 i went up against some of the highly rated offensive linemen and i got the best of them
170154 ive looked at their facilities on the internet and i like what i saw
170155 it was pretty much touching bases seeing how theyre doing
170156 its just something that normally happens during the recruiting process
170157 its been a lot of driving and a lot of traveling
170158 everything seems whiter and brighter and i dont mean just the people who live here
170159 in oil amp gas space i think maybe one has to focus only on the exploration because if one sees the oil marketing companies though they maybe having the benefits of the reduction in the crude prices but that will only be curtailing their losses because still there has been non clarity in respect to the issue of oil bonds within the rbi has stopped trying for further oil bonds and all that so probably all those companies will continue to remain under pressure
170160 the refining margins of the standalone psu refineries has been quite good but that was more because of the stock value held by them which has got factored into the realisation of this quarter that again may not come so ultimately one is left only with the upstream companies so in that case there is cairn or maybe reliance industries very few stocks available in that segment because ongc cannot get placed in that category because of the subsidy being shared by them for which there have been no parameters refined or no basis having spelt out by the ministry
170161 one can ignore the automobiles because if you see the results probably they have not been as on the expected line if you first take a call on the interest sensitive sectors like maybe the banking my choice would be that they are on the preferred list of buying even coming on the capital goods probably they are on the preferred list of buying thirdly infrastructure or the realty sectors because if you have seen the performance of all the realty developers in fact that inspite of the fall in the topline the margin has been maintained so my call probably will be on these three sectors except that one can ignore the automobiles because probably the pain could be more in the time to come in those sectors so these are the broad sectors which constitute a huge or the heavy percentage in the index
170162 tea and sugar are having short term visibility of price rise which should ultimately reflect into the stock price movement maybe once they go up or rise by about 15 20 in next month or so probably they may cool off from there my long term call is not so robust or positive for both the commodities but then these two sectors can again be preferred so taking overall call these are the choices in this market
170163 in this sort of a market reliance communications performance has been very disappointing i think below rs 410 one could see a sharp slide possibly to round about rs 378 380 zone that is where i can see good support and i think possibly a lot of bargain hunting may emerge around that area so for those who are not able to get on to reliance communications and got caught in the midst of all that mtn deal etc may be i think rs 378 380 that could be a good reason possibly to start buying the stock
170164 jp associates this was one stock which had been underperforming for quite sometime but todays performance has been magnificent and i think this is not just a flash in the pan i could see jp associates moving upto the charts are indicating that this rally certainly could take it to the rs 195 198 zone
170165 as far as suzlon is concerned i am not so convinced as yet may be since i am expecting the nifty to rally to round about 4 700 zone and suzlon would also perform but i would at best dement as a sort of a still a market underperformer and therefore i would say that at best we could see another rs 40 50 movement for suzlon given the choice i would be trading in a stock like jp associates for the immediate term
170166 if you see the performance of eastern silk for fy08 if you break them into four quarters they had a similar kind of profitability of about rs 18 19 crore bottomline with a topline of about rs 125 130 crore but then the apprehension or the fear of the forex losses has started coming in which has rightly came in march quarter where they had losses so again market was apprehending the same kind of losses coming in or reported by the company for this quarter also which did not come the bottomline is to the extent of rs 19 crore obviously that includes rs 2 5 crore as the exchange gain which they have earlier provided for
170167 the best part is now there are no derivatives contracts outstanding which the company has clarified except for the forward contracts which are again related to the working of the company that is again if you have any mark to market losses obviously that gets compensated by higher realization in your topline revenue so taking this into consideration with a book value of close to rs 49 50 a share which has been subdivided to rs 2 now ruling at around rs 18 that makes or that qualifies a very good buy because ultimately if you see an eps of about 11 12 this used to be a very favored stock or maybe the preferred stock by the market so with the eps of about rs 10 11 or rs 12 on rs 2 face value obviously the stock looks quite good that probably the performance of the company will keep continuing in the same manner share is ruling much lower than its book value so i think the result of this company is also a hit

170191 das rekordergebnis f r das erste halbjahr best tigt unsere erwartung f r ergebniswachstum in 2008 im vergleich zum vorjahr
170192 allerdings steigen die kosten normalerweise wegen projektabschl ssen vor allem im vierten quartal nochmals
170193 gr nde f r den kostenr ckgang gegen ber dem vorjahresquartal sind niedrigere aufwendungen f r die aktienbasierte verg tung niedrigere abschreibungen sowie das im letzten jahr bekannt gegebene restrukturierungsprogramm
170194 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
170195 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
170196 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
170197 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
170198 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
170199 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
170200 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
170201 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
170202 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
170203 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
170204 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
170205 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
170206 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
170207 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
170208 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap
170209 they have to submit a cv curriculum vitae of their credentials be approved by the site editors and also confirm their e mail address when an article is posted it can be approved by an editor and this status is shown
170210 forgive me for being cynical but i dont believe mobileme is working properly for one second thank god i wasnt one of the 1 did apple get the enron accountants to come up with that figure who got totally screwed on email but i have had all the other woes people have reported over the past few weeks
170211 it simply stopped delivering about 50 of my messages for about two hours theyve never turned up today after the damn thing is supposed to be working i had a 30 minute period a few hours ago where mail kept demanding my password and wouldnt sign in to my imap internet message access protocol account
170212 mobileme has been working perfectly fine for me for the past week or more
170213 syncing between home the mobileme cloud and my work machine is dead
170214 i keep getting inconsistent data despite continually resetting removing restarting mobile me and sync over a number of days im hoping for a second free month from apple for this
170215 every type of publicity has some effect so how big a deal it is its not the end of the universe but its not helpful
170216 in terms of it being expected what you have to look at is apple has a larger and larger footprint in the market and many of its customers are new to computers and as it acquires more consumers its getting the less sophisticated types who dont know the things like on the first day of the service there will be lots of calls and the servers will be overtaxed sophisticated users will tend to know this but the newbies will complain and thatll create bad press
170217 this is the first stumble that apple has made in a pretty long while
170218 i feel that since coo tim cook arrived apple has been executing uncommonly well it could be that apple is seeing some of the limits of growth
170219 as long as nvidia manages good operations and improves in these areas theyve got a stunning range of products for many industries gaming gpus graphic processing units chipsets for pc and mac open gl has always been their strength so open gl or maybe open gl es plays to their advantage were talking physics physx which will probably be integrated into open cl cuda etc
170220 in the desktop portable and even mobile space nvidia has a lot to offer apple as long as quality control is maintained
170221 i dont know much about it but isnt that the point of android that its open source if they want an open source cell phone why dont they just use that
170222 oh right they think they are entitled to apples hardware

170225 the court has established that the accused nevzlin organised the execution of several especially serious crimes
170226 there is absolutely no basis to consider this trial fair from the very beginning nevzlin and his defence have been denied almost all their lawful rights
170227 i am fully satisfied with the verdict my husband was killed for doing his job
170228 the leadership of yukos and khodorkovsky himself constantly threatened him after khodorkovsky was arrested i was constantly threatened followed and bugged because i was a witness

170231 moreover the office assures its clients of the confidentiality of their personal records claimants shall present their id or other documents as a proof that they are authorized to receive the document
170232 the accused committed the crime with evident premediation and treachery when the accused stabbed his victim in the back
170233 tough guy and every time they met at ignacio street accused always asked him for money to buy liquor
170234 it gives you what the government wants you to know
170235 that reminds me i have to change my air conditioner filter i always change my filter on the first of the month
170236 it remains unclear whether the offer was made shortly after favre retired or when he began expressing a desire to play football again
170237 if the offer was made some might interpret it as the packers trying to buy off their hall of fame player
170238 theres a lot of controversies that i have eagerly leapt into in my time
170239 im not so dumb that im going to jump into that one we all agree that brett favre has provided america and the state of wisconsin with some of its greatest moments and i hope we keep that all in mind as we go forward
170240 brett favre theyre bribing him with 20 million to lie down whats next is he going to join the chicago democratic machine and run for alderman

170244 ik vind dat er geen franstalige minderheid bestaat in vlaanderen er zijn wel migranten die zich moeten aanpassen dat wordt ook gevraagd aan marokkanen en turken zij krijgen niet te horen jullie zijn talrijk het arabisch wordt een offici le taal dat zou al te gek zijn nergens in de wereld zou men dergelijke logica aanvaarden
170245 iedereen is welkom in vlaanderen men kan er frans blijven spreken het enige wat wij vragen is dat de offici le taal het nederlands is
170246 en aangezien dat het kind van belgi is moeten de twee ouders zich erover ontfermen
170247 men kan er frans of west vlaams blijven spreken het enige wat wij vragen is dat de offici le taal het nederlands is

170249 the fuselage of the plane rolled through our group and subsequently caused massive injuries to all involved
170250 my first reaction was to hit the ground and then after receiving minor injuries i went into rescue and help mode to aid my fellow paratroopers
170251 there was a split second delay to process what we were witnessing and then all of us picked a direction and ran
170252 my feet carried me along the line of mock doors when two seconds later i found myself on fire
170253 at some point i realized i had to drop and did my best to smother the flames i thought incorrectly
170254 i never knew who he was and had never seen him again until recently
170255 i came to his office because i needed his signature to get a bamc identification card
170256 since the day of the accident i have only been able to give a heartfelt thanks to all those folks who were involved with my health care
170257 to actually find one of the first responders is a rare gift
170258 hero and heroic are words that i would choose to describe sgt maj whelan a real hero doesnt know hes a hero and that will always be true
170259 a real hero is one who has to be told that he is one even though he doesnt believe it
170260 it scarred me to see my brothers killed in front of me and although i helped many that day to see how fragile life is made me feel helpless but also gave me a different perspective on the importance of being a good medic and more importantly a better human being
170261 i still wonder what if how could i have done things better they say what doesnt kill you makes you stronger thats a lie what doesnt kill you makes you more aware of how precious life is
170262 i have been told that im a hero before and i have a hard time accepting it
170263 i think all soldiers if put in that situation would hopefully react to save their brothers and sisters regardless of danger
170264 i never thought i would see any of the folks that i physically put hands on but to this day i have a hard time dealing with that day meeting and sharing with staff sgt scharmen has not only been a good experience but also a healing experience
170265 i was able to live that is the primary consequence as a result of living i was able to meet my wife jenny whom ive been married 12 years
170266 ive been able to serve honorably in different capacities within the army and just lately as a liaison helping soldiers in whatever way i can
170267 am i doing everything i possibly can to support our soldiers serving today
170268 we knew it would be extremely challenging but also an honor to take it on
170269 were pioneering something here that will make it easier in the future for other warriors in transition
170270 the standards are high so the challenge has been how to integrate the warriors in transition so they can successfully meet those standards taking into account their physical capabilities
170271 i was combat arms before and cant do my job anymore
170272 i thought this would be a good opportunity to get back into a learning environment and also help my army career
170273 at the hospital i havent really seen anything military since before i got injured
170274 it gives me a sense of pride that no one can take away
170275 this course is a way to get back into the nco mode
170276 when i get promoted leadership should be a smooth transition
170277 they have a multitude of experiences they can share with those soldiers who have yet to deploy
170278 the warriors in transition have life experience and can bring a different perspective to the table they are living proof of the importance of leadership which is exactly what we strive to teach
170279 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
170280 we have the right plan for gm driven by great products building strong brands fuel economy technology leadership and taking full advantage of global growth opportunities
170281 the 11th circuit seems to understand that christian student groups cannot be singled out for discrimination the right to associate with people of like mind and interest applies to all student groups on a public university campus
170282 we are confident that the court will not allow the university of florida to continue to deprive byx of this right by forcing the group to abandon its identity as a christian mens organization

170287 in america we must tolerate these acts even if this would never be accepted in islamic societies
170288 in fact they have become very effective missionaries for islam in the western world
170289 we will see much more of this in the future
170290 this advertising blitz is only one of an expected barrage of missionary advertising in the future
170291 i have no problem with the ad itself but i have a very very real problem with those behind it
170292 people try to make the connection as if im endorsing some bad deeds that were done by sheik abdel rahman

170295 im excited to have the chance to wear the red white and blue and represent my country
170296 after the u s olympic trials i said how excited i was to keep training and improving this gives me that chance i wont have to wait until next spring to do another heptathlon this is going to be fun
170297 this is a great honor for liz and our track program
170298 she is gaining so much valuable experience this summer between the trials and now the thorpe cup her senior season next spring should prove to be something very special and she deserves everything that is coming to her she is one of the hardest working most dedicated athletes ive ever coached
170299 i remember alan keyes i remember him using this in his campaign against me
170300 to provide age appropriate sex education science based sex education in schools
170301 it sets up a system of cooperation and networking between different agencies
170302 they are really trying to set the next team up to walk in the door and have a functioning government and they are doing it in a way thats workable for a republican or democrat
170303 all it basically does is bring the old executive order up to date with new structure which is necessary but it doesnt fundamentally change anything beyond that
170304 cannot be seen as anything other than an attempt to undercut congressional oversight
170305 after seven years of a go it alone presidency perhaps i should expect nothing more from this white house
170306 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
170307 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
170308 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
170309 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
170310 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
170311 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
170312 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
170313 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
170314 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
170315 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
170316 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
170317 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
170318 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
170319 it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all of the agencys legal requirements
170320 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
170321 the question is can india end safeguards if fuel supplies are interrupted even if theyve conducted a nuclear test or does the agreement require permanent unconditional safeguards
170322 threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent
170323 this is yet another example of the medias promotion of
170324 i will tell you something that i will not permit you to record
170325 i havent heard anything negative at least not to my face
170326 i think that its sure to be an eye opener for mobile
170327 while age old traditions should be kept we should also keep up with the times
170328 there should be some events where both organizations are participants

170334 they are trying to inflame people by making up these falsehoods about kids
170335 is not primarily about marriage it is about inserting into the law the principle that sexual orientation should be treated exactly the same way we treat race in law and culture the next step will be to use the law to stigmatize marginalize and repress those who disagree with the governments new views on marriage and sexual orientation
170336 were willing to challenge the injustice and contradictions of this
170337 its because everyone on tv everyone talks about it so much
170338 not yet extinguished desire of hostile forces to exterminate us
170339 too often in mining internal migration house demolition the rights of the population are violated
170340 in solving these conflicts and controlling mass unrest some officials are violence prone their methods too careless including the way they employ the police
170341 how can we avoid corruption when the party takes over
170342 do we have democracy when did we have it can you sirs who wave maos portrait really tell me when we had democracy
170343 the top of the ancient walls which were touched by the collapse of the roof were damaged
170344 also i was assured that this new structure would last three hundred years resist 10 richter scale earthquakes and 60 inches 130cm of snow but it couldnt even support its own weight
170345 i am annoyed for the last three years i havent been able to work on the site i have not even been given full access to the site the contractors have told me that i can enter at my own risk but they cant guarantee the structures stability obviously it would be irresponsible for me to take other archaeologists in there
170346 it is one of the most important sites in the world closed because of poor planning i feel bad because its as though we cannot handle a site of such importance its bad for business yes but it is also bad for the island in many other ways
170347 but now the ministry is powerless in the face of bureaucracy not only internal but also external the eu central archaeological council and government have the power to veto and interfere no one is happy that it is closed but what are we to do
170348 it will take generations and generations for us just to investigate the roofed area alone
170349 but the sites we have excavated have been luxurious which makes it likely that there remain other areas outside the roofed one that were not luxurious in truth we do not know
170350 greece is a very small country and has a limited budget and very many sites and monuments that are of first class importance
170351 its a building that does not try to ape anything
170352 the idea was not to make a building that would speak for itself in a certain manner
170353 it doesnt show as having a certain style its a shell that houses some very important exhibits
170354 it was a frieze to be seen by the gods and now weve brought it down so humans can see it
170355 so we pass through the parts that have been destroyed forever
170356 i hope visitors will see what they havent seen before
170357 its going to be an important building you will see

170426 hey hoboken411 i am still in england doing my soccer thing but my friend today told me something i couldnt keep in she was waiting for the path today to go to the city for her job and she dropped her path card on the rail tracks she apparently thought that path card was precious so she jumped down on the tracks to get it in full work outfit little did she know that 2 cops were watching the whole thing and quickly gave her a ticket not really sure what the ticket would be for though maybe the stupidest way to get yourself critically injured she was very upset but i figure to cheer her up by exploiting her die hard committment not to lose the pathcard
170427 an easy choice to make what philippe did was incredibly beautiful
170428 it may have been illegal but it was not in any way destructive it would be unfair and wrong to infect his story with any mention discussion or imagery of the towers being destroyed everyone knows what happened to those buildings
170429 if you were there at the time and had to choose between who was going to survive the longest you certainly would have chosen the towers
170430 i think it is possible to enjoy those buildings for the duration of the film hopefully without that enjoyment being too infected by an awareness of their destruction
170431 very intense and emotional a lot of people were very moved i think because of what the film evoked of new york in a different era
170432 i came out to do a question and answer session introducing philippe who was hiding at the back of the cinema
170433 he came bounding down and sir sean connery who was in the audience led what was essentially a standing ovation
170434 sir sean then got up and said it was one of the three best films he had ever seen
170435 it was one of the best moments of my life and a wonderful moment for all of us
170436 next week the president will summon state minister for national development planning paskah suzetta and forestry minister m s kaban
170437 i personally gave the money to paskah in four installments as for m s kaban i gave him rp 300 million
170438 i was informed last night the appeal of the medan prosecutors was accepted
170439 without realizing it my kids have tutored me on how to integrate faith and learning in ways i could never have imagined
170440 great ideas should not just inhabit classrooms they should permeate our lives
170441 the disposition to trust god as demonstrated in ones earnestly following god as much as one can relative to ones understanding of him
170442 while it may typically be such that those who are saved by god do come to have explicit faith it doesnt follow that it always works this way
170443 if a kid is mature enough to ask as substantive question we figure they are mature enough to handle a truthful response
170444 ti rendo lode viscontessa signora del web e della blogsfera perch hai nascosto queste cose ai sapienti e ai dotti e le hai rivelate ai piccoli s o viscontessa perch cos hai deciso nella tua benevolenza tutto stato dato a me dalla viscontessa mia nessuno conosce i blog se non la viscontessa e nessuno conosce viscontessa se non i blogger e coloro ai quali i blogger vorranno rivelarlo venite a me voi tutti che siete stanchi e oppressi e io vi dar ristoro prendete io donna del corriere della sera di domani e imparate da me che sono mite e umile di cuore e troverete ristoro per la vostra vita il mio blog infatti dolce e il mio peso leggero

170450 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently
170451 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 of the problem the rest we can deal with
170452 we intend to continue operating the directory business as a complement to our national canadian platform of directories

170454 infection is the number one risk for women who wax in a salon if proper sanitation isnt applied during the waxing procedure this may include bacterial infection or a viral sexually transmitted disease such as human papillomavirus hpv and herpes simplex virus hsv
170455 women can also develop skin infections just days after the procedure including cellulitis a diffuse reddish skin infection folliculitis infected hair follicles or abscess a localized collection of pus buried under the skin the exposed labia are also more susceptible to trauma exposing the vagina and urethra to infections as well
170456 as with all waxing treatments the skin is temporarily left in a vulnerable state where the pores are open
170457 keep in mind that pubic hair is there for a purpose to protect the genital area from infection and trauma
170458 the thong is like a little subway car the bacteria goes from the rectum to the vagina and to the bladder normal healthy patients shouldnt really be impacted by this but anyone who is predisposed may have an increased incidence

170539 the success of their investment will depend largely on how well they can protect their investment from their own personal interests
170540 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
170541 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
170542 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
170543 within the context of a very difficult operating environment ba management is doing all the right things
170544 it is managing fares up cutting capacity and seeking strategic tie ups that will provide future synergies that will allow it to inch its way back to economic returns

170570 its really a race against time once the whale is in the water we dont have much control over it and it will go where it wants to
170571 it has been in the area for a couple of days which is not good it means it will be already dehydrated and very very hungry
170572 it wont have eaten for a couple of days because theres no squid and it feeds on squid in the deep water
170573 it may have come off course because it is sick or it may just have got disorientated we dont know why these things happen
170574 the trouble is the minute they get out of the water because of the weight of the body it starts to compress all its organs so you then get a build up of toxins
170575 vets will look at it because it is so off course even if we can get it back to sea it will still have no foodstuff so the vets will be making some very tough decisions

170588 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
170589 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with

170597 it looks a bit odd to be shrinking on the one hand and calling for a third runway with the other if they end up making further cuts in subsequent seasons the effect will be to undermine bas case
170598 it does not undermine the case at all none of the cuts we are making are going to reduce the number of slots we have at heathrow it will not diminish the argument for a third runway in the slightest
170599 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
170600 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
170601 this movie felt like a breeze i think maybe just because they made it so easy and fun really i cant believe that you can have that much fun making a movie and actually make a good movie

170634 takes us one very important step closer to providing every child in massachusetts with the lifelong benefits of strong educational beginnings
170635 its a terrible constraint on the citys budget and so its unfortunate that he did veto it
170636 the city came to us to see if there was some recourse for it within the federal budget and we looked very hard but there is no place for it to fall
170637 on the third deployment 20 percent of those deployed are likely to develop ptsd

170639 trooper mcgreals behavior was extreme and outrageous exceeding all norms of decency and civility
170640 were seeing this across the country where officers are taking immigration law which they dont know anything about into their own hands
170641 i dont think this was any kind of cold blooded incident
170642 things are not quite as its been spun in the papers
170643 all of the facts and circumstances surrounding this case remain under investigation but our witnesses have led us to believe that the children and their mother were taken against their will
170644 what is so bittersweet about this is that this woman cared so much for this woman and her family she was willing to take that risk and unfortunately was murdered
170645 we would hope people would not be completely dissuaded from helping a friend and help them connect to a local program
170646 its an incredible thing that her friend did for her its just a tragedy that this mother is now gone and four children are now left without their mother

170758 when i talk to heads they say behaviour is one of their main concerns some talk of giving detentions to pupils only for the parent to come in and demand their child is let off
170759 so whilst the vast majority of parents work really well with schools a small minority are not supporting heads to maintain discipline

170783 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
170784 it doesnt matter how he hurts you with his hands or with his words you dont deserve it it aint worth it take your heart and run

170796 we wanted this player at least for the next two months and hopefully longer so were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
170797 i think people for some reason think hes lazy and a bad teammate and that he doesnt care
170798 hes none of the above does he do some goofy things absolutely he does do some goofy things but as far as preparation and knowing the game and wanting to win theres no way you put up those numbers year in and year out unless youre a special talent and work at it and he does both
170799 its nice to see weve done something like this to make a push for the next two months
170800 hell be just fine manny is really a simple person he works extremely hard he just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family how can you not respect and love a guy like that
170801 theo reached out to me in midmorning and wanted to gauge our interest and i said you know what we have an interest then we probably spent the next two plus hours hammering it out this wasnt on the board for very long
170802 manny being manny can also mean hell hit a lot of home runs and drive in a lot of runs
170803 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
170804 mannys certainly not a simple personality thats for sure hes complex but ive seen him when he competes

170808 were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
170809 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
170810 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
170811 hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
170812 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
170813 its a good deal for pittsburgh they got four good players
170814 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
170815 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
170816 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us

170867 we continue to see strong customer momentum in key growth areas of our business

170869 we delivered gross margin of 43 1 per cent the seventh consecutive quarter of year over year improvement

170876 look what george w or the republicans or the democrats have given me
170877 i get a letter this one from my congresswoman the first was from the irs telling me how wonderful it is that i am getting a stimulus
170878 the costs for implementing the economic stimulus legislation may be up to 862 million irs received a supplemental appropriation of 202 million for implementing the economic stimulus legislation the social security administration received a supplemental of 31 million and the financial management service received a supplemental of 64 million the reallocation of hundreds of irs collections staff to answering taxpayer telephone calls will also result in up to 565 million in foregone enforcement revenue according to irs estimates
170879 administering the stimulus payments is likely to cost the agency and the u s treasury much more than all our spending of the checks will recoup rebates push deficit to record highs
170880 the economic stimulus payments which qualify more or less as
170881 demand for telephone assistance related to the economic stimulus legislation has been unprecedented according to irs for the week ending may 24 volume was almost six times greater than the same week last year despite reallocating staff from collections work to answering stimulus related calls the percent of callers waiting to speak with an assistor who got through has declined markedly to 39 percent for the week ending may 24 compared to 80 percent for the same week last year
170882 the rebate check approach was created with the hopes that consumers would increase their spending on goods and services
170883 but as gas prices keep rising american families have been pouring their stimulus money into their gas tanks
170884 these checks cost the irs a fortune created tons of confusion and resulted in millions of errors on 2008 tax returns and it is doubtful that they did anything to stimulate the economy

170912 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
170913 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
170914 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
170915 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
170916 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
170917 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
170918 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
170919 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1

170942 i think its impossible for us to not be influenced by our other creations
170943 theres a lot of back and forth between the two games and i dont think theres anything wrong with that
170944 we look at world of warcraft and the art style there is more cartoony than we wanted but in terms of target identification and having a world that feels like you can move through it and spend lots of time in it theres a lot of elements to the art style that really work
170945 we wanted an art style that really feels like blizzard and we pull new influences from a lot of areas i think people over emphasize the world of warcraft comparison but are we influenced by world of warcraft of course as i think anyone who makes games nowadays they have to be

170957 the anc reiterates its view that the manner in which this case has been handled by the authorities in the past few years has reinforced the perception that the anc president is being persecuted rather than merely prosecuted it has also fuelled doubts about his chances of receiving a fair hearing
170958 the constitutional court was not a trial court and so no causal link or inference is to be established
170959 what we are saying is the manner in which the constitutional court conducted itself doesnt inspire confidence moreover the ruling on attorney client privilege dumps sa into a constitutional jungle with grave implications
170960 we have in the past recorded our displeasure at the impact of the manner in which the constitutional court managed the complaint against western cape judge president john hlophe

171005 ill be looking to build on rob howleys work and look to tweak the attacking side of things
171006 i was quite fussy which european club i wanted to join added 38 year old millard
171007 i saw them play four or five years ago and i liked the vibe and the culture at the arms park
171008 you recycle you choose organic you conserve energy now take at home environmentalism to the next level
171009 everything ive said about a mother raising a child alone applies to a father raising a child alone
171010 it looks like youre not going to get that green card after all the marriage wasnt exactly on the books if you know what i mean but who the fuck are they to tell us what love is right
171011 your visa has you here for another two months but i figured since this is going to have to end anyways we might as well bite the bullet and move on with our lives i booked you a flight for tomorrow at five okay dont look so glum bunny weve got to be realistic about this theres no point crying over spilt milk
171012 each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children
171013 the competition for places is great and we need that in the premier league
171014 when it comes to possibly selling players you can never say never although us managers are greedy and you never really like to let anyone go
171015 sometimes you accept an offer which is good for the club and the player but i hope not to be doing that too often
171016 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
171017 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
171018 we felt it was very important he came with us
171019 but hopefully the lads will help him get over it
171020 i said i will change the way i speak to the players because they are one year older and are more conscious of what they have to do
171021 then i hope this season will be the good one
171022 in addition i know some english players did criticise me after the game with birmingham trying to make of me responsible for this defeat 2 2 draw and i though they exaggerated
171023 the only thing i can say is that we could have won there and when you want to be champion you have to keep in mind that those games make the difference
171024 the deal fell through simply because we couldnt come to an agreement with his agent on personal terms
171025 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal
171026 it is difficult for us to take a decision but arsenal is certainly something that gokhan needs to look at
171027 sebastiens got good experience but i think hes one for the future
171028 we had him for a week so we knew about him the big thing was having him for a week if wed not been able to have him we probably wouldnt have done it
171029 but we had him in saw him around the players and saw his standard then having the chance to play to him convinced me it was one we should do
171030 were improving that layer just behind the first team with players who can jump in and hes certainly one of those
171031 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery
171032 the past few years now we havent been getting the results that we wanted
171033 we havent played the best football and we have not selected the best players that this country has
171034 its more about who you play for or who you are rather than your form when the national team is selected
171035 i think that if you play for certain teams then you get selected even though youre not good enough or not on form
171036 its a massive shame its a big embarrassment for the players and the country but things never seem to change
171037 there has been a lot of speculation but thats all it is
171038 i want to get back in the premier league but if i stay here then i will work my butt off to get reading back in the top flight
171039 he is a great example of what we try to do with our internship program
171040 the internship was basically like a three month test both for me and for hp
171041 i saw the dress code was relaxed and i thought this is ok
171042 i like idaho and the pleasure of working with great engineers
171043 to continually build our pipeline of top talent we are trying to be very aggressive on campuses not only with our brand and our products but also with the relationships we establish
171044 fostering the internship program helps us cultivate these relationships seek out the best of the best and ultimately develop our key talent to be the future leaders of the company
171045 only a very small percentage of the notebook chips that have shipped are potentially affected and the problem depends on a combination of environmental conditions configuration and usage model
171046 this is not an action that i take lightly i understand that this will affect people at a time when they are already struggling and so i want to apologise to all the state employees for having to do that
171047 the payment rates and policies adopted in this final rule will make it possible for beneficiaries who are severely impaired by illness or injury but who are able to participate in an intensive program of rehabilitation to obtain high quality care in an inpatient setting
171048 the rule cms is adopting today will help to ensure that people with medicare have access to rehabilitation services that are appropriate to their medical conditions and that will help them reach their maximum level of recovery as quickly as possible
171049 some people in public health have organ donation in the forefront of their lives we encourage public health employees to sign up for organ donation i had a brother who died in a car accident by the time he arrived at the hospital and the ability to contact my sister in law for his wishes the only organ left to donate was his corneas his eyes made it possible for that person to see the reality of another individual being able to continue life in a normal capacity due to transplantation is phenomenal
171050 yes means you have decided to give organs and tissues after your death to people who urgently need a transplant the title organ donor and a red heart will appear on the lower right corner of your drivers license if you decide to become an organ donor after you have been issued your license you can obtain an organ donor sticker to place on the license to indicate your decision stickers can be obtained from your local probate office
171051 the successful implementation of part 2 of the act represented a very significant reform of the manner in which mental health services in ireland are provided to the most vulnerable in society those who are unable to decide about their care and who in the past may have been unfairly deprived of their liberty
171052 cot death is still the leading cause of death in babies over one month old in the uk today to reduce the especially high risk of cot death among babies who were born prematurely they must be slept on their backs at home hospitals need to start placing babies to sleep on their backs several weeks before they are ready to go home so parents see medical staff doing this and understand why studies 4 have shown that parents are strongly influenced by what they see doctors and nurses doing
171053 many parents worry that if their baby sleeps on their back they are more likely to choke on their vomit but research 5 shows this isnt true another concern parents have is that reflux will get worse if their baby sleeps on their back but again research 6 shows that this doesnt happen parents also worry that their premature baby wont sleep well if they are lying on their back and research does show that they do wake less if they are sleeping on their tummies however parents must not be tempted to let their babies sleep on their fronts as babies who wake up less are more vulnerable to cot death
171054 this is an extremely important campaign considering that 80 000 babies are born premature or sick in the uk every year and that these babies are at a very high risk of cot death the best quality care should always be delivered to these most vulnerable babies turning babies on their backs to sleep both in the latter stages of their stay on a special care baby unit and then at home is a simple step that can make a crucial difference
171055 over the last ten years there has been a large increase in the number of prescription items supplied to patients by the nhs this is particularly the case for prescriptions supplied to elderly patients where the average number of items per person has almost doubled
171056 we are very gratified that cerepro has demonstrated efficacy in this multi centre phase iii gene therapy study this is in keeping with our experience and expectation of the product and we now have further evidence to show cerepro r has an anti cancer effect our next steps are to complete the full analysis and meet with our emea rapporteur to determine the way forward
171057 this is the first gene therapy product to successfully reach its primary endpoint in a major phase iii trial with a number of patients in the trial still to report an event there is a substantial amount of further information to come and we will update the analysis after the turn of the year in parallel with our regulatory activities malignant glioma is one of the most aggressive of all human diseases and to have seen a positive effect for cerepro r in this disease area is very encouraging arks adenoviral delivery technology has the potential to deliver a new era of gene based therapies for acute and chronic human disease
171058 the shoes should help me improve my swing and ill be able to walk the tournaments now
171059 it got to a point where he couldnt keep up
171060 it was such a relief to know what it was and what we were dealing with
171061 this young girls feet were twisted and deformed like the limbs of an old oak tree
171062 this was the kind of deformity a 90 year old might develop not a healthy adolescent it made quite an impression
171063 there were definitely feelings of frustration he just couldnt keep up
171064 dr pfeffer answered our questions the way wed hoped and we had total confidence he could do the surgery
171065 i can tell her what cmt is all about and help her through it
171066 there are a large number of americans with cmt who sit at home dont go to high school dances dont play sports dont get jobs all because they dont know what can be done for them
171067 when you take away the burden of cmt these young people finally begin to fly
171068 knowing the primary tumor site with greater certainty enables more appropriate cancer treatment the growing trend in cancer care is the use of therapies that target specific tissues and their genomic components rather than relying on a one size fits all treatment approach
171069 we believe the pathwork tissue of origin test will help provide more certainty in tumor diagnosis which will enable more patients to realize the benefits of this new era in genomics based diagnostics
171070 they are time consuming and frustrating for both physicians and patients accurately identifying a tumors origin and thus knowing what kind of cancer the patient has is necessary for beginning standard of care cancer specific treatment per the national comprehensive cancer network clinical practice guidelines knowing the tumors origin can also enable patients to get into and benefit from appropriate clinical trials
171071 traditional tools used to identify tumors of uncertain origin include imaging studies such as ct scans and mris as well as a thorough pathological evaluation with immunohistochemistry and other techniques
171072 however for difficult cases the use of these complex iterative techniques can often take weeks and in some cases they still do not definitively identify the tissue of origin a gene expression test like the pathwork tissue of origin test provides unique information and based on this data it is reasonable to expect that it will improve the diagnosis of uncertain primary tumors
171073 preoperative or neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to improve survival local control and operability in a variety of tumors including breast cancer in some cases preoperative therapy is imperative to achieve local control whereas in other instances the indication for preoperative therapy is less strong
171074 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive
171075 understanding how these bacteria thrive within us is a critical element of learning how to defeat them
171076 its amazing that the bacteria could learn to extract iron from their environment in this way
171077 we went into these experiments with no idea that this mechanism existed but then bacteria have to be creative to survive in some very hostile environments and theyve had maybe 3 5 billion years to figure it out
171078 tb bacteria have access to an abundant supply of iron citrate flowing through the lungs in the blood
171079 finding a way to sneak iron from humans at no energy cost to the bacteria is as good as it gets our discovery may enable others to figure out a way to limit tbs access to iron citrate making the bacteria more vulnerable to drug treatment
171080 ours will no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation we have stood up
171081 the occupation of hong kong was the epitome of the humiliation that china suffered in modern history

171084 hiv develops resistance very rapidly and once that happens drugs dont work as well as they theoretically should or they stop working altogether
171085 physicians routinely have the patients virus tested for resistance in advance of treatment to help make the appropriate clinical decisions
171086 the focus has been on specific areas of the hiv genome where we expect these resistance conferring mutations to occur
171087 we focus on a particular sequence on an important gene from amino acid 1 to 300 and as such we miss roughly a third of this gene until recently most researchers believed that this hidden area was of little clinical significance
171088 the mechanism about how these mutations could be involved in resistance was not clear however in our paper we present data that explains in considerable detail how these mutations work
171089 its extremely time consuming and expensive to validate genotype testing
171090 however we probably will be testing these areas in a couple of years

171092 undeniably low maternal vitamin d affects the way the brain develops
171093 over the past four years weve been able to show that low vitamin d intake in animals during pregnancy results in offspring with brain abnormalities similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia
171094 the danes are only able to give us 1 6 microlitres of plasma so weve had to come up with a method of determining the vitamin d levels in that tiny amount of blood institute of molecular bioscience weve developed a way to easily measure low levels of vitamin d using mass spectrometry
171095 if we establish the link in this huge patient cohort we will be able to show that having low maternal vitamin d does not necessarily mean a child is going to develop schizophrenia but if a child has a particularly vulnerable genome the low maternal vitamin d may be the environmental trigger
171096 its the combination of gene and environment which triggers the disease

171106 sexuality is too big an issue to decide at something like this
171107 the majority think it homosexuality is an abnormality i agree with that view
171108 we have discussed homosexuality so much i had some more important things to do
171109 to be honest were just too tired for any of that
171110 i had a bishop in the back of my cab the other day and he told me weve made a decision were only going to have sex on tuesdays

171112 there will be no mention of condom or safe sex in the revised module on life skill education program but we will be focusing on the aspirations of the youngsters and will also talk about being faithful to ones partner and abstinence there should be no hypocrisy on the subject

171122 programmes that exclusively promote abstinence do not reduce the risk of hiv infection
171123 in uganda the african country that has been most successful in lowering hiv prevalence surveys have documented an increase in risky sexual behaviours in recent years
171124 they frequently fail to sustain safer behaviours for longer periods
171125 our 25 member prevention committee put faithfulness and abstinence into the national strategic plan repeatedly foreign advisers erased our recommendations when the document draft was published fidelity and abstinence were missing
171126 had the financial power to force their casual sex agendas upon us

171263 to be frank i wish to say that at the moment in xinjiang there are only a limited number of sabotage activities by east turkestan forces or groups
171264 these terrorists groups are not at all as capable as some media organisations have said
171265 a very small number of sabotage activities and many of them have been stopped in the early days
171266 with our experience in dealing with terrorists especially the east turkestan islamic movement over the past years we are confident that we can thwart any terrorist activities in time

171611 the government believes that the number of cyberspace activists most of whom are not affiliated with political parties is growing steadily what really worries them is that these young activists are ordinary people who have the potential to organise a demonstration or a strike
171612 the authorities have clamped down on the 6 april activists because they are terrified of the idea that ordinary people without any political party affiliation are developing the potential to instigate political action even the phrase 6 april youth is enough to ruffle the feathers of the government the security apparatus clearly believes that this kind of opposition has the ability to incite people to demonstrate thats why they hit them hard in alexandria where they were just flying a kite with an egyptian flag attached to it

171628 heres a typical scenario that happens at other hosting providers a new client signs up for a dedicated server the server is setup and email recipients have problems receiving mail because the previous user of the ip space assigned to the client was black listed for spamming we developed ipensure to handle this problem
171629 ipensure is a proprietary tool that we developed in house to serve in quality assurance processes during server provisioning ipensure is directly integrated into our advanced automatic server provisioning system and will guarantee that new clients ip addresses are completely clean free of any black listings before they are ever allocated to a new server
171630 we studied the problem and built a solution that resolves it ipensure is a vital level of quality to place in our auto provisioning process because it prevents problems from occurring beforehand leap is designed to allow for quick delivery of products and this is one step that weve taken to ensure that our clients are immediately ready to go with the server they want free of hassle
171631 to have achieved record second quarter sales and our second highest quarterly sales performance ever in the face of this difficult economic environment is a testimony to the soundness of the transformational strategy we put in place ten quarters ago clearly our efforts to dramatically reshape our global footprint by expanding our international manufacturing base is paying off handsomely as we have seen strong sales of crisa our mexican product line and in our libbey china glassware
171632 similarly we are quite pleased with the relative strength of our total north american glass business performance which continues to aggressively combat unprecedented natural gas and electricity costs we are seeing the benefits of our lean manufacturing efforts while continuing to provide the quality and service our customers have come to expect from libbey
171633 as the result of our performance to date including ebitda within our previous guidance and expectations for ongoing energy cost pressure we now anticipate full year 2008 ebitda to be in the range of 114 million to 118 million on expected sales of slightly more than 870 million

171642 explorer has been is and always will be committed to providing independent insurance agents with high quality well priced insurance so they can offer great coverage and value to their customers
171643 weve built the new explorer brand around the idea of linking our success to the success of our agents and brokers and by increasing available coverage limits and designing our preferred program with a great deal of flexibility weve taken a major step to advance our agents growth by enabling them to offer the truly customized coverage florida motorists need
171644 at explorer we not only value partnership we fundamentally understand that our success depends on the success of our agent partners
171645 we made a deliberate decision to launch our new florida offering with the new explorer brand to show how we will defy the conventions of the insurance category with breakthrough simplicity in both appearance and practice weve built our business and brand around the belief that the guidance of an experienced agent can really help motorists understand their options and obtain the right coverage at the best possible price were confident that our new preferred program offers compelling value to agents and insureds alike
171646 working with insurance companies on branding can be quite challenging because carriers are understandably risk averse
171647 not explorer its unequivocal promise of profound partnership with independent agents gave us a tremendous foundation to help build the explorer brand in alignment with its business strategy and to develop a new logo and look that is elegant and engaging yet completely unexpected among peer institutions

171655 while this mergers and acquisitions environment is encouraging for continued industry prosperity it poses challenges for firm owners in their attempts to understand and take advantage of the opportunities that arise the terms of the most successful transactions in any given situation are shaped by the characteristics of the individual firm and by the business and personal preferences of its owners
171656 never before has the independent registered investment advisory marketplace experienced such a high volume of transactions and had so many options for structuring deals the transaction environment we are experiencing is characterized by a rapidly rising level of market liquidity as a result firms can now grow and develop in ways that were previously unimaginable
171657 once they are here the opportunity is easy to understand
171658 they invest in vacation property or a second home then they start spending more personal time here they begin to realize they can work from here bring their skills here and become part of the growth that is happening soon they start spending a majority of their time in costa rica and then look to moving here full time they love it and so do we
171659 i estimate we are in the first 20 percent of the cycle of growth here
171660 if you take other coastal resort areas like hawaii or cancun as a model you find development expands after major hotels are in operation in this region more than a dozen hotel projects have been announced with key flagships like the four seasons in place already with more visitors more people fall in love with the area and want to come here and live
171661 our team consists of the people who developed the four seasons the top service providers in latin america definitely in costa rica its a great costa rican team not a foreign team they know how to work here they have the contacts and the track record theyve already done it
171662 we wanted to build a resort community that would allow our investors to live here year round and totally enjoy the day to day lifestyle at the same time if an owner plans only to vacation here and wants to rent his property out for the rest of the year we wanted to make that easy for them too our goal was to create a community and the amenity set that would inspire anyone who visits this area to want to stay at coco bay estates because of all that it offers
171663 there arent too many places in the world where you can go to the beach go to the rainforest go surfing visit a volcano go atving hiking or play in waterfalls all in the same day and then go home to a community that is comfortable safe and in what we call affordable luxury

171671 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
171672 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
171673 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
171674 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
171675 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
171676 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
171677 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
171678 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
171679 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

171684 for weeks afterwards you hardly saw a child on the street
171685 nobody would let their kids out it was so quiet and it is still that way people go into their home now and lock the door you dont see people yapping on the street like you used to
171686 i think people feel safer there are fewer arguments in the street now
171687 there would be no point in her moving back into the ferry
171688 i dont think people are scared living here but they are angry about what happened

171699 it doesnt matter that dinamo bucharest have sent the money
171700 in order for any deal to be done we want the whole package the paperwork a letter from marius and the money however we are still waiting on the document that states marius agrees to the conditions of the deal until that happens he is still our player
171701 its absolutely ludicrous that dinamo put official documents regarding the deal on their website telling people he had signed when thats not the case
171702 from our point of view the only hold up is from marius himself but should dinamo play him on sunday then they will be in trouble as we still hold his registration
171703 i think the two clubs agreed a fee but the sticking point was the players situation and thats why a deal wont be done until thats resolved
171704 he seems to want it all ways but sometimes you dont get that i think the club could have got more money from kaiserslautern but he wanted to go back home
171705 its up to him if he wants to come back here should the deal fall through however well worry about that if and when it happens
171706 i spoke to john rudge this morning thursday who is the director of football at stoke city and im just waiting on him to come back to me
171707 i certainly hope a deal can be done before the first game of the season as hes a young striker who is hungry to succeed
171708 of the fitz james horse it is known that they were from the regular french army and made up of french and franco scots their first language was french but their surnames as celtic as the peats
171709 i started to think about the repercussions of the creation of that flag the israeli flag fills me with fear because it is associated with so many war crimes and here it was outside a place where so many appalling atrocities had been committed
171710 you cant inflict human suffering on others because of the suffering you have gone through i wanted to come to some sort of understanding of that
171711 it was a very troubled unjust history and i realised how little i and most people knew about what really took place
171712 i decided i wanted to do a very big project on it and it had to be a monumental project otherwise it would be quite ridiculous for a scottish artist to work away in a london flat i released then that i had to move to the area
171713 they had to be given a soul a life and i realised that could only happen if they were made by palestinians
171714 it was important that as far as possible very figure had an identity and was made in the image of a real person either dead or alive who fled from their homeland in 1948
171715 i was interviewing people from 1948 who were on the move from one war and one devastated camp to another
171716 they are very philosophical they are also very polite and respectful
171717 they took me into their homes as one of their own and i always felt totally safe
171718 they are also incredibly generous they would rather their children had nothing to eat as long as you did
171719 when i heard things like that i would feel this weight on my shoulders and find myself asking why are we not doing anything about this
171720 every day i observed young israeli defence force women and men and their attitude to the palestinians was quite abusive it was almost as if they would go out of their way to humiliate people
171721 the occupation is very cruel and i lived it so i became very angry
171722 most of the people who came to the exhibition were palestinians so for them if was cathartic it was about them their history and it was very personal many were crying
171723 this doesnt have a message as such i think thats a terribly grandiose claim for any artwork
171724 instead it has an aim i want people to ask the questions that i asked and the most fundamental question is what happened to the palestinian people its not political its humanitarian im not a politician or an academic im not in a position to make grand sweeping statements i just want to pass on other peoples stories
171725 we have received continued significant local sponsor support from hawco volkswagen and gordon timber
171726 we decided to go ahead with what i am billing as a reflective programme over six days filled with the essential elements that have become synonymous with the festival and the style now known as ramage jazz
171727 ive been a few times to nairn going back to the mid 90s with jeff hamilton
171728 playing solo is definitely more exposed and i guess it has to be the ultimate challenge for a pianist
171729 there you really are responsible for literally everything you dont have bass and drums to lean on it gives you a lot of freedom but it is very challenging
171730 i would often play in a jazz club in ann arbor michigan and ernestine came through there in 1988 and used the local rhythm section which included me
171731 as a result she hired me to go on the road as her accompanist
171732 i relocated to seattle washington where she was based and i worked with her for about six years i was a musical director of sorts as well in that we would often pick up a bass player and drummer where we were playing on the road and i would rehearse them
171733 i played with ernestine at a club in santa monica in california and jeff was the drummer there in fact that club was partly owned by ray brown i had admired jeffs work with one of my favourite pianists monty alexander and when he decided to form his own trio in 1994 he asked me to join i think i recorded three cds with him and we travelled to europe quite a bit including playing in nairn
171734 i think i first had the chance to play with ray at the west coast jazz party
171735 what then happened was that he had a tour in europe with his trio coming up and his pianist at that point geoffrey keezer couldnt make the tour because his wife was having a baby just prior to that i had recorded my cd with ray and he asked me to substitute for geoffrey
171736 he is maybe the quintessential jazz bassist of all time and it was an honour to play with him
171737 he was such a masterful musician and it was a real blessing to have that opportunity i learned so much from being around him not just about music but how to lead a band and lots more
171738 i dont get as much chance to do my own trio as i would like
171739 john has a very full schedule but when i have time off i do try to do my own projects usually around the new york area where i live

171741 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
171742 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
171743 it has not progressed over the last couple of days but the window is open until the end of august and theres still plenty of time to run
171744 i think there is absolutely no question that any deal will be done with regard to didier drogba
171745 didier is in rehab and will continue to be a chelsea player
171746 i locked myself out of my apartment and its so late

171757 o que est faltando para o palmeiras fora de casa encaixar um bom jogo e vencer j conseguimos um bom resultado na casa do l der do campeonato um empate com o gr mio que foi bom pelas circunst ncias do jogo com aquela chuva agora s falta vencer

171764 farmers and ranchers like all consumers across america are feeling the tremendous financial impact of historically high energy costs
171765 in addition to gasoline costs diesel prices have risen drastically for agricultural producers while fertilizer costs which are closely tied to natural gas prices have doubled in the last two years now more than ever the agricultural sector is looking to congress for leadership to help alleviate these costs on consumers
171766 the development of energy resources anywhere in the united states
171767 clearly legitimate policy issues need to be addressed in crafting an energy plan that encompasses such an approach and it will need the cooperative constructive efforts of members from both political parties
171768 we urge the leadership of both parties in both houses of congress to put aside short term political considerations and work together to craft a long range bipartisan effective energy plan that will finally put our nation on a path toward affordable energy independence
171769 treatments must be made by certified treaters and there are a number of them in louisiana
171770 the reason dupont took that approach is to ensure the quality of the product that it went onto the seed at the proper rate
171771 its very important that estimate be on the mark because if you end up putting out less seed the product wont go out at the proper rate
171772 the prediction was for a 50 pound seeding rate the drill didnt work properly and the seeding rate was only 35 pounds it appears that might have affected the efficacy of the product
171773 we want to know how the product works on a commercial scale the reduction of larval populations on root masses was anywhere from no difference with the check to a 12 fold decrease in larval populations on average the reduction was about a six fold decrease i still have datasets coming in that im summarizing
171774 dermacor activity has looked better than the pyrethroids but the pyrethroids are still working well when used the right way
171775 keep in mind the pyrethroids are adulticides while dermacor is a larvicide dermacor is the only product currently on the market with larvicidal activity it works by being taken up into the plant material both above the soil line and into the roots it kills the larvae when they feed on the roots
171776 very good but in one case because of the weather the pyrethroid wasnt applied until 11 days after flood in that case you couldnt tell any treatment had been made this is a good illustration that if pyrethroids cant be applied at the right time it may not be worth putting the treatments out you cant miss the window to control the adults the pyrethroids form a film on the water surface
171777 there has been a myth floating around that trebon has the ability to control larvae on roots id like to drive home the message that as far as we know it doesnt have that ability
171778 the first is the south american rice miner which is a sporadic pest in the state its been here for several years now
171779 the pest hasnt been reported in louisiana yet thankfully but it is very close one county from the texas border i believe
171780 this is a new pest were watching for its a large aquatic snail that will feed on rice under the surface of the water
171781 when you see the size of the shell you think how could anyone miss that but since its underwater it can go unobserved
171782 please let us know so far its been found in a houma bayou area but it hasnt been found in rice yet
171783 i understand state and federal agencies will get together on some conference calls in the next couple of weeks to discuss changing the regulatory situation
171784 undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
171785 i must not only withdraw from public but from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena not give interviews and not even publish literary works in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
171786 it is clear that unable to fulfil the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karardzic
171787 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic just as long as i left
171788 i fulfilled my side of the agreement on the first day and stuck to it for a very long time
171789 our intelligence services noted many aggressive activities by international forces in places from which i had just departed
171790 these actions were clearly organised in order to liquidate someone not at all to arrest him
171791 mr holbrookes wish for my disappearance if possible before i unveiled this and other truths is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
171792 i have to sit in a place that is know to him and his friends and prepare my defence there can not be any regularity in this because i do not know how long the arm of mr holbrooke or mrs albright is or of anyone from that team or whether that arm can reach me here
171793 i believe there will be more after the lynch mob atmosphere in the media and the public to which former and perhaps future high ranking diplomats of great powers like the usa have contributed so much along with others from president clintons team who are in a hurry to see me dead
171794 i negotiated a very tough deal he had to step down immediately from both his posts as president of the serb part of bosnia and as head of his party and he did so
171795 it would only be interesting if google made an offer with six zeros because the dutch tax rate of 52 percent would leave too little on the table an offer in the million euro range would make things a lot more fun
171796 im a trials rider but ryan is the trials rider i think few people understand trials and the skills involved
171797 i just like watching him come up on he front of the bike to do a front wheel stand
171798 i liked the teeter totter and the balance that he has
171799 in the future everyone will have 15 minutes of fame

171832 it looks a bit odd to be shrinking on the one hand and calling for a third runway with the other if they end up making further cuts in subsequent seasons the effect will be to undermine bas case
171833 it does not undermine the case at all none of the cuts we are making are going to reduce the number of slots we have at heathrow it will not diminish the argument for a third runway in the slightest

171854 this is the meat of our legislative responsibility here in congress

171859 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
171860 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years

171942 with the recent selling pressure on our shares we focused our efforts on trying to arrange a large debt facility as a means of minimizing longer term equity dilution it became clear from the feedback we received from our shareholders that they were concerned about the overhang this debt would have on our ability to continue to grow the company this current bridge facility will offer the company time with which to pursue numerous other alternatives we are continuing to process bulk samples through our 1 200 ton per day gravity recovery plant at golden summit and we expect to see positive cash flow from this operation over the coming months which will also be used to fund our ongoing programs and administration of the company during these difficult markets for the junior mining equities freegold will seek to leverage its operating expertise and its processing plant into alternative sources of cash flow generation our modular and portable processing plant which is only permitted to operate for a short summer period at golden summit is completely self contained including 1 2 mw of portable power generation dual crushing circuits ball mill grinding circuits and multiple stage gravity concentration and can be transported to other projects as a result we are currently investigating a number of high grade stock piles in the southern us that could be amenable to processing using our plant as a source of additional cash flow for the company

171965 judging by the burns we have seen on the injured we think that the building collapsed because a gas container exploded

171967 as a cabinet we are not working just for the sake of approval ratings

171970 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
171971 to tide over what appears to be the biggest crisis since the partys foundation
171972 the markets attention will turn today friday to the release of the us employment report for july
171973 we believe that the report is likely to reinforce the deteriorating labour market trend
171974 we believe that a weaker than expected nfp non farm payrolls report may elicit a similar response to the weaker gdp data suggesting greater downside risks to euro dollar
171975 it is an umbrella agreement which provides for any facility notified by india to the agency in the future to become subject to safeguards
171976 which have invariably been adopted by this body swiftly and by consensus
171977 precisely because it is an umbrella agreement that does not identify specific facility under supervision india will also be able in the future to add other facilities engaged in peaceful nuclear activities to that list and place them under safeguards
171978 the deal will allow new facilities to be placed under supervision the agency will thus be able to give assurances about the peaceful use of a greater number of facilities
171979 they had a full camp set up with a sleeping area a kitchen even an area set up as a bathroom
171980 they used branches to make themselves shelves and had propane tanks for cooking
171981 we took about 2 000 pounds of marijuana off the street
171982 lets not mess about our people are abandoning us were sinking fast and no amount of hand wringing and promises of listening and learning from election night will change that the new labour attitude that you can kick the workers from pillar to post because theyve got nowhere else to go has reached its ludicrous conclusion with the election with working class votes of the snp in scotland independent radicals in wales and the bnp in industrial english towns like stoke on trent we dont need to play one half of britain off against another its not too late to change but choose change we must
171983 the situation in sudan now is so pregnant with trouble
171984 it just showed how the army is stretched to the limits
171985 a lot of the political entities looked into the abyss and were scared
171986 the country was preparing itself for a new phase of government
171987 the government is brutal untrustworthy and bloodthirsty but the reality is that most of the violence in darfur today is not caused by them
171988 is there a genocide in darfur right at this moment no there isnt
171989 our story is not forgotten you are putting criminals on the record if not today tomorrow we will have justice and now it has happened
171990 he could end up very weak to challenges from inside and outside the ruling party
171991 now we are seriously talking about the resolution of the problem of darfur
171992 if we take the i c c from that angle it can be a blessing for the whole country
171993 the next total solar eclipse will not be visible from ireland until 2090 the last was in 1724
171994 would constitute an overly dominant and oppressive appearance on the streetscape

172001 weve found a framing concept for an important class of materials which allows us to begin to understand how they relate to each other and perhaps to find new members of the group
172002 its the first study ive done in this field and the results are astounding they indicate a very strong correlation between this type of social factor and the risk of developing dementia
172003 this suggests two influencing factors social and intellectual stimulation and trauma
172004 in practice it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis if our interpretation will hold such an intervention strategy could also be profitable for society considering the costs for dementia care
172005 does it matter for instance if the relationship is a happy one or not and does it matter if someone has always intended to live a single life or not
172006 the results of the present study show a marked increase in antiviral effect in patients when ribavirin is added to the combination of r1626 and peginterferon alfa 2a
172007 this phase 2a study has demonstrated a potent reduction in hcv rna by r1626 and high viral responses with up to 74 percent rapid viral response after 4 weeks of treatment the strong antiviral effect between r1626 peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin suggests that the dose of one or both of these agents could be lowered to improve tolerability without significantly compromising efficacy
172008 the decreases in hcv rna from baseline observed with r1626 indicates potent antiviral activity and lack of viral load rebound in the significant majority of patients following 14 days of monotherapy

172012 this is the first glimpse into the chemical code that nematodes are using to communicate
172013 it is the first time that two distinct and different life history traits reproduction and developmental arrest have been found to be regulated by the same family of molecules suggesting a link which we had not suspected between the corresponding pathways
172014 that interfere with the chemical signaling involved in the reproductive process

172016 knee pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints that bring people to their doctor
172017 human cartilage injuries heal poorly and can lead to cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis this is an enormous clinical problem it is estimated that one quarter of the adult population will have some kind of arthritis by 2020
172018 the research we have published is an early but important step in unraveling the important pathways that will facilitate development of new treatments
172019 if we can identify what genes or proteins are necessary for cartilage to heal we can work toward finding similar genes and proteins in humans
172020 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
172021 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
172022 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
172023 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
172024 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
172025 the scientific community is really going to run with this
172026 revolutionary progress in bringing solar energy to its full potential in the energy marketplace
172027 theres little doubt that if we burn all of the coal that sits below the earths surface we can return the planet to the condition it was in 50 million years ago when the antarctic was a tropical forest and much of the rest of the planet would be pretty difficult for human beings to live on
172028 weve got to see that coal is not a useful resource to burn unless we can recapture the carbon that is produced by burning it
172029 we therefore need to work positively towards carbon capture and storage if we can manage that then of course we can continue to use coal to drive our economies but frankly i havent seen the proof that that can be done
172030 this is still unproven technology and i think until its proven its dangerous to assume that we can continue to use coal
172031 i think those power stations are going to be priced out of the market as carbon dioxide pricing goes up so i quite simply dont think its a good private sector decision to invest in coal fired power stations
172032 it seems to me that carbon capture upon which the whole thing predicates you cant use coal unless you can capture the carbon is such an unproven science and its such a long time in the future that it would be dangerous in the extreme climatically for the government or e on to go ahead
172033 the rather boring fact is that the world is going to be burning lots of coal
172034 whatever people might wish whatever people singing in the sunshine at summer camps might idealise the world is going to be using lots of coals in future
172035 another coal power station at kingsnorth would be disastrous for the climate
172036 sir david king has joined the many others including both opposition parties who are speaking out against unabated coal power stations
172037 its now high time for the prime minister to step in show he has some courage and ditch the plans for kingsnorth

172065 critics of the self regulatory approach said they were troubled by the lack of industrywide definitions on what advertising to children entailed and on what better food meant
172066 in the better business bureau program the companies themselves determine what is better food the companies themselves determine what is childrens advertising the companies determine all these things theres not even a real uniformity in what these decisions are
172067 one place to start would be a ban on tv advertising to children under 12 another would be stop marketing to kids in school including through vehicles such as channel one

172075 as youll have gathered from our many and varied blogs broadcasts and photos weve been lost in a world of new music over the last few months writing songs pushing our limits making fools of ourselves and generally having a wicked time
172076 we started out in paris where jon brion inspired us to create first and think later
172077 we took the night train to berlin where everything came together in an avalanche of experimentation that took us all by surprise where we made a pact with stuart price to ignore the rules of good taste where we were hypnotised by marlene dietrich and spent many a long night throwing ideas around in the crumbling cabaret esque glamour of our favourite bar

172085 the sew eurodrive victoria cup is one of the most sought after races on the australasian harness racing calendar and thus we have made a commitment to continue to foster its growth through stake increases such as this
172086 it is particularly pleasing to be able to continue the upward trend in prizemoney for our premier mobile start race despite the challenging financial climate that we find ourselves in as a result of last years e i outbreak

172088 sew eurodrive is delighted to hear of the stakes increase for the 2008 sew eurodrive victoria cup a race which is held in the highest esteem by the australasian harness racing industry
172089 it is particularly heartening that hrv has seen fit to increase the stakes for this years cup once again despite the financial impacts of last years e i outbreak and we look forward to showcasing another outstanding event in december

172108 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
172109 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
172110 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who who could have been a good australian citizen
172111 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we would have been a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
172112 we married before a marriage registrar but did not tell my father that my husband was from a different community in december 2006 i came to my village along with my husband who assumed a different name of my community as our village is very orthodox during our stay of 12 days nobody suspected my husband
172113 a shalishi meeting was held the same evening in the local primary school where my father took my husband from that night on my husband went missing

172119 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
172120 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
172121 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
172122 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
172123 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
172124 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
172125 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
172126 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
172127 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
172128 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one

172136 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
172137 you have value on the ground more than you spent
172138 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
172139 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
172140 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
172141 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
172142 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
172143 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
172144 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
172145 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
172146 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
172147 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
172148 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
172149 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
172150 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
172151 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
172152 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
172153 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
172154 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

172185 we cannot say ahead of time what novel functionalities will arise in the biosphere thus we do not know what variables lungs wings etc to put into our equations the newtonian scientific framework where we can prestate the variables the laws among the variables and the initial and boundary conditions and then compute the forward behavior of the system cannot help us predict future states of the biosphere

172207 das rekordergebnis f r das erste halbjahr best tigt unsere erwartung f r ergebniswachstum in 2008 im vergleich zum vorjahr
172208 allerdings steigen die kosten normalerweise wegen projektabschl ssen vor allem im vierten quartal nochmals
172209 gr nde f r den kostenr ckgang gegen ber dem vorjahresquartal sind niedrigere aufwendungen f r die aktienbasierte verg tung niedrigere abschreibungen sowie das im letzten jahr bekannt gegebene restrukturierungsprogramm

172217 i was singing 9 to 5 and i choked and forgot the words in front of the president and in front of dolly parton whos like the president to me
172218 so many people want to bring me down and i cant wait to prove them wrong if they believe what they read about me they automatically persecute and torment me
172219 thats ludicrous he just wants me to be happy our whole family gets beaten but that just brings us closer so people are really doing themselves a disservice
172220 i was going through a lot of pain i didnt try anything to change my life other than dating different types of guys and conforming to their worlds i thought i had to be artsier more intellectual
172221 john believed in the jessica simpson thats within he cherished our love he helped make me the woman i am today john is going to be an amazing man for someone but i know that i was supposed to be with someone else
172222 i had to record that theres nothing on my album that youre gonna hear that i dont relate to or that i havent experienced because the only way i know how to sing is from life experience i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in away that i would tell people to take their heart and run
172223 everyone knew it was coming the faa planned for it
172224 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
172225 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
172226 no one is closer to mccain than salter who has been with him since 1989

172231 enter public life determined to tell the truth to put problem solving ahead of partisanship to defend the public interest against the special interests to risk your personal ambitions for the sake of the country and the ideals that make her great keep your promise to america and you will keep your honor you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure
172232 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
172233 some view the flag as a symbol of slavery others view it as a symbol of heritage personally i see the battle flag as a symbol of heritage
172234 should be lowered forever from the staff atop south carolinas capitol
172235 i had promised to tell the truth no matter what
172236 when i broke it i had not just been dishonest i had been a coward and i had severed my own interests from my countrys that was what made the lie unforgivable

172238 in the many many years that ive been in washington
172239 john mccain is far and away the most emotional politician i have ever met
172240 people dont understand that so they keep talking about his temperament his temper he reacts emotionally therefore unpredictably
172241 there is no such thing as compromise you either win or you lose
172242 we lost in vietnam because we lost the will to fight because we did not understand the nature of the war we were fighting and because we limited the tools at our disposal
172243 all i can say is they the iraqis are establishing the rule of law theyre going to be having elections and i think theyre becoming an effective government which is what our strategy was thanks to the genius of a guy named david petraeus
172244 occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
172245 but the fact is we did win easily it was terribly mismanaged
172246 what he really enjoys although the witnesses seldom do is to put opposing witnesses on the same panel and sit back and watch them fight and see who has the best argument
172247 im happy with the way our campaign is run it should be chaotic i should have mark salter and steve and rick and charlie and these guys on the line arguing with each other and saying baloney
172248 mccain is quite lively and dexterous intellectually he seems willing to listen to criticism and reevaluate positions and he doesnt mind being challenged
172249 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
172250 we can all stand a little self improvement from time to time but its hard to accomplish when you have reached my age
172251 can work in partnership with russia to strengthen protections against weapons of mass destruction
172252 would that happen before or after we kick them out of the g 8
172253 id like to send them a hard signal but you need to work with them in areas of common interest
172254 i dont know if it will or not but i think youve got to have people who you think would interpret the constitution of the united states most accurately
172255 whether that means that certain decisions go for or against you then i think we just have to obviously you cant have litmus tests
172256 many contemporary conservatives have let their healthy skepticism about government sink into something unhealthy an embittered loathing of the federal government
172257 must not shrink from its duty to be the highest expression of the national will and the last bulwark against all assaults on our founding ideals
172258 unfettered capitalism leads to corruption we are seeing that with the subprime lending crisis
172259 may not be decisive for the average voter right now given our economic troubles but its knowledge they can store in the back of their minds for when they go into the polling place later
172260 im surprised that i am as close in the polls as i am right now when you look at the fantastic campaign that senator obama has waged it really is quite remarkable
172261 people who vote against this today are voting against me and i will not forget it
172262 so now you know its not really abut president bush its not about oil or gas its not about the environment its about ted stevens
172263 what i dont want to do is say something because it sounds good politically
172264 instead of offering any real plan to lower gas prices sen mccain touts his support for george bushs plan for offshore oil drilling
172265 but even the bush administration acknowledges that offshore oil drilling will have little impact on prices it wont lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration in fact we wont see a drop of oil from this drilling for almost 10 years
172266 the issues that people care about have changed dramatically since 2006 here and not incidentally in a way that is beneficial to republican candidates

172280 das erfolgsmodell der eu ausgleich und harmonisierung von interessen wohlstand und soziale gerechtigkeit hat ausstrahlungswirkung weit ber die eu hinaus ein herzeigbares und beachtliches beispiel daf r ist die entwicklung unserer s dosteurop ischen nachbarn sterreich setzte sich im europ ischen rahmen immer schon sehr stark f r die ausweitung der stabilit tszone durch die weitere heranf hrung der l nder des westbalkans ein sie erh ht unsere sicherheit und st rkt gleichzeitig die sicherheit unserer partner
172281 dabei wurde klar dass die grunds tzlich positive entwicklung in der region nicht von selbst eintritt sondern harte arbeit ist die europ ischen union und insbesondere wir sterreicher haben dabei eine wichtige rolle in der fortf hrung der stabilisierung entwicklung und reformarbeit in der region
172282 der reformwille muss von innen kommen und nicht weil es die europ ischen partner f r sinnvoll und wichtig erachten es liegt in der verantwortung jedes landes zukunftsperspektiven f r ihre b rger zu schaffen
172283 regionale zusammenarbeit gute nachbarschaftliche beziehungen sowie eine engere wirtschaftliche und politische vernetzung mit unseren nachbarn haben erheblich zu unserem wohlstand in sterreich beigetragen auch f r die l nder s dosteuropas bedeutet regionale zusammenarbeit keinen ersatz sondern eine wichtige voraussetzung f r eine erfolgreiche integration in die europ ischen strukturen die zukunft der staaten des westbalkans liegt nach eigenem ermessen und nach weiteren dauerhaften und nachhaltigen reformen in der eu zu diesem ziel haben wir uns bereits mehrfach bekannt
172284 den wiener weg der arbeitsmarktpolitik auf ganz sterreich auszuweiten das kann angesichts der zahlen und fakten nur als gef hrliche drohung aufgefasst werden
172285 nat rlich ist der r ckgang der arbeitslosigkeit in wien erfreulich leider bersieht der arbeitsmarktexperte professor harald kopietz aber in seiner analyse dass wien nach wie vor die rote laterne tr gt und die h chste arbeitslosenquote aller bundesl nder aufweist w hrend die vp regierten bundesl nder im bundesschnitt oder deutlich darunter liegen hinkt das rote wien nach wie vor hinterher und vom letzten platz aus langsam aufzuholen ist wahrlich kein grund sich auf die schultern zu klopfen
172286 bevor die sp in wien vor freude kollabiert sollten sie die wachstumszahlen des wifo studieren wien erreichte im vergangenen jahr auch hier nur den letzten platz ober sterreich w chst doppelt so schnell wie die bundeshauptstadt und ohne wachstumsimpulse bleiben die verbesserten arbeitsmarktzahlen nur eintagsfliegen
172287 das regnerische wetter machte heuer im bundesgebiet und insbesondere auch in nieder sterreich den positiven prognosen f r die getreideernte einen strich durch die rechnung gut entwickelte best nde und die aussicht auf aufnahmef hige m rkte und hohe nachfrage infolge leerer lager erlaubten im vorfeld eine optimistische grundstimmung zus tzliche ertr ge waren durch den entfall der stilllegungsverpflichtung zu erwarten weil mehr getreideanbaufl che zur verf gung stand ertragsm ig bestehen heuer gro e regionale unterschiede
172288 die regnerische witterung im juli konnte in nieder sterreich die menge zwar nicht mehr wesentlich schm lern die qualit t und damit den erzielbaren preis allerdings sehr wohl der regen kam zu der zeit wo das getreide reif war und verhinderte ein rasches ernten die reduzierte qualit t des mehlk rpers im korn und die abstufung der verwendbarkeit f r geringerwertige zwecke wird zu preisabschl gen f hren
172289 in den fr hdruschgebieten konnten zumindest teile der ernte bereits vor der schlechtwetterperiode und mit guten ertr gen und qualit ten eingebracht werden im bereich der westbahn in teilen des tullnerfeldes im waldviertel und im voralpengebiet gibt es zum teil schon optisch deutlich sichtbaren auswuchs und deutlich verringerte backqualit t im klassischen trockengebiet ist zwar oft noch kein auswuchs sichtbar die fallzahl als ma zahl f r die backqualit t aber trotzdem schon reduziert worden nach wie vor gibt es aber auch durchwegs partien mit ansprechenden qualit ten
172290 es ist zu hoffen dass alle veredelungsbetriebe ihr futtergetreide ohne zu gro e handelsspannen erwerben k nnen damit wenigstens in diesem sektor die wirtschaftlichkeit der produktion gegeben ist zus tzlich ist die verf gbarkeit von mehr als ausreichend getreide f r die energieproduktion gegeben unsere vorgabe zuerst teller dann futtertrog und dann tank beweist heuer seine richtigkeit zu hoffen ist jetzt noch dass auch die sp tdruschgebiete die ernte rasch und unfallfrei einbringen k nnen
172291 wien werde als letzter waggon von der lokomotive bund mitgezogen
172292 mittlerweile gibt sich die wiener sp schon mit den kleinsten regionalen fortschritten zufrieden in sterreich steht wien mit 61 227 arbeitslosen immer noch als schlusslicht da statt betriebe abzusiedeln sollte wien daran arbeiten in dieser hinsicht wieder die spitze zu erklimmen
172293 die wirtschaft ist nach wie vor nicht bereit ltere arbeitnehmer einzustellen
172294 nat rlich muss es vorrangiges ziel sein die arbeitslosigkeit so niedrig wie m glich zu halten allerdings bei entsprechendem einkommen
172295 kaum ist die regierung geplatzt werden daten anders interpretiert als noch vor zwei monaten es ist bedauerlich dass ein ernstes thema wie arbeitslosigkeit nur als argumentationsspielball dient
172296 w re bartenstein wirklich in sorge um die arbeitslosen menschen in unserem land dann h tte er jetzt jahrelang zeit gehabt um massiv in den bereich der qualifizierung und wiedereingliederungsunterst tzung von arbeitssuchenden zu investieren statt dessen hat er mit einem knebel arbeitslosenversicherungsgesetz jeden arbeitssuchenden in den n chsten x beliebigen job gezwungen das ist kein nachhaltiges konzept sondern nur kosmetik zu statistikbeh bschung
172297 die arbeitszeitflexibilisierungen der vergangenheit gehen fast ausschlie lich auf kosten der arbeitnehmerinnen wir br uchten aber insgesamt eine innovative neuverteilung von bezahlter arbeit steigende berstunden mehr teilzeitbesch ftigungen und arbeitslose da erkennt doch jeder dass es hier einen neuen ausgleich braucht

172321 das rekordergebnis f r das erste halbjahr best tigt unsere erwartung f r ergebniswachstum in 2008 im vergleich zum vorjahr
172322 allerdings steigen die kosten normalerweise wegen projektabschl ssen vor allem im vierten quartal nochmals
172323 gr nde f r den kostenr ckgang gegen ber dem vorjahresquartal sind niedrigere aufwendungen f r die aktienbasierte verg tung niedrigere abschreibungen sowie das im letzten jahr bekannt gegebene restrukturierungsprogramm
172324 we hope voters in the area would not be influenced by pkr de facto leader datuk seri anwar ibrahim who may use the campaign to garner sympathy over the sodomy allegation

172439 it shows theres a shortage of liquidity in the system
172440 what that tells you is that theres an increasing number of banks that the fed is classifying as unsound or inadequately capitalized
172441 i am sure there are troubled banks trying to tap the window
172442 more and more banks are trying to take advantage of the pure economic advantage of borrowing at a cheap rate and you are seeing a gradual fading away of the stigma of using the discount window
172443 despite the likelihood that the rumors contributed to the fall in the share price the f s a has not uncovered evidence that they were spread as part of a concerted attempt by individuals to profit by manipulating the share price
172444 there is no doubt that false and damaging rumors were circulating about hbos on 19 march 2008 and these would have had some impact on hbos share price
172445 it is difficult however to say how much impact as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day
172446 i want to hold this board and management team accountable for the last year
172447 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo

172454 huey felt their relationship was one sided dewey and louie thought he was acting a bit unhinged
172455 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
172456 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
172457 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
172458 the mccain campaign was compelled to respond to this outrageous attack because we will not allow john mccain to be smeared by senator obama as a racist for offering legitimate criticism
172459 we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it incur with president clinton
172460 we are committed to continuing cooperation in the military technical sphere among others especially since the libyan leadership has confirmed its interest in buying quality products from the russian defense industry
172461 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
172462 essentially it will be the latest in a series of industry renationalisations and a reversal of what till now has been one of russias privatization success stories
172463 its the last chance to see heath and hes brilliant filming stopped for a bit until the three heroes as theyre now known jude law johnny depp and colin farrell came to the rescue and finished off heaths part so you ended up with four actors playing one character

172467 we have no doubt that we will continue with the case
172468 we just need to have the legal procedure in place our lawyer michael havemann has begun by making an application for the case to be heard by the supreme court
172469 i hope the young friends of china and the united states will strengthen exchanges learn from each other increase friendship and make greater contribution to promoting the friendly relations between china and the united states and to creating an even better tomorrow for the world
172470 it is inevitable that people hold divergent views on issues but politicizing the olympics will not address those issues
172471 instead those issues can be resolved on the basis of mutual respect by narrowing the differences and expanding common ground
172472 of course when foreign reporters cover stories i hope they adhere to chinese laws and rules and maintain objectivity
172473 one model honors its contracts and takes very seriously the contracts it enters into with its employees
172474 i was raised by a single mom and am surrounded by strong women so seeing females treated as nothing more than ornaments or toys doesnt sit well with me
172475 i put on the suit slick back my hair and suddenly im a megalomaniacal bastard
172476 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the united states did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
172477 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
172478 it is not the defense that has requested this closed session
172479 but it is necessary according to the government to protect the information

172481 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
172482 this is an action with the federal government which is sad
172483 because these laws need to be revisited in washington especially the medical marijuana law were incarcerating people by the tens of thousands were destroying peoples lives and people who have a medical marijuana legitimacy are caught in the middle
172484 i told the wto director general that india is ready to be on the table without compromising on issues which concern poor farmers of not only india but 100 other developing countries

172496 essentially what childs did was build a car give the city the keys to start the engine and drive the car normally but he locked the hood so nobody else could work on the car
172497 ill use this in a meal maybe some vegetable soup or sprinkled over a casserole or even just for snacking
172498 the world is messy and its only going to get messier as the web destroys rules and rule makers you can either complain about the chaos and wish for the good old days of order or you can start to understand why delirious disorder will make us all smarter
172499 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
172500 oh i saw on your profile that you like the same music i do
172501 i feel a lot of psychological pressure so many people died including my friend im at a loss what to do but i just tell myself i need to stand up by myself
172502 they were destroyed in the quake and i donated any goods i could salvage to earthquake relief
172503 savings have gone up by 1 5 million dollars since the quake
172504 its because people no longer have no houses to hide their money in
172505 people here are saying if you have money you may as well eat it now
172506 they say there could be another earthquake tomorrow so you may as well spend all your money on food

172508 im still going to decide at the end of the season whether im going to stay
172509 all ive been thinking about was npc and now ive been called into the all blacks my main focus has been the test against australia tomorrow
172510 he knew what he had to do he didnt need to be rung up and told why he wasnt selected because he knew what he had to do and took it upon himself to make the changes
172511 he was very positive and showed us a bit of hunger
172512 it feels good to be back in the squad and trying to get back in the team after last years exit
172513 im definitely feeling hungry to get back in the squad and to get my opportunity if it does come on saturday ill take the opportunity to prove my point and hopefully do well
172514 i am pretty hungry and i have been pretty positive
172515 theres always room to work on your fitness and im still doing that but i feel im capable of doing my job around the field im feeling quite fit
172516 the field crew did a great job trying to get as much water off the field as possible the rain kept on coming everyone was trying their hardest to get the game in im glad this game is behind us
172517 i thought we were going to be really good on set pieces and as the game wore on tonight i thought we looked better and better on set pieces
172518 and it didnt help them that calero had a little bit of a leg problem and on the first goal he wasnt his usual aggressive self sometimes the ball just bounces your way de ro puts it up craig heads it over and he just finds boswell on that goal it was good and we were excited but there was still a little bit of worry because they are a good team over there
172519 it is very tough to play against teams like that because they are very confident
172520 having said that i thought we were solid defensively with the exception of those few minutes in the second half but when we needed him pat was there to make the big saves offensively i thought we created a lot of chances tonight and you really cant ask for more against these guys
172521 colorado threw everything that they could at us soccers a funny game it makes up for playing at home against new england and dominating the game and losing 1 0 on a late penalty we dominated san jose and we lost 2 0 in the game today we got dominated and we came out with a win thats just the way it goes
172522 we switched formations tonight and we are still learning the 3 5 2 so they were able to come at us a little bit
172523 i think that we were late in the midfield and in the challenge but for the most part they were not that dangerous
172524 when the balls on the other side of the field its almost like im playing left back it was a little more defense than im used to playing but ill do whatever i can to help the team maybe it wasnt the nicest soccer the prettiest game to look at but for this team to play hard and get those three points is huge for us
172525 at halftime we switched to a 4 4 1 because of the red card
172526 we left guillermo up on the top alone and told him to work for 15 20 minutes and then we brought jason garey on and let him work we told our guys to stay in make sure that they step to the ball and restrict colorado to crosses and shots outside of the 18 yard box as much as possible
172527 we talked a lot about defense this week to be a championship team we need to learn to defend better then to come up here tonight and a get clean sheet tonight with all the pressure we did receive will hesmer was phenomenal tonight and came up with some big saves
172528 this team is fine going on the road and playing
172529 we dont really look at it too much differently than playing at home we just keep going out and playing the same style of soccer thats what we did sunday although we had to play a little more defense than we have in past games on the road
172530 i dont feel him in a way that i feel i have to call ghostbusters but ive been haunted by elvis in the sense that when i knew him he was very sweet but also seriously into drugs
172531 ive been haunted by wishing he could have lived longer because im from memphis and ive had the fame thing too
172532 everybody is dating everyone and sleeping with everyone and theres lots of scandalous stuff happening in the upper east side
172533 even i am shocked im expecting my sister that i dont have to be my father
172534 they try to sell it racier and sexier than it actually is
172535 if critics watched the show they would see it is not as racy as it actually seems but because we dont have numbers it is about buzz the marketers try to put us in the tabloids all the time and make up crazy stories about us
172536 its like gossip magazine on tv people love to gossip and watch people living glamorous lives
172537 i dont think were trying to preach to anyone how to live their life
172538 its like sex and the city with more drama and for younger kids
172539 its kind of like what you want life to be all the girls come off really pretty and dress really well and are so confident
172540 high school girls as little more than gossipy sex objects is simply a tired cliche that does all females a disservice
172541 it glamorizes and normalizes the kinds of behavior that may seem charmingly risque and sophisticated when little girls see them on tv but which if emulated in real life can result in emotional and psychological distress for them
172542 its another very important test obviously when you lose a couple its puts an extra emphasis on this particular test and i think thats pretty obvious
172543 that puts a bit of an extra edge on it a bit of extra stress id imagine
172544 so its very important test theres always a lot of tension in every test you are involved in particularly the big ones australia south africa and a number of others so theres always a lot of tension around a test match and thats the way it should be
172545 oh for sure its a big game for the bledisloe cup and the tri nations dead right
172546 we have put our bets foot forward this week the guys have trained well and they are very focused they have been very focused right through the six test matches we have played this year i couldnt ask any more of them
172547 as a group they are really trying to do the business whether we are good enough we cant do any more than we are doing
172548 we are building as a team hopefully we have built enough to have a very good performance at the weekend
172549 under those circumstances the warrant for his arrest will be activated and mr siemer will be committed to prison for six months

172555 for men its less of a shortfall when they are older because thats when they tend to be married and when women have already experienced things like divorce and widowhood
172556 for women often children are very important and more fulfilling than for men so that can be something that sustains their satisfaction with family life
172557 usually people who are married have a better financial situation since often they have double incomes
172558 they also are more likely to fulfill their financial aspirations
172559 its generally assumed including by public policy makers whether youre healthy and you own a lot of stuff are the two most important things in whether you are satisfied in life
172560 and research consistently does not find this including this study

172562 in economic theory one of the assumptions is that preferences are stable so you basically dont change your wants but we see the wants do change that people really adapt to achievement
172563 so when they attain goods then they want more goods
172564 i am sure that yahoo management will take a verbal beating
172565 i just dont think that the annual meeting is where the debate over yahoo strategy is going to take place
172566 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
172567 it is not going to be a retirees board the benefit of having icahn on the board is the status quo is broken it is going to be under an awful lot pressure to act
172568 some of the bigger shareholders want to push for a new ceo
172569 there is a small possibility that shareholder disappointment results in jerry yang being moved aside in a sort of bloodless coup
172570 some significant gaps that cannot be filled in except by speculation
172571 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
172572 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
172573 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
172574 the court has ascertained that nevzlin organised a whole host of extremely serious crimes
172575 the decision of the court was written in advance by the kremlin and there is no surprise in this decision
172576 this is a show trial managed under the supervision of the kremlin and controlled by russian prime minister vladimir putin and his gang
172577 this process will involve more party members than ever before and we have ensured that we have maximum debate within the party
172578 as a result of expected revenue and cost synergies we are confident that this acquisition will improve future earnings growth potential

172585 this looks like peppered porridge a sea of ice floes speckled with seals
172586 most of the bergs ice is underwater and they sometimes capsize or calve so you have to be careful
172587 this is just like the fjords we saw in norway
172588 id like a few moments with the unknown soldier please

172590 never was so much owed by so many to so few
172591 its dead in the water because the concert was a success there was hope of a tour but that was a lot of speculation
172592 it would be great if they would but as far as we know that is dead in the water
172593 it looks a bit odd to be shrinking on the one hand and calling for a third runway with the other if they end up making further cuts in subsequent seasons the effect will be to undermine bas case
172594 it does not undermine the case at all none of the cuts we are making are going to reduce the number of slots we have at heathrow it will not diminish the argument for a third runway in the slightest

172612 rcus are critical to the common transponder program for u s navy and u s army requirements and we are confident that once the requested out of scope design enhancements are finalized our company will deliver all of the rcu units that have previously been completed and ramp up production for the expedited delivery of all remaining units
172613 it is unfortunate that several unforeseen enhanced modification requests that were totally beyond our control have had a significant impact on the delivery of completed units that were available for shipment during the second quarter however the rcu modifications we are working on should ultimately provide our soldiers and sailors with enhanced capabilities that are critical in battlefield conditions
172614 since our company has extensive design expertise and has delivered in excess of 4 000 rcu units that are fully operational in support of critical combat missions in iraq and afghanistan the u s army and our customer continue to endorse and rely on our engineering resources for these new modifications we believe that there continues to be great demand for these units and the rcus will be an integral part of our business for the foreseeable future

172619 i was talking to one of his ex girlfriends not too long ago and she was texting him the whole way back from edmonton until 10 minutes before this accident happens
172620 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
172621 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed
172622 we heard this blood curdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
172623 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
172624 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
172625 all very calmly he was wearing sunglasses it was no big deal to him
172626 the guy came to the front of the door with buddys head in his hands decapitated he dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
172627 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
172628 my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up
172629 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy
172630 hes always been a quiet guy just kind of socialized with his buddies and that was it
172631 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
172632 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
172633 we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process
172634 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare certainly the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
172635 due to the rural nature of our network airport type security is not practical its a very different type of system
172636 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
172637 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
172638 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this blood curdling scream
172639 i dont know much about them but i will try to get over there before the first leg to see them
172640 the standard of football over there is quite high but we were never going to get an easy draw its not often you get the chance to play in europe so we are going to make the most of it and enjoy it the younger boys at the club can only benefit its a different type of football and so it will be a great experience and i am going to enjoy it as i enjoyed the scottish cup final last season
172641 its been reported to us and we are in the middle of an investigation and what i can say is that the c amp ags office is co operating with us on it but we dont really comment on investigations when they are ongoing
172642 over the next few years saudi officials say this stretch of desert will be transformed into a buzzing hub of scientific research and development with cutting edge universities hospitals and housing for more than 130 000 people attracted by the idea of living in the city where islams prophet muhammad is buried the project called knowledge economic city represents a first serious step by saudi arabia toward building a post petroleum economy it is one of six major industrial centers planned to rise over the next 15 years at a cost of more than 100 billion the sites are expected to provide housing and jobs for the countrys fast growing population half of which is younger than 21 these cities from scratch are the most ambitious projects to date launched by a kingdom enriched almost entirely by oil since its disparate regions were unified into a state more than seven decades ago in beginning to construct an economy to survive the end of its natural resources the saudi government is drawing on lessons learned during a previous oil boom when profits were squandered in part by spendthrift princes and short term planning that emphasized infrastructure over education
172643 with oil prices peaking above 145 a barrel in recent weeks the kingdom is reaping an unprecedented windfall from its vast reservoirs of oil which represent a quarter of the worlds proven reserves saudi arabia reported oil income of 200 billion last year and projects 700 billion in revenue over the next two years the kingdom earned an average of 43 billion annually throughout the 1990s
172644 saudi officials have long feared that too high oil prices would push the world toward alternative fuels a concern captured by one former oil ministers tart reminder that the stone age did not end for lack of stone to meet rising demand as well as to slow the worlds rush to develop alternative energy sources saudi officials have raised oil production by 500 000 barrels a day since may though increased production means the saudi reserves will be depleted faster the government is using a burst of additional capital to develop an economy it hopes will eventually be untethered from the price of oil
172645 the new cities are part of a broader effort to diversify the economy away from oil and away from its reliance on the public sector the cities are intended to develop more of a non oil economy well before the oil runs out said jane kinninmont an analyst at the economist intelligence unit a research and advisory company that provides industry and management analysis of countries around the world based on economic zones around the world the cities aim to trade saudi assets plentiful and cheap oil and vast open spaces for foreign expertise and training but the cities also have social aims analysts said including creating jobs to stave off political unrest when there was money it was easy to absorb young saudis into public jobs but the population kept growing and the local education system did not produce enough candidates for the local job market that caused resentment and allowed militant groups to launch against the local dynasty said younsi referring to a spate of al qaeda related attacks in 2003
172646 saudi arabias ambitious economic program calls for the kingdom to be among the worlds top 10 economies in terms of ease of doing business by 2010 up from its current rank of 23rd getting there will probably force social change in several ways saudi officials said they are working on easing the lifestyle and visa restrictions that have kept foreigners from investing and living in the kingdom one side effect of that will probably be an easing of rules that ban men and women from mingling in public unless they are close relatives were not anymore an isolated island we realize the challenge today in order for us to be more competitive means more transparency and more gender equality said abdullah hameedadin head of the economic cities agency at the saudi arabian general investment authority the government body overseeing the projects hameedadin said that 30 percent of his staff is female and that he expects women to be allowed to drive in the new cities which is currently banned in the kingdom officials also said they were seeking to attract both male and female investors to the cities
172647 partly to bypass the bureaucracy and inefficiency of government ministries and partly to buffer itself against the volatility of oil prices the government will oversee the projects but leave the financing and management to the private sector a mix of saudi companies and investors from the gulf region japan malaysia and china among others king abdullah who ascended the throne three years ago has pushed hard to reform the countrys economy speeding the kingdoms entry into the world trade organization months after he became king one of the cities planned to rise along the red sea with canals running between high rise apartment buildings is named for him
172648 despite the decades of oil wealth the saudi education system is ranked as one of the worst worldwide tens of thousands of university graduates are unemployed and the country manufactures and produces very little
172649 when the six cities are complete about 2020 they will house nearly 5 million people and provide more than 1 million jobs planners say
172650 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants

172652 the price of e on shares has for some time been well over 100 euros and thus seems to be relatively high compared with other dax stock dividing the price by three is intended to make the share more attractive to private investors in particular for whom the high price might be an obstacle to buy our shares

172666 introducing a resolution recognizing a strategic success that a surge has achieved in a central front a central front of a war on terror against a enemies who attacked america on 9 11 01 amp expressing our thanks to our troops whove made that success possible
172667 a obvious fact that a terrorists who carried out a september 11 2001 terror attacks operated out of afghanistan not iraq
172668 prevented a u s from sending more troops where ay are needed in afghanistan
172669 a enemies who attacked america on 9 11 01 also suggests he thinks al qaeda is or at least has been a principal cause of violence in iraq thats completely wrong too
172670 a u s has not been fighting al qaeda its been fighting iraqis
172671 sacred space amp holy war a politics culture amp history of shiite islam
172672 is technically defined as someone who pledges fealty to osama bin laden amp is given a terror operation to carry out its kind of like a mafia

172674 ay are embattled with an outside shia group a mahdi army
172675 it is an open question as to whear al qaeda is a unified operating organization at all

172677 i wanted to get a feel from those guys if they like me here as a player and they wanted me here
172678 mr walsh and coach dantoni said lets not mince words we want to have you here in new york and we love your game and how its going to fit into the system but we agreed on the fact that if your main goal is to improve this franchise then youve got to listen to all offers that come through for every player at this point

172686 discovery consists of seeing what everyone else has seen and thinking what no one else has ever thought
172687 further information revealed to us that sometime around 3pm on wednesday one of the females was in the water and she was walking when it is believed that she fell into a hole some are describing it as a blue hole
172688 the other two females saw her distress and they went to assist her
172689 it was at this time that they too became a part of this perilous situation and it is believed that they all lost their lives as a result of this very very unfortunate incident
172690 investigations are continuing by officers there assisted by officers from the capital
172691 at this point we do not know conclusively if this was in fact a blue hole but it was sufficient to overwhelm her and to create the fallout effects for those persons who came to rescue her
172692 absolutely not these persons were there on the beach with bishop harcourt pinder who is the father and his wife hazel pinder and another young daughter
172693 i believe that i would be the first bahamian coach to accomplish that feat i also want to add bahamians to my program because i believe they can contribute a lot
172694 being a bahamian coaching at the ncaa level my first order of business was to identify the best team in the conference and then build a team of my own around the players i had available however with the school fully funding scholarships i was able to recruit athletes from texas california and south florida to take the program to a new level
172695 we have done so much in the short period of four years and i am really excited because the future looks great for our program
172696 four years ago i never thought that i would have this much success but i found success early which has given me a platform to work from i dont know where the national program is for the bahamas but the only way we are going to have success is meeting the right people and hopefully i can get involve here at some level
172697 our short term goal at liberty is to win our conference championship every year and secure a spot in the ncaa tournament
172698 i know my wife sonja shanes mother is also proud of his accomplishments at liberty university for a long time it has been a dream of his to coach at a usa college university

172705 well we paid you for the design we own it now
172706 we still have some legal issues to resolve and in due course after sentencing we will be lodging an appeal
172707 there are always issues and there are some particular issues in this case i dont want to go into the grounds but there are some substantial ones
172708 at the end of the day the question is has the person received a fair trial if there are deficiencies in the summing up and the way it proceeds the defence is entitled to proceed and i am saying that there are matters to be canvassed
172709 to get through the other end of a second trial is a hell of a relief
172710 it is a very big relief to the police officers who have been involved in this we are very close to the family of james te aute and the other victims in this and part of it was relief on our part on their behalf

172717 exxon like most of its peers is facing an uphill battle maintaining let alone growing its oil and gas production
172718 stock fell thursday not so much due to the earnings but rather because of the market and the fact that the entire oil sector traded down in response to the decline in crude prices
172719 there now appears to be a degree of durability in gains

172723 i really do wonder if the pendulum has been allowed to swing too far to the benefit of debtors
172724 for some people the access to relief from their debts is just too easy
172725 these latest statistics could well get much worse due to the effect of increased household energy costs and higher borrowing costs

172735 i believe that when people are asking for tax relief we here at the local level can do the right thing and bring that millage level down
172736 im going to vote against this budget because i feel so strongly about not raising taxes at this time
172737 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
172738 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
172739 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
172740 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
172741 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
172742 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
172743 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
172744 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
172745 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
172746 the voters we need to get are people not a whole unlike obama
172747 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
172748 are you better off now than you were four years ago
172749 i know there are a bunch of rumors out there that rick had done something that was questionable from a character standpoint none of that is true
172750 i tried to be lenient with them but wanted to punish them
172751 i wanted to show them there was a better way than the way they were going
172752 i will not repeat them but they had something to do with sex
172753 it is the victims call whether or not they want to prosecute
172754 i have been getting a lot of feedback and e mails in protest
172755 we were really stranded and had no idea if they would come back but they came back
172756 the two young white men came to our rescue they used their gas cans and came back with 2 gallons put it in the car for us and went on their way
172757 around 32 cents is the cheapest i remember so it cost them 60 something cents
172758 i have a buick and it uses a lot of gas
172759 i cant believe the price and i dont think its necessary but theres not much we can do except use public transportation and even that is going up because they have to use gas too
172760 my buddy had a model a he let me drive a lot
172761 we would always go on double dates together we lived 25 miles west of cleveland and we would drive into the city
172762 i was fairly independently wealthy then because i played trumpet in dance bands for high school dances for 1 50 and on the weekends made show cards for a department store
172763 at 70 mph on cruise control with no wind i can get about 30 miles per gallon which is what i got out of my old buicks and i have had all kinds of cars
172764 we never had to worry about a license back then
172765 i got a plymouth and went up to canada and when we got up to minnesota and crossed over to north dakota we stopped for gas
172766 gas was 10 gallons for 1 and a chicken dinner at the nearby diner was 25 cents
172767 there was a lot of talk in 2004 that latinos might be becoming more republican
172768 hes going to have to take a very aggressive stand
172769 the fact that he hasnt done that yet has hurt him
172770 ho perso il mio angelo custode vuoi essere tu adesso

172772 i dont think they thought through what it will do to little people
172773 if youre sitting on a valuable piece of property youd think you would expect to pay more taxes
172774 hes a very civic oriented gentleman and wants to see it happen
172775 if you dont want any telephone poles thats what it takes
172776 the one single thing that you could do that improves the quality of the environment is to get rid of the power lines
172777 its going to increase your property values its going to make the system more reliable its silly to pinch that particular penny
172778 one problem that we and i think a lot of winter park residents have had over the years is dealing with power crews who butcher the trees in order to maintain the lines
172779 from that perspective alone the under grounding was a great idea
172780 i have been thinking about this property for years i plan to restore it to its past glory
172781 as the months have gone on ive seen less and less of him
172782 i think he suspected that once we just turned the lights on we would be surrounded by hordes of people
172783 he e mailed me and said meet me at the corner of orange and church i want to show you my vision
172784 he brought me to this space and said this is where i want you to be at that time lets face it cameron was like a rock star
172785 weve had to make some adjustments but the plan is to go forward with that site
172786 whoever comes in whether its broad street or someone else we can still partner with them and go forward
172787 if i must choose between righteousness and peace i choose righteousness
172788 bis jetzt hat die partei immer nur sanktionen gegen leute aus dem linken fl gel verh ngt die spd wird aber nicht glaubw rdiger dadurch dass sie immer nur nach links ausschlie t
172789 ich hatte damals geschrieben die spd werde unter schmidt so weit nach rechts driften dass sich die cdu danach nur noch ins gemachte bett legen muss
172790 wenn das schon parteisch digend ist dann sind es doch die u erungen des prominenten sozialdemokraten clement gegen andrea ypsilanti wohl erst recht
172791 hier gemacht hat das kann man nur als durchgeknallt bezeichnen
172792 es ist v llig absurd und parteisch dlich jemanden wie wolfgang clement auszuschlie en
172793 einen kurs der die mitte w hler der spd bindet
172794 die fr her bei helmut schmidt waren die gerhard schr der dann gebunden hat die clement gebunden hat
172795 noch mehr w hler in der mitte die sie ja dringend braucht um doch wieder aus dem umfragetief herauszukommen
172796 als jurist muss ich sagen ist der ausschluss vermutlich unproblematisch das parteiengesetz gibt relativ enge voraussetzungen unter denen eine partei ihre mitglieder ausschlie en kann und diese voraussetzungen sind bei clement mit sicherheit erf llt
172797 und da sind dinge zu ber cksichteigen wie die biografie der werdegang des mitglieds die verdienste um die partei aber eben eventuell auch der politische schaden den ein ausschluss hervorruft
172798 nat rlich problematisch weil clement ein sehr profiliertes und ein sehr prominentes mitglied der spd ist
172799 was kannst du machen wenn der gegner derart gut serviert meine spiele gegen karlovic sind immer so verlaufen bislang kippten die partien immer irgendwie auf meine seite heute ist das leider nicht passiert

172804 we can print them off in strips and make them as big as a garage door if we wanted to
172805 they come totally equipped with printers plotters satellite access and generators theyre pretty handy units but we seem to make this work

172807 tactical units must rapidly and reliably use sensor networks to track potential targets collect send and receive actionable intelligence and automatically receive warning of impending dangers the wtsr program is aimed at providing expeditionary forces with that kind of enhanced battle space awareness
172808 the wtsr program will help to overcome that problem as well as a number of other key limitations associated with conventional sensor technology

172814 the coordinators of sundays auction of 41 units at the new eight orchids condominium midrise in oakland billed the event as a means of finding the actual market value for such homes among the dozen transactions recorded by the chronicle sales prices ranged between 25 3 and 34 percent off the original asking price
172815 the market has definitely humbled us said stuart gruendl ceo of project developer bayrock residential of oakland
172816 bayrock has been taking reservations for eight orchids a 157 unit complex at seventh street and broadway on the edge of chinatown since february 2007 as of early last month it had sold 20 units fewer than two per month
172817 one of the early single bedroom condos sold for 316 000 up from a starting bid of 245 000 but well below the original 435 888 asking price the auction for a three bedroom three bathroom town home started at 475 000 stalled around 528 000 and then quickly ran up to 534 000
172818 that was nearly 34 percent off the list price of 805 888
172819 on the other hand one winning woman walked out of the auction room crying tears of obvious joy with her family members smiling and offering congratulatory hugs nobody offered me a consoling hug gruendl later joked
172820 all 41 of the homes put up for auction received bids above the minimum ken stevens ceo of the west coast division of accelerated marketing said the auction would be used to establish the price for remaining homes at eight orchids
172821 more difficult to evaluate is what the auction will mean for the broader oakland or east bay market experts say pall those auctions will end up in some appraisers book said christopher thornberg an economist with beacon economics of los angeles
172822 that kind of discount could be attributed to their location as much as to the overall market and credit situation said patrick duffy principal with metrointelligence real estate advisors in los angeles
172823 the particular challenge for oakland developers is that several large condo developments have opened or begun selling the past year these builders are selling only a few units per month on average according to san francisco research firm mark co
172824 the eight orchids discounts could be unwanted news for those who have bought downtown oakland condos during the past few months especially if they settled on a unit in the chinatown building itself gruendl acknowledged there is a gap between what early buyers paid and the amounts agreed to at the auction
172825 but not enough that existing homeowners should lose sleep he said

172889 we delivered gross margin of 43 1 per cent the seventh consecutive quarter of year over year improvement
172890 primarily from customer mix due to the recognition of higher margin deferred revenues and cost reduction initiatives partially offset by the negative impacts of price erosion and product mix
172891 faces a challenging business environment with increasing risk due to general macroeconomic weakness continuing competitive pressures and potential of further reduced capex spending by key north american cdma customers
172892 this performance was carried by upstream activities which showed once again the good sensitivity of results to high prices for hydrocarbons

172948 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
172949 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
172950 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
172951 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
172952 because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they dont need to be protected from environmental contaminants
172953 solar cell makers can add super cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity
172954 the current fad in china for push ups is not inspired by the approach of the olympic games nor is it part of a campaign to improve physical fitness in a country that employs a vast bureaucracy to monitor all types of internet activity and where posting a comment critical of the authorities can land you in re education camp people have to choose their words very carefully so they resort to euphemisms to evade the cyber spies and skirt the automated keyword blocking tools which the chinese authorities use to keep tabs on the online world when a chinese blogger says im just doing push ups

172972 rejoice always pray without ceasing in all circumstances give thanks for this is the will of god for you in christ jesus do not quench the spirit
172973 when the spirit dwells in a person from the moment in which that person has become prayer he never leaves him for the spirit himself never ceases to pray in him whether the person is asleep or awake prayer never from then on departs from his soul whether he is eating or drinking or sleeping or whatever else he is doing even in deepest sleep the fragrance of prayer rises without effort in hid heart prayer never again deserts him at every moment of his life even when it appears to stop it is secretly at work in him continuously one of the fathers the bearers of christ says that prayer is the silence of the pure for their thoughts are divine motions the movements of the heart and the intellect that have been purified are the voices full of sweetness with which such people never cease to sing in secret to the hidden god
172974 see what love the father has bestowed on us that we may be called the children of god yet so we are the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him beloved we are gods children now what we shall be has not yet been revealed we do know that when it is revealed we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is everyone who has this hope based on him makes himself pure as he is pure everyone who commits sin commits lawlessness for sin is lawlessness
172975 every spiritual being is by nature a temple of god created to receive into itself the glory of god
172976 jesus in whom the fullness of god dwells has become our home by making his home in us he allows us to make our home in him by entering into the intimacy of our innermost self he offers us the opportunity to enter into his own intimacy with god by choosing us as his preferred dwelling place he invites us to choose him as our preferred dwelling place this is the mystery of the incarnation here we come to see what discipline in the spiritual life means it means a gradual process of coming home to where we belong and listening there to the voice which desires our attention home is the place where that first love dwells and speaks gently to us prayer is the most concrete way to make our home in god

172988 simply defies understanding consenting adults told not to use birth control preposterous third world parents deprived access to contraception and abortion positively criminal a ban on condoms when theres a risk of contracting aids beneath contempt
172989 if theres anything on earth that unites the churchs adversaries the teaching against contraception is probably it
172990 four decades later not only have the documents signature predictions been ratified in empirical force
172991 but they have been ratified as few predictions ever are in ways its authors could not possibly have foreseen including by information that did not exist when the document was written by scholars and others with no interest whatever in its teaching and indeed even inadvertently and in more ways than one by many proud public adversaries of the church
172992 honest social scientists willing to follow the data wherever it may lead
172993 explained in the language of modern economics why the sexual revolution had led to an increase in both illegitimacy and abortion
172994 contraception to the breakdown of families female impoverishment trouble in the relationship between the sexes and single motherhood
172995 tiger has further argued as humanae vitae did not explicitly though other works of catholic theology have for a causal link between contraception and abortion stating outright that with effective contraception controlled by women there are still more abortions than ever
172996 a general lowering of moral standards throughout society a rise in infidelity a lessening of respect for women by men and the coercive use of reproductive technologies by governments
172997 when advertisements for sex scream from every billboard and webpage and every teen idol is sooner or later revealed topless or worse online some might wonder what further proof could possibly be offered
172998 feminist literature has been a remarkably consistent and uninterrupted cacophony of grievance recrimination and sexual discontent in that forty year record we find as nowhere else personal testimony of what the sexual revolution has done to womankind
172999 the signature metaphors of feminism say everything we need to know about how happy liberation has been making these women the suburban home as concentration camp men as rapists children as intolerable burdens fetuses as parasites and so on these are the sounds of liberation even the vaunted right to abortion both claimed and exercised at extraordinary rates did not seem to mitigate the misery of millions of these women after the sexual revolution
173000 is responsible for deadening male libido in relation to real women and leading men to see fewer and fewer women as porn worthy
173001 contraception has released males to a historically unprecedented degree from responsibility for their sexual aggression
173002 if contraceptive intercourse is permissible then what objection could there be after all to mutual masturbation or copulation in vase indebito sodomy buggery i should perhaps remark that i am using a legal term here not indulging in bad language when normal copulation is impossible or inadvisable or in any case according to taste
173003 it cant be the mere pattern of bodily behavior in which the stimulation is procured that makes all the difference but if such things are all right it becomes perfectly impossible to see anything wrong with homosexual intercourse for example i am not saying if you think contraception all right you will do these other things not at all the habit of respectability persists and old prejudices die hard but i am saying you will have no solid reason against these things you will have no answer to someone who proclaims as many do that they are good too you cannot point to the known fact that christianity drew people out of the pagan world always saying no to these things because if you are defending contraception you will have rejected christian tradition
173004 if paul vi was right about so many of the consequences deriving from contraception it is because he was right about contraception itself
173005 is exactly the connection few people in 2008 want to make because contraceptive sex is the fundamental social fact of our time despite an empirical record that is unmistakably on paul vis side by now there is extraordinary resistance to crediting catholic moral teaching with having been right about anything no matter how detailed the record
173006 instead of vindication for the church there is demoralization instead of clarity mass confusion instead of more obedience ever less really the perversity is well perverse in what other area does humanity operate at this level of extreme daily constant contradiction
173007 empowered by the spirit a new generation of christians is being called to help build a world in which gods gift of life is welcomed respected and cherished not rejected feared as a threat and destroyed
173008 world youth day 2008 in sydney reveal his conviction that we are beginning a new missionary age for the church the successor of peter and vicar of christ benedict xvi is convinced that the young will lead it

173016 i ceased to advertise my mothers race at the age of 12 or 13 when i began to suspect that by doing so i was ingratiating myself to whites
173017 i found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mothers race
173018 i will stand with the muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction

173042 that surely gives us a picture of a great deal that is happening at the present time this is one of the problems confronting the christian church today this affluent society in which we are living is drugging people and making them feel that all is well with them they have better wages better houses better cars every gadget desirable in the home life is satisfactory and all seems to be well and because of that people have ceased to think and to face the real problems they are content with this superficial ease and satisfaction and that militates against a true and a radical understanding of their actual condition and of course this is aggravated at the present time by many other agencies there is the pleasure mania and television and radio are bringing their influence right into the home all these things persuade man that all is well they give him temporary feelings of happiness and so he assumes that all is well and stops thinking the result is that he does not realize his true position and then face it
173043 its funny people always say that girls get to go first but boys are always president so boys get to be president and girls get to go first on everything

173073 i do not know her that much to criticize or to judge her feelings towards what happened thats why i do not want to talk anything about that
173074 masaya ko sa nangyari sa fashion show after knowing yung response ng tao pagkatapos mismo ng fashion show pero during that time the show itself wala talaga akong kaalam alam talaga kasi nga yung focus ko sa pagrampa ko
173075 kumbaga lahat ng comments these are all comments kumbaga iba ibang tao ang nagsasabi sa akin maaaring yung nagsabi sa akin yun ang tumili walang nagsabi sa akin na tumili lahat sinasabi nila nagustuhan nila
173076 but on the other hand para sa akin hindi importante sa akin kung ano ang naging reaction basta ginawa ko ang kailangan kong gawin as a model nag rehearse naman ako
173077 hindi lihim yun i even rehearsed on the day itself i dont think theres an artist who rehearsed on the day of the show itself pero ako nag rehearse pa ko sa mismong araw na yun
173078 you know what bench is an institution its a global company that wouldnt engage itself to intrigues or whatever that will jeopardize its beauty or the brand they should know better
173079 para sa akin hindi sila magpapagulo kahit kanino lalo na sa akin na bago lang ako sino ba naman ako bago lang ako sa bench family ako i gave what was assigned to me with artistry and taste para sa akin yun lang kasi meron akong gustong gawin meron akong gustong patunayan and it ends there without meron akong gustong patunayan sa iba wala kundi para sa sarili ko lang
173080 people will always have their own interpretation and i respect that what matters most to me is that ginawa ko kung ano ang gusto ko allowed verified and patented by bench para sa akin thats all that matters nag enjoy ako nag enjoy ang pamilya ko nag enjoy ang mga mahal ko sa buhay na nanonood para sa akin yun ang importante dahil nang rumarampa ako wala naman akong ibang naririnig
173081 people will always have their own opinion no matter what even the best thing in the world may be the worse for other people as long as for those who believe that this is good as long as it matters and for me i believe that what happened to me was good for people na nandoon para tumangkilik it was good din and thank you sa kanila
173082 unang una i dont believe na may sabotage na nangyari because kung meron man kahit ako hindi ako papayag because in everything that i do im fair with what explained to us we just follow all the rules and wala namang nangyaring ganoon
173083 i do not know her that much to criticize or to judge her feelings towards what happened thats why i do not want to talk anything about that
173084 richard never said any bad things about me since he started ive been his supporter in fact bilib ako on how he handles his career even before the show weve been supporting each other
173085 oh yes ako rin naman in fact in every endeavor of his kino congratulate ko siya because were on the same industry i know he has his own niche and to his niche he excels no one else will replace him nag umpisa siya inalagaan niya at nag iisa siya riyan
173086 alam nyo sana huwag e kasi ako i consider ourselves as teammates rather than rivals the truth is were on the same network so in fact naging director pa niya ko nang maging star siya ng
173087 i believe were part of the same team so sana huwag naman lagyan na parang pag personalin kaming dalawa
173088 hindi ko alam eh i feel that instead of us pondering on the time na ma hurt tayo dapat hindi eh
173089 malayo kasi sa interpretasyon nila yun nirerespeto ko yun wala akong kinokontra but at the end of the day there are facts and there are people who will attest to what they believed in so hindi natin puwedeng baguhin yun but i do not take it against anybody
173090 at the end of the day i will respect kung anuman ang sabihin nila much more my friendship with the gentleman richard gutierrez

173109 a genial giant of a man nate thurmond was one of the all time great nba centers with a rugged in your face style of play that frequently intimidated even kareem abdul jabbar and wilt chamberlain the hall of famer played 14 professional seasons in the 1960s and 1970s posting career averages of 15 0 points and 15 0 rebounds per game among the all time nba leaders in career rebounds and rebounding average thurmond was selected to play in seven nba all star games and was selected to the nba all defensive first or second team five times he still holds the nba record for most rebounds in a quarter with 18 and he owns the distinction of being the first player ever to record a quadruple double some basketball observers have suggested that the 6 11 thurmond provided the best mix of offense and defense in basketball history many say that his defense was better than chamberlains and that his offense was better than bill russells with quickness and long hands a smooth outside shooting touch tenacious rebounding classic shotblocking ability and a total team attitude thurmond offered a perfectly balanced package the san francisco warriors selected thurmond with the third overall pick in the 1963 nba draft behind art heyman of duke and rod thorn of west virginia thurmond played 11 seasons for the warriors becoming nearly as familiar in the bay area as the golden gate bridge thurmond spent his rookie season as an apprentice to chamberlain who had come into the league with the philadelphia warriors in 1959 and then moved with the franchise to san francisco in 1962 while chamberlain was averaging 36 9 points and 22 3 rebounds in 1963 64 thurmond put up modest numbers in limited playing time still his 7 0 points and 10 4 rebounds per contest earned him a berth on the nba all rookie team

173113 the idea that four months before a presidential election a candidate can run through these countries meet some world leaders and claim experience in these matters may impress the liberal media but to me it exposes just how unprepared for the presidency this guy is i have never seen a presidential candidate with less to offer this nation yet with more arrogance and self delusion than barack obama

173177 ada surat cinta dari uki mbak katanya dengan senang hati kubaca surat dari uki namun air mata tertetes di pipiku karena bukan surat indah yang kubayangkan seperti dulu melainkan surat bahwa ayahnya tidak setuju kalau uki mencintai delima gelap gulita pandanganku dan lemas aku duduk di bangku kios mama tak ada rasa malu di lihat orang lewat kenapa aku duduk menagis di situ hanya akulah yang tahu kenapa aku menangis saat itu dengan sedih kubalas pula surat uki dear uki sayang dengan sedih hati ima menulis surat ini untukmu sesedih saat ima membaca suratmu yang menyatakan bahwa papamu melarang cinta kita apa yang harus kita lakukan untuk mewujudkan cinta kita ini

173190 panpel persib sudah mengajukan jadwal ulang dua pertandingan itu ke bli diharapkan secepatnya ada keputusan
173191 surat tertulisnya belum kami terima namun peluangnya sangat kecil terlebih jadwal itu berdekatan dengan jadwal pilwalkot bandung
173192 minggu depan panpel akan beraudiensi dengan kapolda jabar terkait hal itu termasuk membahas perijinan pertandingan kandang persib lainnya

173194 ini adalah siklus tahunan seperti yang sudah diperkirakan pada juli sebetulnya tidak nampak lagi pengaruh kenaikan harga bbm meski inflasi tinggi
173195 dari 66 kota seluruh kota mengalami inflasi dengan inflasi tertinggi terjadi di manokwari 4 33 persen dan terendah di banda aceh 0 25 persen
173196 kalau kita lihat pendorong inflasi tetap pada bahan makanan dengan inflasi 1 85 persen karena persoalan di pasar riil artinya ada masalah pasokan
173197 pada sisi perumahan masih ada kenaikan harga elpiji sampai 12 3 persen untuk semua jenis biasanya ini lebih karena masalah distribusi
173198 kita masih punya selisih sekitar 2 3 persen hingga akhir tahun sesuai dengan target pemerintah ini berati sekitar 0 5 persen setiap bulannya
173199 inflasi yang tinggi pada juli baik inflasi year on year atau tahun kalender menuntut keseriusan pemerintah untuk menyeimbangkan sisi pasokan dan permintaan melalui perbaikan infrastruktur seperti jalan raya listrik ataupun transportasi serta efisiensi energi dan listrik

173221 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
173222 let go of the old ones weve got some new ones
173223 nana ti ricordi la prima volta che ci siamo incontrate
173224 while you here do snoring lie open eyed conspiracy his time doth take
173225 let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of september the 11th malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves away from the guilty
173226 if the american people had ever known the truth about what we bushes have done to this nation we would be chased down in the streets and lynched
173227 the war in iraq is a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation out of these troubled times a new world order can emerge
173228 from the days of sparticus weishophf karl marx trotski belacoon rosa luxenburg and ema goldman this world conspiracy has been steadily growing this conspiracy played a definite recognizable role in the tragedy of the french revolution it has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the 19th century and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of europe and america have gripped the russian people by the hair of their head and have become the undisputed masters of that enormous empire
173229 the ruling class has the schools and press under its thumb this enables it to sway the emotions of the masses
173230 if it is not in the media it did not happen if it did not happen but is in the media we believe it has happened
173231 the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes
173232 all we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the new world order
173233 people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands
173234 the governments of the present day have to deal not merely with other governments with emperors kings and ministers but also with the secret societies which have everywhere their unscrupulous agents and can at the last moment upset all the governments plans
173235 the real truth of the matter is as you and i know that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the u s since the days of andrew jackson
173236 in politics nothing happens by accident if it happened you can bet it was planned that way
173237 give me control of a nations money and i care not who makes the laws
173238 the government which was designed for the people has got into the hands of the bosses and their employers the special interests an invisible empire has been set up above the forms of democracy
173239 since i entered politics i have chiefly had mens views confided to me privately some of the biggest men in the us in the field of commerce and manufacture are afraid of something they know that there is a power somewhere so organized so subtle so watchful so interlocked so complete so pervasive that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it
173240 i am a most unhappy man i have unwillingly ruined my country a great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit our system of credit is concentrated in the hands of a few men
173241 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists
173242 behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people to destroy this invisible government to befoul this unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of today
173243 to achieve world government it is necessary to remove from the minds of men their individualism loyalty to family traditions national patriotism and religious dogmas
173244 it is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system for if they did i believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning
173245 the one aim of these financiers is world control by the creation of inextinguishable debts
173246 here were talking about plastic knives and using an american airlines flight filed with our citizens and the missile to damage this building and similar inaudible that damaged the world trade center
173247 and i think all of us have a sense if we imagine the kind of world we would face if the people who bombed the mess hall in mosul or the people who did the bombing in spain or the people who attacked the united states in new york shot down the plane over pennsylvania and attacked the pentagon
173248 the real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over city state and nation like the octopus of real life it operates under cover of a self created screen at the head of this octopus are the rockefeller standard oil interests and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as international bankers the little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the us government for their own selfish purposes they practically control both political parties
173249 those who cast the votes decide nothing those who count the votes decide everything
173250 fifty men have run america and thats a high figure
173251 the real rulers in washington are invisible amp exercise their power from behind the scenes
173252 i am concerned for the security of our great nation not so much because of any threat from without but because of the insideous forces working from within
173253 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
173254 were the tools amp vassals of rich men behind the scenes were the jumping jacks they pull the strings amp we dance our talents our possibilities amp our lives are all the property of other men we are intellectual prostitutes
173255 i believe that if the people of this nation fully understood what congress has done to them over the last 49 years they would move on washington they would not wait for an election it adds up to a preconceived plan to destroy the economic and social independence of the united states
173256 the high office of president has been used to foment a plot to destroy the americans freedom and before i leave office i must inform the citizen of his plight
173257 all of us will ultimately be judged on the effort we have contributed to building a new world order
173258 for more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well publicized incidents such as my encounter with castro to attack the rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over american political and economic institutions some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the united states characterizing my family and me as internationalists and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure one world if you will if that is the charge i stand guilty and i am proud of it
173259 if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them around the banks will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered
173260 to repress rebellion is to maintain the status quo a condition which binds the mortal creature in a state of intellectual or physical slavery but it is impossible to chain man merely by slaving his body the mind must also be held and to accomplish this fear is the accepted weapon the common man must fear life fear death fear god fear the devil and fear most the overlords the keepers of his destiny
173261 if we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without them knowing it
173262 the conscious and intelligent maniplulation of organized habits and opinions of hte mses is an important element in a democratic society those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power in our country we are governed our minds are molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of we are dominated by a relatively small number of persons it is they who pull the wires which control the public mind and who harness social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world
173263 the sick individual finds himself at home with all other similarly sick individuals the whole culture is geared to this kind of pathology the result is that the average individual does not experience the separateness and isolation the fully schizophrenic person feels he feels at ease among those suffer from the same deformation in fact it is the fully sane person who feels isolated int he insane society and he may suffer so much from the incapacity to communicate that it is he who may become psychotic
173264 when in group narcissism the object is not the individual but he group to which he belongs
173265 dont believe anything you see or hear from the media everyone including me is intentionally or unintentionally lying to you the things i say are being related to you through a flawed language system
173266 its an absolute honour for me to be the manager here an absolute honour
173267 ill do everything i can to bring success to this football club
173268 if you tell me we will win the league and not beat rangers all season then i would take it
173269 if hed been english or swedish hed have walked the england job
173270 anybody who can do anything in leicester but make a jumper has got to be a genius
173271 we already knew the economy was weak and now you have both a negative growth number coupled with job losses
173272 macro investors are torn between two views were in something like the 1970s or were in something like the 1930s
173273 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
173274 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
173275 now we have to figure out whether these motor neurons are able to mature
173276 for these to be useful for drug development we need mature motor neurons
173277 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
173278 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
173279 just remember that the the news media has the attention span of a fruit fly so this will fade as long as we dont lose another one

173296 mccain and romney would be like oil and water we arent against mormonism but romney is not a thoroughgoing evangelical and his flip flopping on issues is understandable in a liberal state like massachusetts but our people wont understand that
173297 i will vote for mccain unless he does one thing you know what that is if he puts romney on the ticket as veep it will alienate the entire evangelical community 62 million self professing evangelicals in this country half of them registered to vote are going to be deeply saddened

173317 money success and fame have not gone to my head i carelessly erred in the past due to my eagerness to help the tamils if given a chance i will do much more to help people of karnataka

173321 i shall discharge my functions entrusted to this office more as a duty rather than as an authority the non party character of the office of the speaker in our parliamentary polity places on me a special obligation to be totally non partisan and judicious while regulating the proceedings of the house so long as i occupy this exalted chair i assure you that i shall always strive to protect to the best of my ability the rights and privileges of the house and of its members irrespective of their political affiliations
173322 honble members i can assure you that to me all the honble members are of the same status and are entitled to the same facilities irrespective of the party to which one may belong and will be entitled to the same opportunity the only status that i recognize is that all of you are elected as honble members of this great institution
173323 a lot of speculation is going on in the media regarding the position of the speaker of the lok sabha comrade somnath chatterjee i have already stated that any decision will be taken by the speaker himself this has been reiterated by the speaker through a statement by his office on july 10 2008 we do not want the office of the speaker being dragged into any unnecessary controversy
173324 on the day we withdrew support from the upa government i had stated in a press conference that it is for the speaker to take a decision on the matter i have maintained this all through as for the role of the speaker i wish to make our partys views clear by holding the post of the speaker a person does not cease to have political affiliations but when someone becomes a speaker he she should not indulge in party activities or adopt partisan political positions
173325 is an infcirc 66 type safeguards agreement based on the agencys standard safeguards practices and procedures
173326 more efficient mechanism for ensuring that safeguards requirements can be met
173327 it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
173328 such an umbrella approach could also be used for the conclusion of other 66 type safeguards agreements
173329 the termination provisions contained in the agreement are the same for other 66 type agreements
173330 natually as with all safeguards agreements this agreement is subject to the general rules of international law therefore the agreement should be read as an integral whole the preamble provides for contextual background and safeguards are implemented in accordance with the terms of the agreement
173331 little different than those of other agreements based on infcirc 66
173332 safeguards would be applied to nuclear facilities in india using the same methods applied elsewhere in the world
173333 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible

173384 a lot of kids are looking for attention theyre looking for a way to measure their own popularity and they measure it now on page views
173385 the faster we can get any of the networks to take down such content the less likely it is that kids are going to keep doing it because they do it for the fame factor
173386 what it means amp to glorify violence in the way we do across all sectors of society
173387 the internet mirrors back to us what weve instilled as cultural values and when we look at that mirror we dont like what we see
173388 there should be more responsibility on the part of the networking sites to police themselves

173405 quite a large amount of petrol spilt down the front of his body on his arms midsection and belly
173406 he was quite clearly heavily drenched with the accelerant and smelt strongly of it
173407 mr white then flicked the lighter on which caused the accelerant to immediately ignite and effectively turn mr kinsey into a human fireball
173408 no doubt mr kinsey genuinely believed he was about to die and started screaming to that effect
173409 as a result of the fire mr kinsey sustained 20 per cent burns to his body in particular his abdomen chest legs and arms
173410 he sustained a mixture of superficial burns but at least four per cent of the burns were deep
173411 i have three children i cannot play with or cuddle my two year old or one year old because they do not understand the nature of my injuries
173412 i also have a son who is five years old and i cannot wrestle with him like i used to
173413 i sleep poorly and i wake up three or four times a night because of pain
173414 i suffer from a recurring nightmare where i see lots of flames and someone is one fire but i cannot see his face
173415 i can no longer look at my body in the same way
173416 there can be no doubt that effect of this incident has been a very serious one from mr kinseys point of view and has left him with a considerable disability
173417 i have no doubt that fearful injuries inflicted on this occasion amount to grievous bodily harm and that they were caused by your unlawful and thoroughly irresponsible act
173418 at first i could smell the fire and i could feel it was really hot on my face because i was running around screaming and then i felt it through the first layer of my skin
173419 i could hear everyone screaming and telling me to get on the floor and save my face
173420 my boss suddenly came out of nowhere with a blanket and just jumped on me all my colleagues had burn marks on their wrists from where they were helping me
173421 i am just shocked i never had a problem with him we worked together for three years
173422 i needed to come to court to see him and show him what my body was like and show him what i was feeling i hope he never has one of those silly moments again and does it to someone else it was very hard to come here
173423 he hit her once and she just dropped and rolled my dog heard her screaming and bolted down and chased him off
173424 my mum is 65 years old and about five and a half foot
173425 her whole body is sore where she has dropped to the ground
173426 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why

173443 there is no such thing as compromise you either win or you lose

173445 all i can say is they the iraqis are establishing the rule of law theyre going to be having elections and i think theyre becoming an effective government which is what our strategy was thanks to the genius of a guy named david petraeus
173446 occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
173447 but the fact is we did win easily it was terribly mismanaged
173448 what he really enjoys although the witnesses seldom do is to put opposing witnesses on the same panel and sit back and watch them fight and see who has the best argument
173449 im happy with the way our campaign is run it should be chaotic i should have mark salter and steve and rick and charlie and these guys on the line arguing with each other and saying baloney
173450 mccain is quite lively and dexterous intellectually he seems willing to listen to criticism and reevaluate positions and he doesnt mind being challenged
173451 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
173452 we can all stand a little self improvement from time to time but its hard to accomplish when you have reached my age

173494 last month the fcc focused attention on the thorny problem of early termination fees as commission chairman kevin martin said he favored a nationwide resolution of termination fees he also suggested that termination fees more accurately track the actual cost of phones given to consumers a 50 phone would call for a lower termination fee than a 250 phone for instance

173722 there is no evidence of any kind of excessive force here
173723 he was shouting obscenities and had attempted to physically assault officers
173724 one fall from a taser doesnt put that on your face
173725 when youre down on the floor kicking fighting there are going to be cuts and bruises
173726 he tried to remove the groceries anyway but left the cart when confronted by store personnel
173727 im not making any accusations i just want the truth
173728 is the 5d replacement collecting in the warehouses we had this comment thanks from a visitor to a jessops store in the uk
173729 the canon rep has told them the 5d replacement has started shipping and is in the uk already insufficient quantities to release as yet though unfortunately they werent able to give me any specs or details as the canon guy didnt know anything
173730 nothing is for certain on anything concerning the postals newbie and veteran alike can mess up or become a black hole gray hole because of sickness or other such things
173731 barack obama has played the elderly white republican card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
173732 hes just trying to scare the young non white democrats into not voting for john
173733 most of the players id say about 99 9 per cent want to go to the olympics this is a big big big deal
173734 guys want to go but theyre just being held back by their clubs theyre important for their clubs and you can understand it but i think its a great rule that they have to be released
173735 the olympics is an opportunity to be on the world stage its a huge event and everyone wants to be a part of it
173736 i can understand why the clubs want to do everything to keep their players but for the players i just think its a great tournament to be a part of
173737 i know a lot of younger players had problems with their clubs about going to the olympics but my club ajax didnt make any problems
173738 i didnt have any problems they understood that it was very important for me to play in this tournament
173739 for me this is a great competition and to let young players play is a great move from fifa
173740 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
173741 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
173742 it has not progressed over the last couple of days but the window is open until the end of august and theres still plenty of time to run
173743 i think there is absolutely no question that any deal will be done with regard to didier drogba
173744 didier is in rehab and will continue to be a chelsea player
173745 hes a professional he just goes out there and plays
173746 i say when i was in boston he was probably the best right handed hitter ive ever seen playing on a consistent basis hes that good it was a great pickup
173747 i think he will do a lot for everybodys personality for one and the fact that you certainly dont want to pitch to manny with men on base chances are the guys hitting in front of him will get some good pitches to hit
173748 thats the one thing that people for some reason think hes lazy a bad teammate and doesnt care
173749 ill do everything to be available at the start of the season im not giving up beating bad luck is one of my aims along with winning lots more with inter
173750 i liked mike a lot but thought it would be prudent to have the situation fully resolved before we move forward
173751 the ncaa did not think it was necessary to go the route of banning him from coaching i talked to a lot of people in the ncaa about it i talked with mike extensively about it in fact i know he was tired of talking about it hes been out of coaching for five years and i think hes learned his lessons he will come back stronger
173752 i enjoyed working the games for espn much more than the studio work because it was the closest thing to coaching
173753 i missed it more than i thought i missed the competition i missed traveling with the team i missed being in the locker room after wins and even after losses that forces you to come to grips with reality
173754 so you can say the good news is that we have a lot of guys coming back or the bad news is we have a lot of guys coming back im hoping its the first part
173755 once i talked with jarvis i told him i was pulling out
173756 he was easy to talk to hes a down to earth guy he said hes going to help me be a better player and help our team achieve our goals
173757 hes got a chance to be a very special leader
173758 there was no winning tradition there they hadnt made the ncaa tournament since the jfk era there wasnt a strong fan base or a lot of funding
173759 we could have just plugged in the next best xs and os guy but our program is in such a fragile existence
173760 we are fighting for a fan base and looking to promote our program
173761 mike was the best fit of anyone to manage all those things hes part of a church with 7 000 members and a lot of those people were endorsing him hes firmly entrenched in this community he lives in a very nice neighborhood here and has built up a network here
173762 its unrealistic to expect a guy to camp out here for the rest of his career
173763 but obviously we would prefer to get three or four years out of someone mainly we wanted someone with a lot of hunger we really think mike has a chip on his shoulder to get on back on top and to go out on his terms he has a fire in his belly
173764 intuitive to operate easy to reconfigure the various options and pretty much idiot proof
173765 the traffic capability is brilliant and has already saved me from sitting in queues for a couple of hours

173771 i am not sure anyone else would have done that
173772 you can do all sorts of modifications which without changing the engine means you could squeeze another three seconds out of the aeroplane
173773 of course you could squeeze more out of the pilot too
173774 if you work smoothly you can put the propeller and spinner on in an hour and a half there are six bolts this propeller seems to be the best for this kind of flying where we need high speed the previous propeller was more suitable for medium speed such as aerobatics
173775 we did two things the propeller which is a speed gainer and the wing tips which are a speed robber we know we are faster for sure so there is more gain with the propeller than loss through the wings we have five knots net with the tips we dropped three knots and gained eight with the propeller
173776 i had to go back to a setting that i knew and liked and that was a compromise now it is much much better and i am going to stick with it

173818 three days past one of the small boys came hightailing into the village from the high pasture near to redfield he would not talk nor eat just shook and cried in his mothers arms this morning my father took him into the sweat lodge and the boy spoke he said that while he played in the pasture the air shook and a great ring of black opened in it into the ring went trees and grasses dirt and rocks and animals from redfields herd then in the same time as it began it ended the ring went away and the air was still

173826 in our view the best way is to try to help the poor by direct income support targeted safety nets like food for work programmes and to avoid general subsidies which waste resources and dont help the poor
173827 for food an increase in supply is needed but production is not enough we need to be able to carry what has been produced from one country to another
173828 our focus is cash flow and liquidity that is our focus

173837 is that the lapd couldnt have done the testing we have because the technology didnt exist then

173990 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
173991 in juxtaposing barack obama with britney spears and paris hilton the mccain campaign is simply trying to plant the old racist seed of black man hitting on young white woman
173992 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
173993 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
173994 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race

174000 but on wednesday evening the weather took a turn for the worse with seven metre swells and 100 kilometre an hour winds
174001 loose items did move around the ship when she did take the sharp turn but the ship was in no danger
174002 it was a little bumpy but nothing out of the ordinary

174009 a kilo of lamb only has a carbon footprint equivalent to driving about 36 miles in a car
174010 the most important first step is to monitor energy use reduce it and become more energy efficient
174011 now we are working to replace fossil fuels with a range of low carbon alternatives such as a solar tracker to generate power a micro scale windmill to power a gate and a wood fired boiler to heat our new chick nurseries the ideal is to create renewable energy on the farm to make ourselves more self sufficient

174019 further to the announcement made on july 24th 2008 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
174020 there can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer being made for british energy group
174021 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept
174022 edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
174023 that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder in a publicly listed company it is a now matter for both boards to see how to proceed
174024 the level of interest in nuclear new build in the uk from edf and from other operators remains high
174025 recent developments in energy markets underline the need for new nuclear to combat high fossil fuel prices climate change and security of supply
174026 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
174027 edfs purchase of british energy was the governments get out of jail free card which hasnt materialised
174028 there are tough decisions to be made as the reality is britain will run short of power our crumbling infrastructure and lack of political will to sort has left assets ripe for picking off by larger european energy companies
174029 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with
174030 personas de buena fe que desean comprometerse construir una vida una uni n en base al amor y el respeto es muy apropiado que la iglesia otorgue su bendici n
174031 la postura que hemos tomado siempre es de abogar por la inclusi n de los homosexuales en la vida de la sociedad e inclusive en la vida de la iglesia
174032 creo que el valor m s importante como cristianos sigue diciendo es el amor que nos ense a a construir en comunidad a respetar a los dem s y a tolerar la diversidad de opiniones en lo que s estoy de acuerdo con el grupo de trenton es que en una democracia es muy importante que se exprese la voluntad del pueblo
174033 ser homosexual no es una decisi n que uno toma no es una opci n es lo que uno es uno nace homosexual o heterosexual no puedo cambiar si nazco mujer u hombre blanco o negro pero toda persona es hecha a semejanza de dios y todos desde el punto de vista cristiano tenemos que tomar decisiones que reflejen el amor entendido como una acci n concreta desde el punto de vista cristiano el amor siempre construye comunidad
174034 a base de respeto mutuo de tener igualdad de oportunidades para todos y respetar los derechos de todos
174035 en este momento cr tico de la vida nacional sostiene el religioso la iglesia debe optar siempre por defender los derechos de los grupos minoritarios en este pa s como los negros y los hispanos pero tambi n tenemos que acordarnos de los homosexuales qu e todav a sufren mucha discriminaci n el tema de si se les debe permitir la uni n civil o matrimonio es una cuesti n de derechos
174036 l es una trinidad padre hijo y esp ritu santo dios no tiene sexo porque si tanto hombre y mujer est n hechos a su imagen y semejanza cualquier tipo de comunidad que se forme tendr diversidad de asociaciones pero tambi n de uniones lo que m s importa es que en la pareja heterosexual u homosexual que es la relaci n m s ntima que pueda haber reine el amor el respeto

174041 there is no other elected official taking a more principled and courageous stand for the sanctity of human life than phill kline
174042 politics plays too great a role in the decision making process of that office
174043 if kline does not win on aug 5 this only criminal case in the country will go away forever
174044 phill kline has the courage to stand up for what is right no matter the political consequences he faces and neither of the other two candidates on the ballot howe in the primary and guinn in the general election have the guts it will take to see that case through
174045 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated

174104 the printing press in upper mounts in northampton is used by 39 other johnston press titles printing more than one million copies a week
174105 following a detailed review of the printing press operations within johnston press it is proposed to close the printing operation in northampton and to reduce the printing operation in peterborough
174106 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy and by re deployment to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
174107 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
174108 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective

174110 it feels good because i think every year here there has been something negative to focus on said edwards the teams first round pick in 2004
174111 youd come to camp every year and thered be some huge distraction to take the attention away from the football playing for a change all the talk is about the cleveland browns playing football thats it
174112 its not a case of worrying about this guy not coming to camp or this guy being hurt or this guy wanting more money or whos going to be the quarterback or is the coach going to stay around all that ever did was take away from the football and the overall focus
174113 id be lying if i said i thought it would happen like it has here in the past year edwards said
174114 i was on the verge of not wanting to play here any more dealing with the fans and not winning i was like all right ill get through with my contract and ill see what happens
174115 super bowl at this months opening training camp practice the expectation level is sky high presenting its own set of challenges but after where cleveland has been since 1999 no one within the browns is complaining how could they
174116 what i told the organization before we got started this year was hey it beats the alternative browns general manager
174117 this is what weve been wanting this is where you want to be now youve got to grit your teeth keep your poise and whether it goes good bad or indifferent we kind of know this is what were supposed to be doing so lets do it
174118 lets do it attitude among the browns folk i talked to this week

174192 in recent years deadly heat waves have killed dozens to hundreds of people at a time in various u s cities often catching local officials unprepared climate scientists say more killer heat waves lie ahead with global warming and city officials are taking note
174193 a number of cities especially those hard hit in the past such as chicago philadelphia and phoenix get aggressive when a heat wave emerges
174194 in recent days much of the country has experienced dangerously high heat
174195 its already started said gerald meehl senior scientist at the national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo
174196 so far this year roughly 50 people have died from the heat according to news reports
174197 a decade earlier it was chicago that was suffering with more than 700 heat deaths during that heat wave the morgue got so full that bodies were kept in refrigerated trucks most of those who died were elderly living alone and without air conditioning
174198 it was a real awakening said john wilhelm who was deputy commissioner of public health there were a number of days where the body count kept increasing and there was absolutely nothing you could do because the heat had already taken its toll it was a helpless feeling
174199 now other cities are acting before they get to that point
174200 seattle has begun educating the public about the dangers of heat and directing people to seek air conditioning
174201 after a 1993 heat wave killed at least 118 philadelphia became the first in the country to begin a heat health watch warning system its now a worldwide model for forecasting heat with 18 other metro areas copying it
174202 during a three year period that began when philadelphia instituted its system an estimated 117 lives were saved because residents knew thered be a dangerous heat wave according to an article published by the american meteorological society
174203 if a terrorist attack had occurred on march 25 when we did our survey the consequences would have been catastrophic
174204 the emergency care systems were stretched to the breaking point and had no capacity to respond to a surge of victims
174205 we cannot afford to build and maintain idle trauma facilities waiting for the tragic day we pray never comes
174206 for a really serious catastrophic acute event a nuclear detonation or widespread chemical attack where you have thousands of victims simultaneously there is no urban area that is prepared for large scale disasters
174207 it has more to do with the person making the comment or lack thereof thier form of voodoo in saying
174208 everything that lives plants animals and people has a beginning and an end some living things have a long time between their beginning and end some are alive only a short time how long or how short doesnt really matter it is still that plants or animals or persons lifetime and each lifetime is special
174209 frustrated farmers and angered activists who claimed that field burning under the old rules threatened the health of children elderly and those with respiratory ailments
174210 i think i have good reason to be optimistic about the outcome of these experiments
174211 its not only the crime rate but the seriousness of the crime
174212 were seeing that in sexual assaults and drug offenses theres a trend in more violent crimes coming into blaine county and i think thats even more significant than the 27 percent crime rate and thats something weve not seen in the past and thats whats disturbing
174213 the mission is to enter gaza without passing through the territory of israel or egypt going from international waters directly into gaza it hasnt been done since 1967 and theres reason to think that no one will interfere with us if we go because israel has said that they no longer occupy gaza so we want to put it to the test
174214 it just describes the things of what their groups intentions are and different things theyre against basically theyre against religious groups and other racial groups and their goal is to recruit members

174226 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
174227 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
174228 what should have taken hours or days has taken months or more
174229 they could have much more rapidly identified that tomatoes were excluded and they could have gotten to the peppers more quickly and saved a lot of people the stress
174230 we believe that the fda erred in not finding the source of this outbreak and we believe that the fda erred in not promptly releasing tomatoes from florida given the fact that the test done on florida tomatoes showed no sign of salmonella
174231 on behalf of tomatoes that want their good name back you should say something stronger

174237 the great strength of these lectures turned book is the sweep of their coverage instead of becoming just one more voice in the rising debate between christians and the new atheists dr mohler has chosen to provide us with masterful coverage of the dominant writers on both sides having recently worked through most of this material myself i happily attest how accurate and penetrating are mohlers surveys and assessments i know of no other introduction to this crucial debate that is as comprehensive and clear in such brief compass mohler tells us whats going on shows us how much depends on the outcome of this titanic cultural shift and provides guidance to the resources christians need to challenge the new atheism root and branch
174238 atheism remix offers a masterful analysis of and timely response to the new atheism thoughtful and insightful this readable work illuminates for scholars pastors and students alike the key issues that must be addressed in order to engage the thinking of dawkins harris hitchens and others i applaud albert mohler for his clarity and conviction in helping us understand that biblical theism is the only true alternative to the new atheism i gladly recommend this book

174249 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
174250 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
174251 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
174252 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
174253 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
174254 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
174255 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
174256 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
174257 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
174258 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
174259 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
174260 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
174261 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
174262 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
174263 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap
174264 they have to submit a cv curriculum vitae of their credentials be approved by the site editors and also confirm their e mail address when an article is posted it can be approved by an editor and this status is shown

174299 o principal problema para mim foi ter passado um m s a trabalhar com um onze base e depois quando mais importava n o ter a possibilidade de o fazer alinhar e ter de o mudar mas acredito nos meus jogadores e espero que quem entrar na equipa consiga mostrar que merece vestir a camisola do partizan

174307 the extension of the conservatorship was at the request and suggestion of britneys doctors
174308 theyve indicated that she has made great improvement but its a work in progress jamie spears doesnt want the conservatorship to last a day longer than the doctors recommend
174309 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
174310 they have to get out as soon as possible or else the case will be heavier and it will be more difficult to get them out
174311 once the case is decided and the court has made a decision it would be hard for them to get out
174312 we dont know in the first place why they have been kept so long we dont know what the charges are
174313 and for protection because we dont know exactly whats happening inside we dont know how theyre being treated
174314 so that means maybe the government has started a mission again against christian activity
174315 theyve started a new strategy probably because it is not just an accident that all this is happening in different cities at the same time they had worked on it before and they planned to move against house churches

174324 in principle this car is too fast for my thoughts
174325 when you create an item such as this its classified as an explosive device and can be charged as such so the penalties can be pretty severe
174326 thats the most disturbing thing of all somebody could have really been hurt
174327 when those bottles explode plastic could get in your eye its just not funny
174328 i think there should be some sort of punishment whether it be community service or something
174329 im sure they didnt intend to hurt people but someone could have been hurt
174330 highly recursive conditional and repetitive routines are used because they are notationally efficient but not necessarily unique as descriptions of underlying processes
174331 the possibility of causing various elementary pieces of information situated in the cells of a large array say of memory to enter into a computation process without explicitly generating a coordinate address in machine space for selecting them out of the array
174332 without specifying where or when the next available copy of a particular molecule is expected to be found or
174333 without specifying a numerical address technology was finally catching up here at last was the long awaited revolt against the intolerance of the numerical address matrix and central clock cycle for error and ambiguity in specifying
174334 can be used to invert a class of n th order matrices with only n2 arithmetic operations in addition to the scanning and discriminating required to play the solitaire game
174335 given is an actually infinite system of points the actua l infinity is worth stressing because nothing will make sense on a finite no matter how large model
174336 a universal automaton is a finite system which given an arbitrary logical proposition in form of a linear set l tape attached to it at say specified points will produce the true or false answer universal ought to have relative sense with reference to a class of problems it can decide the arbitrary means really in a class of propositions like smaller or bigger
174337 an organism any reason to be afraid of this term yet is a universal automaton which produces other automata like it in space which is inert or only randomly activated around it
174338 this universality is probably necessary to organize or resist organization by other automata
174339 unfortunately would have to involve an enormous amount of probabilistic superstructure to the outlined theory i think it should probably be omitted unless it involves the crux of the generation and evolution problem which it might
174340 interference would no longer be necessary and the machine would have grown up
174341 a new essentially logical theory is called for in order to understand high complication automata and in particular the central nervous system it may be however that in this process logic will have to undergo a pseudomorphosis to neurology to a much greater extent than the reverse
174342 what makes you so sure that mathematical logic corresponds to the way we think

174370 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
174371 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt

174373 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
174374 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
174375 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
174376 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
174377 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
174378 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
174379 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
174380 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
174381 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

174400 they live in these parts when everything else has gone they like to grow real thin
174401 thin gopher frogs you say havent heard of them either
174402 so these gopher frogs they eat anything else cant say ive seen anything but trees water and you in this forest
174403 the gopher frog is the last thing to live here before the trees claim it completely it eats the stone of the old and leaves behind the water when it has finished its job it stands straight and tall for me to see and i pull it from the water
174404 they are echoes echoes dont have no owner they just been left behind echoes always get trapped in this forest they like the green leaves in the sky up there
174405 the boss is through that way he can probably help you though you may find him somewhat crude
174406 no problem lifes a funny game isnt it whether you like it or not you take only memories and leave only footprints you can judge a mans entire life by his footprint
174407 there aint nothing for you here tenant cept maybe memories you dont know and air you aint breathing

174410 no hardly anything actually a bit about gopher frogs and a bit about the footprints we leave didnt really understand it
174411 thas cause you think too literally pardner you think a name is something definitive and words are universal when theyre just simple scratches and howls you people have the audacity to think yer big words and good conversation are in some way better and more developed than a maingey hound sniffin ass you just happen to be used to yours isall caretaker dont say much but he aint ever wrong hos yknow i reckon he told you enuff yer starting to accept yer place there anyway you should be grateful the caretaker got nothing to say to you lest he got some business with you and thas usually at the end of yer spin of the wheel in fact there he is now

174422 el curso se ha desarrollado sobre una din mica curiosa desde una l nea de seminario de encuentro de especialistas sin que se establezca una ruptura entre los ponentes y los matriculados con lo cual se crea una din mica participativa que ha sido sumamente enriquecedora
174423 canarias en un territorio hist rico de emigrantes desde siempre hemos sido tambi n el resultado de un mestizaje
174424 el hecho de que aqu se planteen reparos al fen meno migratorio cuando hemos sido siempre un pa s de emigrantes resulta parad jico cuando no frustrante en muchos sentidos lo que pasa es que hay un racismo subyacente en todo esto se habla de la tolerancia y la liberalidad del canario pero esto alcanza hasta que llega el inmigrante hasta la puerta de tu casa hay que ser solidario aunque sea por pura coherencia con nuestra propia historia
174425 es problem tica desde su art culo 3 cuando se plantea la ilegalidad de los juicios del franquismo pero no la ilegitimidad de los mismos o cuando se establece una equiparaci n entre los que defendieron la legalidad republicana y quienes fueron a por ella a carg rsela creo que es una ley que no satisface a todos los que combatimos el fascismo en espa a el r gimen franquista y que no establece las adecuadas reparaciones y deja una cantidad de cabos sueltos enormes por citar algunos
174426 en el fondo parece que lo que se pretende no es deslegitimar el r gimen franquista sino establecer una loa a lo que fue la transici n democr tica y hay que pensar que dentro de esos cabos sueltos que cito habr a que mentar las reparaciones que merecen por los saqueos y las incautaciones de que fueron v ctimas miles y miles de espa oles un asunto que queda pendiente o incluso la simbolog a del propio r gimen franquista que se except a por su valores art sticos con lo cual en los cuarteles las iglesias o hasta en la nomenclatura de las calles se mantiene

174490 berlusconi ha capito che gli elettori come prima cosa hanno chiesto di essere governati negli anni di prodi il processo decisionale sembrava sempre troppo lungo e troppo complicato e persino i decreti venivano rimessi in discussione per spegnere i dissidi interni ma anche nei primi governi berlusconi la mediazione continua tra forze della stessa coalizione dava la sensazione di gran traccheggiamento e lentezza decisionale

174498 legiferare sullonda dellemergenza dice belpietro sulla base di singoli casi per esempio eluana englaro o piergiorgio welby porta a provvedimenti troppo polizieschi o al contrario troppo liberali invece questi temi necessitano per essere affrontati a livello legislativo di un dibattito pacato e rispettoso di posizioni tra loro molto diverse

174517 the only thing jax ever destroyed was a couple of hearts back on endermoth
174518 the destroyer does not know what he carries inside him
174519 you must kill the destroyer if you do not we will die
174520 some have millions of documents in primary edms storage but they have literally no idea which ones are important thanks to centralised storage and centralised access nobody can find what they need and eveybody fears they are missing something important but contrary to the km orthodoxy you cannot actually codify knowledge it downgrades to information when stored in databases and crumbles to dust
174521 the problem with existing enterprise software is that there is simply not enough diversity of inputs to stimulate intuitive decision making which is why the most adept individuals in organisations rely on more basic offline techniques to know what is going on
174522 the information overload people face within organisations today is the worst kind the wrong sort of information with no individual control over inputs
174523 instead of trying to gather all data and then analyse it in real time we need to help people build a better radar go with the flow and trust in their own ability to sense what matters and make decisions we need more peripheral and contextual information and less sequential memo and email processing we need to create multiple paths to things we need to improve findability as peter morville says rather than focus just on storage and retrieval classification within organisations is calcification it kills context social navigation and filtering is cheaper and more effective we need a new relationship between people in companies we are hard wired for socialisation but enterprise tools are based on 1950s management thinking that treats us like machines in a production line the focus of information sharing in support of decision making should be on weaving the social web and allowing people to negotiate their own language and meaning by adding social markup to existing corporate data
174524 the first time around knowledge management was hardly a smashing success when organizations several years ago tried to take advantage of the experience and insights of their workers they captured information in large structured data systems for access and retrieval unfortunately those systems were often cumbersome and difficult to use leading to low levels of participation and abandoned knowledge bases workers also suspected their own positions might be at risk after they shared their personal insights and knowledge
174525 change happens too fast for people and organizations to rely exclusively on structured processes and the rigid it solutions that support them
174526 understanding about the role of knowledge in empowering people rigid structured systems for data capture can easily be supplemented with more user friendly applications that provide better integration into day to day work
174527 it is virtually impossible to design a process that anticipates every potential outcome a dke embraces people as part of structured processes and enables them to access the resources they need in a more flexible and responsive way when people are empowered as a part of process driven work organizations can achieve the economy of structure combined with the responsiveness and adaptability that only people can provide
174528 most of the successful km applications were workflow aligned and when km was a separate document repository outside of business processes it was much less successful then it became
174529 earlier post about knowledge and information the insightful comment and i would like to share it here she alludes to the impossible act of managing knowledge and instead says the aim is to
174530 youre in the middle of the mojave desert you come upon a gas station but its abandoned lying on the counter is a map most would consider the map information data in context but theres another criteria it isnt information until its in individually relevant context it has to be both important and understandable to me in the middle of the desert there is no context the map is useless noise
174531 i know where you are going paula km is integrated into how you work in the future there may not be km as its just how we work km is simply common sense a way of being why would you work any other way the net generation would not have a clue they are knowledge workers they are just being
174532 this stuff that organically emerges or manifests tells them something about themselves they are learning from their interactions by participating they can take back these rich insights and apply this new thinking in their doing as you put it
174533 social tools are humanistic as they are about conversation and connection thats how we get work done in the offine world
174534 i can see we need information managers but im not sure about knowledge managers rather we need people that are more humanistic learning type facilitators
174535 but we do need someone to make sure that all these knowledge sharing activities and way of being are occuring this person will be managing knowledge related activities not knowledge itself
174536 the goal is not to manage knowledge but to facilitate action or enhance thinking
174537 even more fundamental to the deeper philosophy here is that knowledge is relevant it can only reasonably be applied to specific conditions few knowledge management technologies embrace the reailty and ensure that the relevant conditions are captured and likewise communicated
174538 provided with the right tools and a culture that values openness knowledge gets transferred effectively without management
174539 i think it fairly self evident that a large number of business goals require knowledge to be managed in some form or other
174540 debates raged about the best ways to move back and forth between the codified explicit knowledge and the less obvious often invisible tacit knowledge that surfaces in human interaction and how best to enable or enhance the collaborative and interactive use of information and knowledge to get things done or create additional useful knowledge
174541 knowledge transfer is self assembling and self organizing it really cant be otherwise it is
174542 the idea that we must make knowledge workers unusually altruistic to get them to share and transfer knowledge ignores the many examples of social systems and organizations in which collaboration is based on normal motivations including self interest
174543 we need to think more carefully about combining top down design and direction of business processes with the bottom up use of knowledge objects the combination of structure and organic generation and synthesis can help manage effectively in continuous flows of incoming and outgoing information knowledge objects are anything that we can coherently manage
174544 an appropriate amount of structure design constraints is necessary to enable consistent recall and findability of information
174545 i do think we need a new word for what is often understood as
174546 km can exist without the technology the technology offers a platform for pervasiveness and ease of implementation but without management drive cultural capability localised or across the organisation and openness youre doomed tech or no tech
174547 i am still at a loss as to what is uniquely km and to what purpose it serves that is not already served by established disciplines
174548 anything 2 0 is not about the technology technology is and always has been an enabler
174549 organisations feel they need a km practice because they dont actually do the things that embed km practices into corporate dna
174550 km only needs a revolution where km is implemented as a widget
174551 km is not about tools it is about how we understand what is important in value creation
174552 that exactly where the shift is from documentation to conversation
174553 with this shift there is another shift happening we change both our conception of knowledge management and knowledge itself we now concentrate on knowledge sharing and we understand knowledge differently
174554 when it comes to defining knowledge one can distinguishes three dialectics explicit vs tacit ontological vs contextual and private vs public the first one is based on the physical status of knowledge the second one on its epistemological status and the third one on its economical status
174555 in the km era explicit ontological private understanding prevails that is the reason why there are many processes explicitation data ontology and egoist knowledge is power behaviors this later is the reason why km fails
174556 we try to work on present knowledge not past knowledge we try to materialize conversations knowledge on the go ecm focuses on the result a document enterprise 2 0 tools focus on the journey between the idea generation and idea formalization in between what you have there is individual and collective work reflexion and conversation enterprise 2 0 tools capture at the very same time they enable conversations and in a much more efficient way than emails distributed by nature as centralized in one place a blog a wiki you now have knowledge management on the go
174557 while km was regarded as a specific job with a specific team who has specific expertise it is now dispersed throughout the organization as embedded in operational processes there is no km anymore because it is just everywhere
174558 but what happens now with knowledge sharing is not often the responsibility of the km team
174559 they dont have to deal with data and documents they have to deal with people

174861 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all
174862 i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ died in vain
174863 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of this world and not after christ
174864 there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death

174870 and in the sixth month the angel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgins name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast her mind in what manner salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man she had not slept with a man she was a virgin and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the most highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god

174881 greater is he god that is in you than he the devil that is in the world
174882 but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed

175129 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
175130 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who who could have been a good australian citizen

175148 while these activities continue and with this threat to my life i have to sit in a place which is known to him and his friends and prepare my defence

175152 this result is a clear rejection of an inadequate offer our members are clear that they cannot afford another series of below inflation pay increases
175153 inflation is at 4 6 and key items on household bills like bread and milk are increasing even faster our members need a fair offer from their employers we have a window of opportunity to see if we can avoid disruptive strikes i hope the employers take it

175174 oklahoma city is known for bricktown so call the team the brickmasons and if theyre really bad they could be the bricklayers
175175 thats obviously the first step in brett coming back so well deal with that when he is reinstated and well definitely have a plan in order
175176 he is an asset to our football team once again im going to answer this question for the last time the plan for brett favre will be discussed with brett favre first and then well make it aware to the public
175177 hell be starting all of the games as the starter
175178 weve talked about possibly playing our first group maybe a little longer and those are things that well discuss the health of your football team obviously factors into that so that is our plan going into the preseason with aaron
175179 you know im not as affected as you guys the media think i am or should be
175180 they told me im the starter and until that changes thats going to be my focus
175181 ive been empowered as the starting quarterback and until that changes ill say it again thats going to be my focus
175182 who knows how brett feels about that if hes coming in as being the backup or coming in and a potential trade is going to happen i dont know
175183 but if he comes in as the backup he just comes in and plays the way he knows how to play and if its better then the organization has another decision to make
175184 theres no reason for anyone in the locker room to take sides or say in the media they prefer one guy over the other
175185 its job and at this point its his job to keep
175186 we have talked about it as a football team the players are handling it totally different than i think the perception is out there were about playing football were about getting ready for our season upcoming everybody is aware of everything that is going on there are no ill feelings toward brett favre and he will be welcomed back into our locker room
175187 he would look ugly in any other uniform plain and simple

175197 its true that olmert was enthusiastic about the peace process and he spoke about this process with great attention but it has not achieved any progress or breakthrough
175198 the palestinian authority deals with the prime minister of israel regardless if he is olmert or somebody else
175199 i continue to believe wholeheartedly that reaching peace ending terrorism strengthening security and establishing a different relationship with our neighbors are the most vital goals for the future of the state of israel

175227 op de website staat ook dat ouders altijd contact moeten opnemen met de school van de kinderen voor de data van de vakantie
175228 het is dan ook niet geheel onlogisch dat er juist in deze periode klachten van studenten zijn
175229 daar hebben we ook de selectie op toegespitst er zijn alleen mensen aangenomen die zeggen zeker te weten voor de klas te willen staan
175230 in een zaal met driehonderd studenten hebben we eens gevraagd hoeveel mensen naar deze nieuwe lerarenopleiding zouden gaan als die bestond de helft stak zijn hand op
175231 gelukkig hebben we door de zomervakantie wat respijt om vervangende lokalen te regelen
175232 de wetgever heeft verzuimd deze bevoegdheid in de wet op te nemen
175233 een collega wilde zelf een getallenlijn maken maar ik had het idee dat daar toch iets over op internet te vinden moest zijn die informatie vond ik via kennisnet bij de community 3 4 dat bleek nog gratis te zijn ook super want een getallenlijn met losse cijfers is volgens ons nergens te koop uit reacties op de community blijkt dat meerdere leerkrachten tegen dit probleem aanlopen het is fantastisch om te zien hoe inventief men is in het vinden van een oplossing en hoe bereid deze leerkrachten zijn om die met hun collegas te delen
175234 iedereen geeft elkaar tips dat vond ik heel leuk om te zien
175235 het is heel makkelijk om te inventariseren of anderen al vergelijkbare projecten hebben ontplooid zodat we daarvan kunnen leren als school zijn we bovendien druk bezig om de kansen van digitaal leermateriaal te onderzoeken en daarover is veel informatie bij de communitys te vinden ik ben overigens verbaasd dat ik het 100 000e lid blijk te zijn stomverbaasd maar vooral blij verrast dat zoveel mensen zich hebben aangemeld toont aan dat leerkrachten elkaar graag willen helpen heel bijzonder

175246 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
175247 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
175248 the mccain campaign was compelled to respond to this outrageous attack because we will not allow john mccain to be smeared by senator obama as a racist for offering legitimate criticism
175249 we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it incur with president clinton

175258 he was just so excited to be going on the trip i shook his hand and said have a good time and take care you dont think those words are going to haunt you
175259 he was a lovely kid a happy go lucky kid he was well respected and he had everything in front of him
175260 they left a club they were walking down the road and four guys pulled up in a car they were big guys and presented themselves as police
175261 they were told to get up against the wall cameron said this isnt good they are not police and when they went to go they started bashing them
175262 he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time
175263 put it this way our parents brought us up very well he had been with all my cousins he loved it so much he thought about not leaving malta to go to greece he wanted to stay there and talked about how much he liked it
175264 they cried when they were leaving one of the cousins said to him i dont want you to go
175265 he was the most beautiful down to earth humble person
175266 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of the most iconic brands of the 20th century
175267 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
175268 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
175269 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
175270 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
175271 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made

175290 this is focused on supporting the host city it was to support denver and our home community
175291 the reason this loophole was not closed when the federal election commission considered it in 2003 was that the political parties that dominated the commission wanted the loophole to continue to support what is the biggest campaign ad of the election
175292 it was even expanded to include businesses that had no local connection whatsoever to the host city
175293 its just the level we thought would be appropriate to be a good corporate citizen in our hometown
175294 the donation was not because it was the democrats it was because it was in denver
175295 sponsoring the denver host committee gives us a great platform to demonstrate our commitment to the city and its small business community as well as to showcase our environmental initiatives

175491 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
175492 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
175493 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
175494 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
175495 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it

175502 clements warnung vor dem energiepolitischen abenteuer des kandidatenduos ypsilanti scheer in hessen lieferte endlich den vorwand daf r auch ihn mundtot zu machen sollte das ausschlussverfahren gegen ihn rechtskr ftig werden k nnte becks spd bald nicht nur am linken sondern auch an ihrem rechten rand anh nger verlieren
175503 wenn wir jeden der bei uns mal bl dsinn erz hlt oder uns probleme macht ausschlie en dann wirds auf dauer einsam
175504 formalrechtlich geht es um drei fragen verstie clement gegen einen grundsatz der spd tat er es mit vorsatz und war es parteisch digend er hat ohne zweifel den grundastz der solidarit t verletzt erkennbar mit vorsatz er hat in einem namensbeitrag f r eine zeitung dazu aufgerufen ypsilanti nicht zu w hlen dagegen begehrten 13 ortsvereine unterbezirke auf die das verfahren gegen ihn in gang gebracht hatten aber umstritten ist die dritte frage nach dem politischen schaden
175505 nrz jetzt wird es wieder hei en die spd die sowieso schlecht zurecht ist bt sich in blutiger selbstzerfleischung wars das wert malzahn h ren sie mal wir wollten es bei einer r ge belassen wolfgang clement war es der einen freispruch wollte jetzt hat er das ergebnis bekommen nrz alles in allem ein guter tag f r die sozialdemokraten malzahn ja wir wollen die partei erneuern ein erster schritt ist getan

175536 john mccain wasnt really a prisoner of war he was off having a good time in north vietnam all those years
175537 but mccain only got where he is because his dad was a navy admiral hell he was a playboy in the military academy
175538 yeh but barack wont say the pledge of allegiance or put his hand on his heart or even wear a lapel flag pin now that takes the cake
175539 if you think thats bad mccain was among the us congressmen who were called the keating five and investigated because they were taking money from charles keating of the 1989 savings and loan scandal that cost us taxpayers more than 3 billion and that was a gob of money back then
175540 hell thats nothing i dont trust anyone who comes from chicago and besides barack is a young whipper snapper that preacher rev wright that he had was a black racist
175541 come off it mccain is a womanizer when he got back from vietnam in no time he divorced his crippled wife and married himself a rich young blond who later got hooked on prescription drugs
175542 but mccains wife doesnt call us whites whitey and cindy mccain has always been proud of her country unlike michelle
175543 yeh but have you heard about the other woman in mccains life some lobbyist vicki his aides back in 2000 had to keep the two apart
175544 get off it lots of guys have affairs look at clinton and now john edwards two lousy democrats but if you look in any mans closet long enough youre going to find an affair or two obama just isnt old enough yet and thats part of his problem he has no experience in administration
175545 so does mccain hell he doesnt even know how to do email yet besides mccain tells nasty jokes like asking why chelsea clinton was so ugly because he dad was really janet reno now lets get a guy in there with some class
175546 you call a former student of a madrassa moslem school classy you know if obama gets elected hes going to swear on the koran and paint the white house black
175547 cmon youre full of you know what at least obama can control his temper i hear that when the red phone rings during mccains nap his face will get redder and hell tell his generals to bomb the hell out of whoever woke him

175590 wayne was interviewed by police in connection with an alleged minor offence involving a paparazzi photographer who had been persistently invading his and coleens privacy throughout the evening
175591 this included the photographer following the couple into a restaurant from which he had to be evicted
175592 wayne was happy to cooperate fully and to give a clear version of the events in which he believes he was blameless
175593 we received a third party allegation at 12 09am on wednesday that a photographer had been spat at by an individual outside a restaurant in hanway street
175594 officers established the incident had occurred at around 10 20pm on tuesday
175595 the alleged suspect a 22 year old male was spoken to by police
175596 he was not arrested and did not attend a police station inquiries continue

175605 he stepped up and did a tremendous job here to hold the fort down while we were going through our stuff with jorgie
175606 there were things i was not comfortable with its a sellers market if you want to meet the sales price then obviously you can get a deal but i wasnt willing to do that

175614 the current low liquidity is making it hard to be fully confident about the sustainability of the rebound seen wednesday
175615 we still hope there will one day be an agreement for the americans to stop subsidies to their cotton farmers so african cotton can compete on the world market
175616 most of the key issues of interest to the african continent were not even discussed especially the issue of cotton
175617 africa critically needs to realise development and get itself out of poverty through the establishment of fair trade rather than aid africas opportunity to achieve fair trade has therefore been gravely undermined by the lack of progress in these negotiations
175618 we are happy we will keep the status quo this gives us breathing space
175619 the failure of the geneva negotiations is obviously not good news for us in the cdc because we depend on wto mechanisms that provide protection for vulnerable sectors like banana production
175620 one of the key causes of the current food crisis namely market distortions brought about by the subsidies will remain to haunt us
175621 it is wrong for people on their own to do what they think is right and expect everybody to be all right and abide by it
175622 but what we have realised is that they come and pay and dont comply with the directives therefore creating a lot of troubles for everybody
175623 the auditor general shall audit the public accounts within six months at the end of each financial year and shall submit its report to parliament
175624 take steps to eradicate corrupt practices and the abuse of power
175625 if therefore for three years the report has not been discussed or debated how can we fight corruption
175626 we need an urgent response to the situation since people will not be able to use vehicles on the route this is beyond the community
175627 such moves can divide the communities and are sources of conflict
175628 it is time for members of the party to resist such dictatorial tendencies
175629 the constituency executive committee shall be responsible for overseeing the operations of the party within the constituency and the implementation of its programmes for promoting social and political awareness and general political education within the constituency it will also be responsible for recruiting members into the party and for mobilising support for the party before and during elections
175630 we are therefore appealing to the national and regional executive members of the party the campaign team and the leader nana akufo addo to as a matter of urgency do whatever they can to call the nsc to order to ensure tranquillity in the constituency
175631 the zimbabwe dollar will be redenominated by a factor of one to 10 which means we are removing ten zeros from our monetary value ten billion zimbabwean dollars today will be reduced to one dollar with effective from august 1

175633 it is unfortunate that our region which lags behind in terms of npp votes is rather delaying whereas all other regions have their teams in place and working hard towards victory

175724 senate vote gives bush what he wants on surveillance bill
175725 as has been their hallmark this congress bush mccain republicans have once again run away from an important debate failing to back up their words with action
175726 it is this kind of misplaced priorities that is making america less secure
175727 the commission has adopted a set of principles that protects consumers access to the internet we found that comcasts actions in this instance violated our principles
175728 this fight is not over we intend to challenge this bill as soon as president bush signs it into law
175729 the bill allows the warrantless and dragnet surveillance of americans international telephone and email communications it plainly violates the fourth amendment
175730 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
175731 thanks to the internet we have more readers for our great journalism than at any time in our history but also thanks to the internet our advertisers have more choices and we have less money
175732 gi meg de rene og ranke de faste og sterke menn
175733 it has been years since i have spent a day without pain pain is more than the chemical signal of an anguished nerve ending when processed by the brain it becomes an emotion enhanced and flavored by its meaning in a larger sense as it portends change disappointment and death that emotion has filled my days
175734 2661 237 seconds but for me its easier just to convert it to digital if you are slack you could just hold it for 10 seconds or you could tuffen up a bit your call you know your own life better than i do
175735 i said a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop a you dont stop the rock following the massive old school anniversary hip hop tour in march and the upcoming
175736 we meet danny and hes about to have an operation everything thats happened between 1969 and 2005 is in his body
175737 its in his arm legs back kidneys all the horrific incidents and hes going to get the truth cut out of him and all those horrible incidents
175738 hes visited by ghosts of the dead hes possessed by them manifestations of people killed in the conflicts during that time
175739 in afghanistan they have adapted it to their own circumstances they have taleban members ordinary citizens russian soldiers all represented by ghosts in the play
175740 there were various conversations by e mail about how it would be adapted and if it would be useful
175741 i signed the rights to a production for afghanistan and theyve done it in dari and pashtu two of the biggest language groups in afghanistan and theyre running it all over
175742 but when is the right time for this when like in afghanistan the conflict is still ongoing
175743 if they were to wait for the conflict to be over they would be waiting a long time
175744 it could be argued a bit like the irish conflict that war and a peace process often go hand in hand
175745 everyone was mentally affected everyone has been left traumatised and depressed

175751 now this has been standing here for centuries the premier work of man perhaps in the whole western world and its without a signature chartres a celebration to gods glory and to the dignity of man all thats left most artists seem to feel these days is man naked poor forked radish there arent any celebrations ours the scientists keep telling us is a universe which is disposable you know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things this rich stone forest this epic chant this gaiety this grand choiring shout of affirmation which we choose when all our cities are dust to stand intact to mark where we have been to testify to what we had it in us to accomplish our works in stone in paint in print are spared some of them for a few decades or a millennium or two but everything must finaly fall in war or wear away into the ultimate and universal ash the triumphs and the frauds the treasures and the fakes a fact of life were going to die be of good heart cry the dead artists out of the living past our songs will all be silenced but what of it go on singing maybe a mans name doesnt matter all that much

175755 today thursday july 31 we shot a video nah more like a short film really for the first featured track from death magnetic directed by fellow dane filmmaker thomas vinterberg we spent the better part of the afternoon playing the day that never comes to a sold out crowd of dust and smoke just outside of los angeles ca should be ready to share with all of you at the end of the month give or take more to come
175756 now that gas prices are high theres another reason to look at two wheel transportation
175757 concern about energy prices has brought customers in who are probably on the peripheral about motorcycles
175758 there is quite literally a desire for simple transportation as opposed to riders weve had who have bought bikes primarily for recreation
175759 if you pull up on a scooter everyone smiles its one way we can adjust and still have a lot of fun
175760 in a general motorcycle environment out of 200 motorcycles i sell two customers may ride day in and day out in short of ice and snow on the road
175761 although slowing economies in the u s and europe and inflation fears in asia will undoubtedly slow earnings momentum these could also provide attractive opportunities for capital deployment
175762 we had a weak upper level disturbance over north texas the last couple of days and its still in our neighborhood
175763 the summer moisture and afternoon heating were producing thundershowers overnight
175764 normally we see storms develop west to east but these developed east to west
175765 winds in upper level atmosphere are pretty week so we have storms floating around up there
175766 it hind of made a loop and came back into our neighborhood

175772 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president of the united states or mr universe
175773 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day

175775 somebody get a f ing corn dog in his hand now

175778 on several occasions and is currently using nicorette gum with success
175779 i mean really who quits smoking and doesnt gain any weight
175780 they are not there to be fondled kissed or felt they are there to be admired discussed lusted after and photographed the moment they are touched and i mean in the heat of passion rather than out of curiosity or in the interests of scientific research then the spell is broken and this is true of all fake breasts no matter how much money has been spent on this act of female self mutilation
175781 hardbody blonde trophy girlfriends in the eighties was a fiction and remains so
175782 why arent there armies of thinking women protesting about the grotesquely booming trade in bogus breasts
175783 breast surgery has become just another part of the beauty regime like applying make up and its unnecessary and unpleasant
175784 its treated the same as getting a haircut its become normalised i think any woman considering breast surgery for cosmetic reasons should spend a month in darfur and then decide if body image is a really important issue
175785 fake breasts have become inescapable but i think the main reason why women do it is to please men theyre trying to fulfil a male fantasy and i dont think we can blame them for this it might make them feel more confident but it is ultimately for men
175786 fake breasts simply look false they lack any kind of beauty or the softness associated with real breasts implants look like two oranges stuffed in your top theyre nothing like real breasts
175787 three were cosmetic and two were reconstructive one of the cosmetic operations went wrong and the implant leaked so she had to have two reconstructive operations after that
175788 a lot of them were very scarred from all the surgery
175789 there was one lady in particular whose boobs didnt even look like boobs any more
175790 very few of my patients are the glamour model types we see in the media
175791 i tell them to go to somebody else if they say they want to be like jordan
175792 big implants cause drooping over time they stretch the skin and squash the breast tissue women whove had them will definitely need more operations over time which will in turn cause more scarring

175833 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
175834 the international media continued that media witch hunt so that is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardises the trial itself
175835 lake bluff requested financial records thursday from a resident who got an 80 000 property tax break from the illinois department of revenue after he converted his lakefront mansion into a church
175836 honestly i was thinking whoa if i can make it out of here this is going to make a good story
175837 some of the people in burundi dont like the president and they thought he was in the car
175838 they were looking at us and it wasnt like hey i want to shake your hand we came to find out later that theres been like six attempts on the presidents life
175839 that was a moment i waited until i got home to tell my wife about
175840 you have to take like 800 shots and burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world and theyre going through a civil war right now so there was just a lot of uncertainty
175841 it just gives you a perspective on life i went over there expecting to see people down and out in poverty they were in poverty but they werent down and out they were full of joy
175842 its a trip that sparked a lot of great things in me

175844 we had suits on thinking we were going to this really nice building and we pull into a field and you just see avocado plants and youre like what are we doing
175845 then we saw the president in a jumpsuit like a mechanic would wear and hes got a blade and a hoe and hes just going at it all of the sudden and im not even kidding you we were surrounded by about 12 000 people

175884 everyone feels like theyre in on this very very cool wonderful thing that the general public doesnt know about it makes them feel like insiders and who doesnt want to feel that way
175885 these fans immerse themselves in the story and it is that immersion that makes them different
175886 these shows really speak to people on a deeper level
175887 and once you have utilized all there is on the dvds and youre still excited about the show you want more
175888 said erin ferries vice president of licensing for creation entertainment of burbank whose tv related fan conventions and merchandise pull in sales of 6 million a year
175889 but desperate housewives and greys anatomy are more general mainstream type shows and they draw a more mainstream audience my mom loves greys anatomy but she certainly is not going to get on a plane and fly somewhere to sit in a ballroom for two or three days so she can meet the stars of the show
175890 they are very clued in to things that are new they are early adopters and they are computer literate and computer savvy
175891 firefly was an incredibly well written well thought out show
175892 were hoping that some bright person in hollywood will realize that there are a lot of us out there who are really drawn to this and give us more we want the rest of the stories
175893 you have to have talent that wants to participate and some of these smaller shows that fly under the radar lend themselves to that
175894 you have people who are more willing to do anything they can to gain more exposure for their shows
175895 fans are the best and only chance for promotion that we have theyre the best thing that weve got going so wed be foolish to turn our backs on them
175896 there have been several instances where individuals who have been invited to a meeting have forwarded the meeting invitation to other individuals even though this is an option that is available in outlook it is not advisable for several reasons it is considered poor meeting etiquette to invite other people to a meeting who are not on the original guest list

175901 a subversion of the classic fairy tale motif with a female prince which is then subverted
175902 does anyone else think this type of portrayal of women is wrong its one of the few things that makes me really angry i hate it when people try to make women equal by showing them beating up men this model is basing a persons self worth on their physical ability in real life it is nearly impossible for a little skinny woman to beat up a man creating a fantasy world in which women are equal because they can beat up men is only reinforcing the fact that this is nothing like real life
175903 woman strong when she can kick ass amp take names

175905 as a politically minded parent i am conscious to try and discuss what we watch with ethan during and after we watch it see what he thinks and reinforce our pro feminist anti racist anti consumerist values

175909 t he idea of unilateral sanctions theyre effective only to a certain extent and therefore other countries must also join and frankly theres some countries in the neighborhood that arent interested in joining
175910 the us is certainly doing the most for the opposition there has been real success in training and forming an underground movement through religious organisations and monastic organisations these provide the best cover inside burma the monks can spread their training very effectively

175962 the study demonstrates that our tight junction technology effectively delivers pyy into the body via nasal administration but that the peptide itself is not effective as a single agent for weight loss
175963 we are pleased that once again our delivery technology has effectively and safely delivered a large molecule via the intranasal route with good tolerability but disappointed that pyy did not show more promising therapeutic effect we believe our intranasal delivery technology continues to demonstrate value as a means of safely administering peptides and proteins and believe that pyy might still prove effective in combination with other weight loss drugs we would like to thank the investigators staff and patients who participated in the trial

176016 those who got the vaccine happened to be healthier not because the flu vaccine was protecting them from pneumonia caused by the flu since it wasnt present yet
176017 so for several years now we have had large studies which question the benefit of influenza vaccination the notion that flu shots are so important thus seems more the result of repeated assertion than the weight of solid scientific evidence
176018 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
176019 such a taboo is irresponsible and definitely not serving the publics best interest

176050 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
176051 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
176052 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics

176057 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
176058 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company

176063 are like those who eat cherries first picking the best ones and winding up by eating everything
176064 it is a strange thing to come home while yet on the journey you cannot at all realize how strange it will be
176065 remember that happiness is a way of travel not a destination
176066 clay lies still but bloods a rover breaths aware that will not keep up lad when the journeys over therell be time enough to sleep
176067 as the traveler who has once been from home is wiser than he who has never left his own doorstep so a knowledge of one other culture should sharpen our ability to scrutinize more steadily to appreciate more lovingly our own
176068 too often i would hear men boast of the miles covered that day rarely of what they had seen
176069 stop worrying about the potholes in the road and celebrate the journey
176070 one main factor in the upward trend of animal life has been the power of wandering
176071 the open road is a beckoning a strangeness a place where a man can lose himself
176072 travel only with thy equals or thy betters if there are none travel alone
176073 our deeds still travel with us from afar and what we have been makes us what we are
176074 an involuntary return to the point of departure is without doubt the most disturbing of all journeys
176075 once in a while it really hits people that they dont have to experience the world in the way they have been told to
176076 half the fun of the travel is the aesthetic of lostness
176077 i should like to spend the whole of my life in traveling abroad if i could anywhere borrow another life to spend afterwards at home
176078 as the traveler who has once been from home is wiser than he who has never left his own doorstep so a knowledge of one other culture should sharpen our ability to scrutinize more steadily to appreciate more lovingly our own
176079 dont tell me how educated you are tell me how much you traveled
176080 when one realizes that his life is worthless he either commits suicide or travels
176081 without new experiences something inside of us sleeps the sleeper must awaken
176082 arriving at each new city the traveler finds again a past of his that he did now know he had the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign unpossessed places
176083 he who has seen one cathedral ten times has seen something he who has seen ten cathedrals once has seen but little and he who has spent half an hour in each of a hundred cathedrals has seen nothing at all
176084 a journey of a thousand miles begins with a cash advance
176085 travel at its truest is thus an ironic experience and the best travelers seem to be those able to hold two or three inconsistent ideas in their minds at the same time or able to regard themselves as at once serious persons and clowns
176086 most of my treasured memories of travel are recollections of sitting
176087 i am not the same having seen the moon shine on the other side of the world
176088 only by going alone in silence without baggage can one truly get into the heart of the wilderness all other travel is mere dust and hotels and baggage and chatter
176089 when youre traveling ask the traveler for advice not someone whose lameness keeps him in one place
176090 to be on a quest is nothing more or less than to become an asker of questions
176091 the traveler sees what he sees the tourist sees what he has come to see
176092 when you are everywhere you are nowhere when you are somewhere you are everywhere
176093 when preparing to travel lay out all your clothes and all your money then take half the clothes and twice the money
176094 the autumn leaves are falling like rain although my neighbors are all barbarians and you you are a thousand miles away there are always two cups at my table
176095 it is not down in any map true places never are
176096 we are all travelers in the wilderness of this world and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend

176453 in some cases they just couldnt get the crop planted at all
176454 whats out there looks pretty good right now were not going to have a great year like we had last year when we had record yields across the board but this year is going to be an average to above average
176455 was looking a little shaky to begin with but now its coming on strong they are looking at a potentially good year overall the crops in both states will probably be down about 900 000 bales from last year together the states will have about 1 1 million bales compared to 2 million bales this time a year ago
176456 dont carry the significance they once did planting is down in the southeast about 17 percent and in the mid south about 30 percent meaning about 366 000 acres fewer will be harvested in the southeast and 800 000 acres fewer in the mid south
176457 based on conditions of the crop were looking at a drop of 2 million bales from last year when both regions combined produced about 8 5 million bales
176458 the arkansas crop still looks like it will break 1 000 pounds per acre mississippi has been a bit dry and that crop has been reduced tennessee and missouri have both had good weather and theyre looking at 900 pounds per acre
176459 the average yields last year of 843 pounds across the state are phenomenal compared to 10 years ago the weather was ideal and only 200 000 acres were abandoned texas growers also have a sizable 1 ton club growers who produce 4 bales per acre of lint on at least 20 acres
176460 however because of dry planting conditions high winds blowing sand hail and extremely hot temperatures at planting time im estimating that 900 000 acres to 1 million acres of the 4 7 million acres planted have been abandoned
176461 about half of the remaining 3 7 million acres is irrigated and has a high yield potential roughly we have about 300 000 acres in texas under drip irrigation and have the possibility of making 3 bales per acre
176462 has shown for the past month that one third of the texas crop is in poor or very condition one third fair and one third good to excellent
176463 because of dry weather cotton is stressed in south texas the coastal bend and the blacklands hurricane dolly came in on the south texas end and probably lowered the yield and quality down there somewhat on about 100 000 acres
176464 we think yields in these areas of texas will be way below average
176465 after carefully considering recent crop reports weather conditions the price trends received in the grain markets and likelihood of increasing land for crop production weve decided not to allow the penalty free release of crp land at this time
176466 despite the damage and disruption caused by the very severe floods that hit the midwest last month indications so far are that the impact on this years corn and soybean crops will be less than what was originally feared
176467 reacted favorably to the good growing weather weve been experiencing in recent weeks and encouraging reports on crop conditions cash prices for corn are down 25 percent and down 14 percent for soybeans from their record highs just last month
176468 on track to be the second largest on record with an anticipated harvest of nearly 79 million acres
176469 easing of prices and will allow current crp contract holders to make informed decisions about whether to make an early exit from the program
176470 the 34 7 million acres now enrolled in the program will have to shrink
176471 looking out over the next few years 1 1 million crp acres are scheduled to expire this sept 30 that number jumps to 3 8 million acres on sept 30 2009 in 2010 another 4 4 million acres will
176472 so large blocks of land will be available for other uses if landowners choose to pursue them owners also have the option of taking their acres out of the program in exchange for returning all payments theyve received plus interest and a penalty some are doing so now
176473 so where this option makes economic sense to contract holders theyre clearly willing to use it
176474 this spring in april and may we saw crp withdrawals peak in april just over 34 000 acres paid their way out of crp in may almost 37 000 acres did the same over the 19 month period the average per month exiting crp by buy out was just over 15 000 acres

176573 so good has the lowdown on anything thats happening in the world of food media hes the guy who broke the lebron james papa johns scandal and the hilarious kraft cheese myspace debacle

176580 a new blog from funny as hell stand up comedian jon eick
176581 taking products designed for large companies and then retrofitting them to work for smaller businesses is a recipe for failure it would be like a bus manufacturer changing the color of the bus from yellow to black and then calling it a car

176598 this surprising excess of many types of chromosomal changes in schizophrenia patients provides us with rich clues to follow up in future research
176599 this work opens up an entirely new way to think about schizophrenia and eventually will suggest new avenues for researching effective therapies for the sake of patients and families suffering from this terrible disorder
176600 the consortium should be recognized for taking the important first step towards unearthing the full underlying genomic architecture of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders
176601 only by doing such a large study could we have uncovered these stunning findings to such a high degree of confidence thus setting the stage for an even more complete understanding of the full genomic contributions to disease this study could only have been done with the open collaboration of many individuals and institutions dedicated to understanding and treating this terrifying disease
176602 by implicating two previously unknown sites this study triples the number of genomic areas definitely linked to schizophrenia it also confirms in a large sample that unraveling the secrets of rare structural genetic variation may hold promise for improved diagnosis treatment and prevention of such neurodevelopmental disorders
176603 the specific way a small overall increase in this kind of genetic variation translates into schizophrenia for a given patient is not yet known especially given the common occurrence of these structural genomic variations in everyone

176616 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
176617 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
176618 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups

176629 allah taala granted the renowned scholar shaykh abul hassan ali nadwi rahamtullahi alayh such acceptance that once during the period of hajj the imam of the haram shaykh khayyat quoted the name of shaykh abul hassan and a teaching from one of his books during the friday khutbah the great shaykh upon hearing this began to shed tears of gratitude to allah seeing his reaction the people around him asked him after the salaah who shaykh abul hassan was as they felt that he must be very close to him however such was his humility that those around him did not even realise that he was the very shaykh whom the imam had just quoted with such reverence and honour

176644 repensando el siglo xix desde am rica latina y francia
176645 hay al menos tres conceptos o ideas importantes en la denominaci n del coloquio repensar el siglo xix desde am rica latina y francia que estamos organizando en mendoza la primera es la palabra repensar si decimos repensar es indudable que hay antes un pensamiento que debemos pensar de nuevo en este caso pensar lo que estaba pensado en el siglo xix pero desde el siglo xxi
176646 actualmente la idea es que al contrario podemos volver a leer el siglo xix pasar por el xx para
176647 porque implica un di logo una integraci n una reformulaci n que puede ser muy interesante para ambas partes
176648 podemos interrogarnos sobre los modelos tradicionales en los que se ha hecho referencia a las categor as de
176649 desde mi punto de vista hay una interrogaci n sobre qu es la colonizaci n qu es la idea de poscolonialismo hay temas sobre la visi n que podemos tener como testimonio sobre la inmigraci n sobre la naturalizaci n podemos revisitar estos temas pero tambi n podemos ver desde la ptica de los franceses y realizar una interrogaci n desde nosotros por ejemplo interrogarnos sobre la figura de la revoluci n francesa el mito los conceptos a trav s de los cuales pensamos la pol tica este es justamente el trabajo conjunto que se puede realizar entre latinoamericanos argentinos y franceses de una manera u otra m s sistem ticamente es un trabajo que permite una reflexi n conjunta por ello la circunstancia del coloquio es muy buena porque participar la comunidad universitaria estudiantes y profesores entre los cuales hay una relaci n cada vez m s fuerte creo que es el momento de reflexionar en com n sobre estas cuestiones

176654 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her
176655 last weekend dave had just about had enough of his neighbor for one lifetime so he figures hes going to do something about it he gets up at about four a m and goes to the kitchen for a jar of skippy out he creeps onto her lawn and leaves a big dollop of peanut butter on the grass then goes back to bed
176656 at his usual time dave takes belle out for a walk and deliberately cuts across his neighbors lawn which brings her out on the front porch shouting at him that his dog left another mess in her yard
176657 dave says the neighbor hasnt so much as looked at him since

176679 the fishing business is no longer sustainable and many of my friends feel frustrated i am thinking about selling some of my assets to diversify my options i am beginning to fail to provide some essential needs for my family
176680 this has been brought about by carelessness of both the communities and governments along the lake we dont know how long it will go on because we have talked to everybody who could listen but the authorities are more interested in development
176681 but information indicates that only 10 percent of the sewage gets treated
176682 we have many players licensed to go fishing by local governments to mitigate this we are planning to again centralise licensing because local governments are more interested in the revenue not conservation
176683 we were earning over 150 million from fish exports in the past years but i dont think that we shall even earn 90 million this year
176684 anybody attracted by the huge demand available on the market can get his boat and line up his gear to start fishing
176685 this has created a lot of pressure on the lake and the fishing gear used is not the best to allow the resource to renew
176686 we also plan to promote the use of fishing gear that allows the fish to grow as mostly young fish are being caught currently
176687 the flower factories are all located along the lake in all three countries and they use a lot of chemicals that end up in the lake
176688 over 75 percent of the wetlands have been significantly affected by human activities and 13 percent are severely degraded
176689 population growth around the continents largest lake is significantly higher than the rest of africa

176691 from the preliminary results cyanobacteria like anabaena were found in the water samples these can be very toxic for plants and animals including humans because of the toxin microcystin
176692 they can accumulate in the fish tissues liver intestines and gallbladder which means that secondary contamination by eating toxic fish from an infected pond or lake is possible

176707 he turned himself in and confessed to murdering his sister to cleanse his family amp squo s honour because she disappeared from home for four months with a man
176708 our information is he was shot at 12 noon 7pm sydney time

176710 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
176711 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
176712 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who who could have been a good australian citizen
176713 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we would have been a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
176714 and if we wouldnt have sent him away he may well be alive and well amongst us at the moment
176715 we were targeting the sport but we were trying to widen the database
176716 and theres one way you do it you fly in and you fly out but we werent after that market we wanted to lengthen the stay beyond three days because on the long hauls it is just not going to happen
176717 so even though were targeting the race as the main feature the actual organization of the holiday isnt
176718 it takes the focus off the racing to do other things its more about a destination than just a race
176719 to fly for at least 12 hours just for a weekend is not going to convince most clientele
176720 by the time you go there and back its a day or a day and a half with the time difference so to encourage people to go and see a race there have to be more elements that we have to offer
176721 its basically theres more to a race than high speed cars
176722 we analyzed our business potential for the malaysian grand prix and there were a lot of females involved in the decision making process
176723 if you targeted the ladies youd get a lot more people going we said to the ladies why dont you spend three days doing what you want to do going to the beach getting a tan doing the bar all that kind of stuff and then doing the male thing of the race weekend it worked
176724 for a race weekend in europe you could put it up by 50 to 70 and literally do five nights in southeast asia

176728 whether it was the right decision or wrong decision it is a decision i made
176729 im not going to think about what other people think about me all im going to think about is how im going to shoot a better score tomorrow and how im going to shoot a low number and i think a low number will take care of everything

176744 i saw the ad and wondered wtf what does brittney spears have to do with presidential politics the ad seemed petulant as if the candidate were complaining that it was unfair that obama was more popular than mccain
176745 im sorry but theres just no other way to put it mccains campaign is still foundering sinking slowly beneath the waves as the good ship obamas wake continues to slosh over the gunnwales on its way by
176746 besides being paranoid the idea that mccains genuinely weak celeb ad draws from triumph of the will is remarkable for something else its implicit contempt for modern germans it is not much better than the pro war german bashing that took place during 2002 03 when war supporters frequently complained that the germans had lost their former enthusiasm for conflict both treat germans in an essentialist way and try to reduce them to the most cartoonish stereotypes as if a cheering throng of germans in berlin c 2008 must necessarily conjure up associations with nazi rallies
176747 ill stop writing about how john mccain is embarrassing himself when he stops embarrassing himself
176748 his latest most personal assault on barack obama is further proof that the so called maverick has trashed his own promise of high minded discourse and instead embraced the gut kicking bush political template of the past eight years indeed you dont have to be an obama fan to conclude that the latest assault is juvenile i say this because a fair number of republicans some speaking anonymously to the press with others including former mccain aides speaking on the record have already judged the assault to be juvenile or as ex mccain intimate john weaver prefers to call it childish
176749 you can make obama into britney spears or john kerry or malcolm x im not sure you can make him into all three at the same time is there a template in american culture for an ivy league snob black militant out of control former mouseketeer sure there is some overlap between one aspect of one attack and another but overall its a scattershot way of attacking
176750 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie

176757 pete is a fine lad that needs to sort himself out this is mister rotten telling you i waltz on stage sober because no drug in the world is as good as being absolutely 100 percent honest with your audience nothing compares to that emotion
176758 i love all kinds of music but the one thing i have never done is imitate black music in her idiotic way theres not a single word that means anything
176759 i dont like pale imitations and shades of things and i am always wary when people go jazzy because jazz is the best cover up for a lack of talent the world has ever known
176760 and the cover up for her which is probably the guilt trip is that she requires vast amounts of drugs to hide the fact that she is fake
176761 i was talking to one of his ex girlfriends not too long ago and she was texting him the whole way back from edmonton until 10 minutes before this accident happens
176762 he was just sitting there texting her listening to music on his cellphone
176763 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
176764 my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up
176765 i was completely shocked cuz tim has never been a roughhousing guy
176766 hes always been a quiet guy just kind of socialized with his buddies and that was it
176767 from what i hear this other guy is three times his size
176768 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
176769 it was like he was at the beach or something there was no rage in him he wasnt swearing or cursing or anything it was just like he was a robot or something
176770 while we were waiting on the side of the road the attacker was taunting the police with the head in his hand
176771 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history
176772 i can assure people that everything is in full motion and momentum to getting to the bottom of this incident
176773 he didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
176774 in perfect overleg met de belgische bond zal fellaini toestemming krijgen om na de partij tegen brazili terug te keren naar luik

176779 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
176780 not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena not give interviews and not even publish literary works in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
176781 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic just as long as i left pale
176782 it is clear that unable to fulfil the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
176783 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
176784 holbrookes wish for my disappearance is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
176785 while these activities continue and with this threat to my life i have to sit in a place which is known to him and his friends and prepare my defence
176786 i was in danger of being liquidated because i had made a commitment
176787 i cannot imagine that his defence would be anything but a political one
176788 the family has always said they have evidence of proof of the secret agreement
176789 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations

176823 most of the players id say about 99 9 per cent want to go to the olympics this is a big big big deal
176824 guys want to go but theyre just being held back by their clubs theyre important for their clubs and you can understand it but i think its a great rule that they have to be released
176825 the olympics is an opportunity to be on the world stage its a huge event and everyone wants to be a part of it
176826 i can understand why the clubs want to do everything to keep their players but for the players i just think its a great tournament to be a part of
176827 i know a lot of younger players had problems with their clubs about going to the olympics but my club ajax didnt make any problems
176828 i didnt have any problems they understood that it was very important for me to play in this tournament
176829 for me this is a great competition and to let young players play is a great move from fifa

176831 lower costs are not always the only factor that make overseas drug companies prefer india to conduct their clinical trials it is equally important for them to reduce the timelines since india has large patient groups who are drug na ve the patient recruitment process for trials becomes quicker if you can cut back the enrollment time by one month that itself can be of great benefit the shorter the time the less the expense

176840 het is algemeen bekend dat ik nog wat goed te maken heb op de spelen
176841 whether its modeling clay dolls or crayons a small number of people can be counted on to use it for something vulgar
176842 user created content gives players total control over their game experience and empowers them to express their creativity in ways that they never thought possible
176843 it also gives them a powerful emotional connection to the game since theyve created the world from scratch
176844 the characters can engage in some of which include sexually graphic acts
176845 i admit it is silly and juvenile but i dont think theres anything perverted vile or awful about it if people find it offensive they can simply not search for it online no one is forcing anyone to see this content
176846 i consider this very similar to child pornography at least to the extent of distributing the material to children
176847 my initial reaction to discovering it in my final game would be to ban it so it wouldnt show up again and then blow it to pieces for the sheer satisfaction of it
176848 go ahead create a walking phallus see how long it lasts in the databases and galaxies of spore

176850 pilates can help to build and maintain posture as the bodys center of gravity changes promote long elegant posture and graceful flowing movement and keep you centered and energized all at the same time
176851 i find that many people are successful losing weight with pilates because they become much more aware of their bodies and in turn treat them better and make better food choices
176852 simply stated pilates is strength training we work with resistance to increase strength and hence muscle mass using springs and different apparatus to increase the load to the muscles we can affect a metabolic increase by building lean muscle mass
176853 i enjoy adding light weights to my pilates routine because it provides variety and challenges muscles in a different way

176862 they just found the first three skinheads and brought them to the court without any real evidence
176863 i think if you did a survey of 100 people and asked them if they wanted the ban lifted almost all of them would say no
176864 its true they did spend a lot of cash in bars and restaurants but i think the owners of these establishments are just happy to have a quiet life without the added hassle or threat of violence hanging over them
176865 the base itself does contribute to the employment market because locals take jobs there but on an individual basis the soldiers arent really seen as contributing anything positive
176866 from time to time we have incidents but these are normal fights that happen all over the world to suggest there is a bad relationship creates a negative picture that does not reflect reality
176867 the ban is a matter for the army it has nothing to do with cypriots

176873 there are times however and this is one of them when even being right feels wrong what do you say for instance about a generation that has been taught that rain is poison and sex is death if making love might be fatal and if a cool spring breeze on any summer afternoon can turn a crystal blue lake into a puddle of black poison right in front of your eyes there is not much left except tv and relentless masturbation its a strange world some people get rich and others eat shit and die

176920 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america

176922 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
176923 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
176924 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
176925 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
176926 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
176927 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
176928 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
176929 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
176930 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai

176932 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom
176933 we can now concentrate on finding out who is responsible for this it is completely unacceptable

176938 we should constantly be reviewing our policies constantly be looking at those sanctions to make sure that they are directed toward that purpose that purpose is every bit as important now as it was ten years ago when we began it and frankly they have worked he saddam hussein has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction
176939 everybody ive spoken to understands that this guy saddam hussein and his regime and his activities present a danger to the region not a danger to the united states
176940 there can be no doubt that saddam hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more
176941 my colleagues every statement i make today is backed up by sources solid sources these are not assertions what we are giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence
176942 there were some people in the intelligence community who knew at that time that some of these sources were not good and shouldnt be relied upon and they didnt speak up that devastated me
176943 i think it didnt even constitute an imminent threat to its neighbors at the time we went to war
176944 i tried to avoid this war i took him bush through the consequences of going into an arab country and becoming the occupiers
176945 biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more many more
176946 as scientific evidence grows to corroborate the theory that human activity is a catalyst fueling global climate change it becomes increasingly difficult to take serious arguments put forward to refute the facts it is to our societies collective detriment however that there are powerful coalitions of political and economic forces at work that persist in the effort to discredit status quo nowhere are these factions more influential or pervasive than in north america general electric routinely minimize the significance of environmental issues in order to deter public participation in the political process political activism is the greatest source of potential opposition to corporate activity that is responsible for the creation of excessive and unnecessary environmental degradation impugning the credibility of individual activists in order to discredit the message they convey is a typical approach in trying to undermine the environmental movement unfortunately al gore provides an abundance of ammunition for his detractors to use in discrediting his sincerity and by inference the credibility of his message earth in the balance ecology and the human spirit
176947 we must make the rescue of the environment the central organizing principle for civilization
176948 i have become very impatient with my own tendency to put a finger to the political winds and proceed cautiously e very time i pause to consider whether i have gone too far out on limb i look at the new facts that continue to pour in from around the world and conclude that i have not gone far enough t he time has long since come to take more political risks and endure more political criticism by proposing tougher more effective solutions and fighting for their enactments
176949 the very idea of putting wti in a flood plain you know its just unbelievable to me
176950 a clinton gore administration is going to give you an environmental presidency to deal with these problems well be on your side for a change instead of the side of the garbage generators

176953 signing the protocol while an important step forward imposes no obligations on the united states the protocol becomes binding only with the advice and consent of the us senate
176954 as we have said before we will not submit the protocol for ratification without the meaningful participation of key developing countries in efforts to address climate change
176955 we need to promote the stable flow of investment around the world
176956 the temptation for journalists is to blame it on personal moral failure clinton and gore are hypocrites liars the old story if only we could find a morally pure politician everything would be okay the reality is less glib and more disturbing every american politician has to pay for their massive election campaigns and there is one group waiting with open wallets and a few polite requests the fossil fuel industry democrat or republican if you dont lick the boots of the oil and gas companies you never get the key to the white house this legalised bribery is often so naked that many corporations give to both parties to ensure whoever wins is in their debt anybody with environmental leanings is quickly tamed 28 gas and oil companies gave to al gores election campaign from bp amoco to enron from exxon to chevron occidental petroleum paid for the clinton gore inauguration and stumped up an extra pounds 50 000 after gore personally made a begging call to their ceo these companies own the american political process and they are violently opposed to any moves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions they can keep us politicians on a short leash since presidents and senators are forced to spend around half their time fundraising according to bob woodward clinton was so exasperated by this corporate cash treadmill he once snapped we spend so much time raising money when do we get to govern some politicians deal with this double bind by rote learning an ideology neoliberalism that says there is no conflict between the public welfare and corporate welfare as eisenhowers secretary of defence charles wilson put it whats good for general motors is good for america al gore is far too smart to fall for this but he was powerless to act when clinton arrived in the white house in 1992 gore lobbied him hard for the only environmentally sane solution a broad based energy tax that would hit the dirtiest fuel coal hardest and have a knock on effect on natural gas and petrol clinton agreed with a nervous nod in the direction of his campaign contributors but it was impossible to get it past a democratic congress also drenched in petrol yet in al gores inspirational lectures on the danger we face there is only the most fleeting of references to the special interests that want us to ignore global warming and silence about gores own dependence on them why doesnt gore mention this the biggest brake on dealing with global warming because if he wants to run for president in 2008 he will have to plunge back into the petrol tank to grab some campaign funds he cannot afford to alienate potential donors so he cannot give a full and honest account of the problem
176957 in praise of slow how a worldwide movement is challenging the cult of speed
176958 we cannot afford to wait another 15 years to clean it up

176968 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
176969 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
176970 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
176971 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
176972 who are open to doing something on the production side
176973 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
176974 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
176975 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
176976 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
176977 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
176978 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
176979 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
176980 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
176981 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
176982 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
176983 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
176984 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
176985 he has no place to train his al qaeda killers anymore and if we excuse me for a minute and if we find a training camp well take care of it either we will or our friends will thats one of the things part of the new phase thats becoming apparent to the american people is that were working closely with other governments to deny sanctuary or training or a place to hide or a place to raise money
176986 osama bin laden is not in pakistan if anyone has the information he should give it to us so that we can apprehend him
176987 to disarm iraq of weapons of mass destruction to end saddam husseins support for terrorism and to free the iraqi people
176988 i dont know where he is i ill repeat what i said i truly am not that concerned about him
176989 a me in montagna mi prende la voglia di andare al mare
176990 mi dispiace gentile orpello io voler sempre al di sopra di te tocca la sedia con la punta delle dita e nulla mi impedir di farlo dopo una pausa forse neanche esisti perch dovrei preoccuparmi di te
176991 ohil compagno come va la preparazione del tuo dessert per il pranzo di gala della rivoluzione
176992 non ti stufi mai di essere la pantomima di te stesso
176993 non devi sfogarti con me se sei arrabbiato senza motivo la mia rabbia ha un motivo ed ha uno sfogo come diresti tu la tua esistenziale e forse anche esistentiva lo snob contrae le labbra in una smorfia ah ah ma com che non ti vedo mai ridere
176994 non hai nemmeno la minima idea di cosa significhino le parole che proferisci e pretendi di giudicare me
176995 ma certo continua pure a trincerarti dietro ai tuoi pensieri non credi che la vita non sia da guardare ma da prendere in mano sale sulla sedia calpestando la manica del pastrano noi camminiamo come un eroe verso la vittoria come un eroe verso la vittoria
176996 dai ho pure cercato di farti piacere citando un tuo amico almeno riconoscimelo
176997 ma si pu sapere coshai una volta almeno ci tenevi ad insultarmi
176998 finalmente al completo rivolto al m sempre in ritardo eh
176999 vedo nei tuoi occhi lo spavento della novit sembri uscito da un vecchio dagherrotipo
177000 lo sai che condivido con te pi di quanto non faccia con quel falstaff l in fondo ma sai anche che tra noi c un abisso incolmabile ed quellabisso che ora sento
177001 ma un nonsense pi della vita ma cosa vuol dire non c nulla pi della vita pi del fare pi della possibilit
177002 in fondo come la pioggia e forse prima delle labbra nacque il sussurro
177003 ma tu non vorrai sul serio farmi credere che tutto ci serio vero
177004 voi siete matti matti non potete capire se non volete
177005 la vita bella lo diceva anche il tuo amico leone
177006 leone eh alle volte forse una mela una mela praghese vale pi si blocca guarda verso la luce e comincia rimettersi il cappotto gi una mela si avvia verso le quinte continuando a lanciare sguardi verso la sedia e di sottecchi alla platea adieu
177007 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
177008 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
177009 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
177010 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
177011 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
177012 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
177013 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
177014 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
177015 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
177016 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
177017 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
177018 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
177019 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
177020 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
177021 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
177022 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
177023 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
177024 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
177025 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
177026 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
177027 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
177028 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
177029 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
177030 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
177031 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
177032 more often than not the obama campaign is discussed as the home team
177033 i dont think its such a bad thing if for 15 minutes you take off your reporter hat and respond to obama as a human being at an event where youre surrounded by people of color and youre here for a united cause
177034 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
177035 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation
177036 the nations news organizations continue to generate dismal diversity numbers year after year ten by 2010 is a significant step in the right direction
177037 so before i die ive got to try those things that for years i had ignored
177038 i want what she is having only add some more whipped cream
177039 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
177040 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
177041 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
177042 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
177043 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
177044 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
177045 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
177046 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
177047 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
177048 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
177049 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
177050 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
177051 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
177052 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
177053 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
177054 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
177055 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
177056 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
177057 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
177058 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
177059 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
177060 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
177061 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
177062 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
177063 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
177064 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
177065 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
177066 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
177067 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
177068 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
177069 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
177070 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
177071 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
177072 we are proud that our dominator memory once again hit a new world record

177079 august 14 2006 the executive director of human rights watch found that the sudanese government is both incapable and unwilling to protect its own citizens in darfur and that its militias are guilty of crimes against humanity
177080 all parties to the conflagration committed serious abuses including widespread killing of civilians rape as a tool of war systematic torture robbery and recruitment of child soldiers both government forces and militias allied with the government are known not only to attack civilians in darfur but also humanitarian workers sympathizers of rebel groups are arbitrarily detained as are foreign journalists human rights defenders student activists and displaced people in and around khartoum some of whom face torture the rebel groups have also been accused in a report issued by the american government of attacking humanitarian workers and of killing innocent civilians
177081 im not sure what you suggest a viable alternative would be at this point or what this alternative might mean to afghani women
177082 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
177083 this would give us another opportunity to go after it
177084 i would hope that we would have an opportunity to show them other venues that would possibly work we never got to that stage before
177085 our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime
177086 or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii and korea we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
177087 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
177088 the expansion of private i e mainly corporate power and the selective abdication of governmental responsibility for the well being of the citizenry
177089 the privatization of public services and functions manifests the steady evolution of corporate power into a political form into an integral even dominant partner with the state it marks the transformation of american politics and its political culture from a system in which democratic practices and values were if not defining at least major contributory elements to one where the remaining democratic elements of the state and its populist programs are being systematically dismantled
177090 the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
177091 neither the doctrine of separation of powers nor the need for confidentiality of high level communications without more can sustain an absolute unqualified presidential privilege of immunity from judicial or congressional process under all circumstances

177264 the israeli enemys increase in violations of lebanese airspace water and land especially in the past few days is considered an unacceptable provocative escalation
177265 it requires condemnation and serious action by the lebanese authorities and the united nations
177266 there has been a sharp increase in israeli breaches of lebanese airspace water and land this month
177267 the success of hizbullah in the negotiations led by a third party is a national success for the party and for the struggle of the lebanese because it secured national goals which israel always refused to respect

177320 we are an easter people and alleluia is our song
177321 the hypothesis which seems to me the most fertile is that the news and truth are not the same thing and must be clearly distinguished
177322 distraught man that no one could understand or reason with
177323 was pounding on the windows behind us he was throwing chairs at one point he grabs some computer equipment off the desk here at the airport threw that to the ground
177324 when the man appeared poised to throw something at them one of the officers pulled out his taser
177325 the man fell to the ground uh yet still continued to be combative and fight
177326 police say moments after they handcuffed the man he stopped breathing and was pronounced dead at the scene
177327 rcmp in vancouver say they had no choice but to use a taser today on a yet unknown but clearly agitated man
177328 was sweating profusely he had tipped over his luggage cart uh he was pounding on windows he grabbed a uh computer off of one of the uh workstations and thrown it to the ground
177329 while he was shouting in an eastern european language the rcmp say they dont know where he was coming from only that he had just arrived after repeatedly ignoring their calls for him to calm down the decision was made to use the taser even after the man in his forties was struck with 50 000 volts of electricity he continued to struggle then just four minutes after he was placed in handcuffs he wasnt moving at all
177330 we were told that the security personnel had a man who was throwing chairs around pamphlets around yelling screaming taking his fists and pounding on the glass
177331 there were no choke holds placed there were no punches thrown they were just trying to get him to settle down they were able to place handcuffs on the individual and uh during that course as theyre still trying to get him to calm down the man slipped into unconsciousness
177332 the mounties say pepper spray wasnt ideal because the area was crowded with travelers and suggest that the baton may have been too violent
177333 there was only one officer trained to use the taser and that was the one who used it
177334 he speaks russian and nobody can help him we need a russian interpreter here to calm him down
177335 why arent police officers here you guys came you got the police
177336 after repeatedly ignoring their calls for him to calm down the decision was made to use the taser even after the man in his forties was struck with 50 000 volts of electricity he continued to struggle
177337 were just trying to get him to settle down they were able to place handcuffs on the individual and uh during that course as theyre still trying to get him to calm down the man slipped into unconsciousness
177338 distraught man that no one could understand or reason with
177339 yelling screaming taking his fists and pounding on the glass
177340 the mounties say pepper spray wasnt ideal because the area was crowded with travelers and suggest that the baton may have been too violent
177341 the primary responsibility of a peace officer is to preserve and protect life
177342 the primary objective of any use of force is to ensure public safety
177343 we believe this terminology has inadvertently created a mindset among users and the public that these weapons can never have lethal effects an expectation that is clearly unrealistic throughout this document and in our supporting material we have used the term lower lethality which more accurately conveys the notion that death may be associated to the use of these technologies
177344 where individuals are contained in a room officers should use the time to formulate a plan for entry and restraint that allows them to immediately turn the person over to ambulance personnel
177345 there was only one officer trained to use the taser and that was the one who used it
177346 we know that the rcmp are reviewing the use of the taser and this must be done because of unfortunate accidents and i want to carry the sympathy of our party to the family
177347 theyre doing work that doesnt require them to be in front line duties
177348 closely monitoring rcmp progress as it relates to the investigations underway so that i can ensure at their completion a timely response to this complaint
177349 that growing misperceptions are eroding the publics confidence in the rcmp
177350 the rcmp recognizes the video images recently made public are disturbing for anyone who sees them we do not however believe that it is appropriate to draw conclusions based on these images alone
177351 there were no surprises in the coroners inquest to us what we heard we already knew
177352 so you knew that sheremettas story about what happened would be contradicted by five other witnesses
177353 yes we did and we presented that exact investigation to the crown
177354 again i repeat its been my experience and certainly the experience of major crime investigators that when you have witnesses who recollect an event its always a little different
177355 i found as a matter of fact ian bush was behind and on top of officer koester that officer koester took his gun struck him three times in the head to force him to release and he wasnt released
177356 a horrible tragedy that both koester and the bush family will have to live with for the rest of their lives
177357 that is not unreasonable its expected in a crime scene investigation

177367 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
177368 i am extremely resistant to the notion that we are going to adjourn the beginning of the trial
177369 it is regrettable that mr saduloev did not sign until last friday he did sign he did not die and then become resurrected and die again he is alive and well but for whatever reasons for reasons we say of his travel and difficulty with communication and him just being too busy to look at it too preoccupied it was not signed until friday july 25
177370 we intend that mr saduloev will give evidence in person at the trial i cannot give an absolute 100 per cent guarantee that that will happen but that is the intention and your lordship has already made observations in relation to there being no permission for evidence by video link at this stage anyway
177371 if he does not turn up then his evidence will fall away

177376 andrei is ready to move to tottenham now it just depends on zenit
177377 they are the one team that fully agreed on his contract demands and are ready to pay almost the full price that zenit wants
177378 spurs had the money for andrei all the time and their interest isnt new zenit doesnt want to say that they have official offer from tottenham but they have it

177381 when ralph goodale tried to tax income trusts dont forget dont forget this they showed us where they stood they showed us about their attitudes towards raiding seniors hard earned assets and a conservative government will never allow either of these parties to get away with that
177382 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal
177383 it is difficult for us to take a decision but arsenal is certainly something that gokhan needs to look at
177384 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement

177390 watching in horror as their investments and trust in alberta falter
177391 the perception that albertans are getting ripped off by big oil despite the governments continuing budget surpluses fuelled by oil activity
177392 threatened to move 1 billion worth of spending from alberta next year if the full scope of the recommendations is adopted
177393 slash spending by 800 million next year if the recommendations are fully adopted
177394 if the panels proposals are adopted many oil and natural gas activities in alberta would be rendered uneconomic canadian natural would have no choice but to reduce activity and via our contractors would result in an estimated 3 900 less direct jobs and 16 000 less indirect jobs for albertans
177395 if the royalty panels recommendations are adopted in full we would have no choice but to slow down our alberta based activity and move investments to other areas in canada and the u s that are more economically attractive
177396 crude oil lived up to its reputation as black gold once again in september the oil price rose 13 percent taking it to new record levels while the natural gas price rose 14 percent
177397 generated a record 3 1 billion dollars in the first half of 2007
177398 second quarter cash flow and operating earnings are significantly higher than one year ago production is on track to meet our full year targets and capital costs are tracking below budget at mid year our sustainable low risk business model is delivering on our expectations and we are well positioned to create strong long term performance
177399 if the proposed recommendations are adopted encana plans to cut its 2008 capital investment in alberta by about 1 billion or 30 to 40 percent of the 2 5 billion to 3 billion the company has planned for alberta based activity most of the reductions would be to encanas natural gas activity in areas where the proposed royalty scheme makes those activities uneconomic or uncompetitive in its portfolio the company plans to reallocate capital to investments outside alberta
177400 we care deeply about the impacts the royalty review panels recommendations if adopted in full would have on the communities where we operate and on the alberta economy we agree that changes to the royalty structure are needed just not in the way the review panel has proposed we want to work with the alberta government to find a solution one that works for all albertans one that strengthens albertas future

177415 the citys road network the majority of which was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s is in need of major repair and rehabilitation the citys water and wastewater network is similarly aged 50 per cent of the water pipes and 30 per cent of wastewater pipes are more than 50 years old while seven per cent of water mains and three per cent of wastewater infrastructure are more than 100 years old due to fiscal constraints the citys current spending in the capital program is less than ideal insufficient funding to the state of good repair for all programs has created backlogs worth hundreds of millions of dollars in addition capital requirements resulting from population growth and demographic changes further exacerbate capital under funding

177425 hollywood believes large scale broadband video distribution would only destroy proven value fail to provide alternative value and alter a business model that is still far from being in decline with near total control of the most valuable program libraries and the business models governing their distribution a shift towards broadband media will come largely on hollywoods terms and at an incremental pace
177426 although 180solutions has come to realize that third party distribution can be hard to police we believe it is possible to properly balance who we do business with while providing monetization methods for the long tail of web publishers and content developers
177427 the advertisers benefit by repeat display of the name of their products google benefits because it does gets paid for the occasional click the cost is my inventory of space not googles so every click is gravy to google and every exposure is value to the advertiser in effect google is giving away exposures on my blog so that they can sell a few clicks which they will dutifully pay me for
177428 when i came to this slide during my presentation in san jose i asked the audience how many were familiar with the long tail concept practically no one was yesterday the same thing happened with my chicago audience of about 300 people maybe 10 percent of the hands went up when i asked how many knew about the long tail
177429 as the data indicates recommendation tools can provide important stimuli for increasing the diversity of music from genres to artists to which consumers are exposed recommendation tools can be a crucial component in driving demand for back catalogs as a source of high margin revenue for rights holders as well as toward niche artists and music that they otherwise would
177430 on november 13 2005 google announced google analytics a free web analytics service targeted at the long tail of small and medium size businesses that lack a web analytics solution
177431 the real issue for the studios is how they can dig into this potential gold mine without undermining their existing revenue streams
177432 la times on the end of the mass moviegoing era
177433 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
177434 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues
177435 bollywood tv says it has the internet rights to more than 730 indian films though at any one time on its site i have not seen more than 100 movies
177436 1 every dollar coming out of print advertising revenue for newspapers is replaced by only 33 cents online 2 the largest 50 web companies are attracting 96 of the ad spending on line according to pricewaterhouse coopers with the majority going to aol google msn and yahoo
177437 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
177438 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings
177439 search engines have the effect of counteracting the skewed distribution of links in the web directing some traffic toward sites that users would never visit otherwise
177440 lets say that joss whedon creator of firefly wanted to bring the series back to air
177441 the big companies have mostly finished their erp and crm implementations which is why oracle has been on a buying binge the action today is in small and medium sized businesses smbs from a service producers point of view how can we service smbs profitably on fairly short engagements with 1 or a few consultants and from the smbs point of view how can they add the it talent that they dont have in house in the short small doses when they need it
177442 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
177443 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it
177444 indie films are typically made before they have u s distribution and with independent financing therefore the producer does not know when if ever the film will be released in theaters so unlike studio films independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign or used to recruit merchandising tie ins independent producers therefore have only a singular product the movie itself to find a distributor they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival at that point if the film is to succeed it must create its own audience through reviews awards and word of mouth so while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule an independent producer must keep re editing a film no matter how long it takes until the film works perfectly as a result independent films win much of the glory and awards and studio films win most of the gold taking in well over 80 percent of the box office proceeds
177445 at a time when audiences are ebbing piracy is threatening profits and at home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie going equation a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable dvd players or reserved seats it may also be as close to a no risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared and a master to be copied and unlike traditional or even online distribution deals the filmmakers retain all the rights
177446 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges
177447 the majority of revenue in search is still made in popular searches rather than the tail in fact over 70 of search revenue is made on just 30 of the searches this shows both the stiff competition that exists for popular keywords and the upside that still exists for paid search as that competition spreads to the tail
177448 three weeks ago sheffields arctic monkeys entered the uk charts at number one with their second single i bet you look good on the dancefloor they had just played their second london gig before an audience of 3 000 even by the hyper speed standards of modern rock and pop this was a remarkable rise apparently made possible only because the band had posted their songs on their website and thus built up a vast virtual fanbase before even securing a record deal

177450 but within their niche they dominate a site that ranks as number 100 000 in the overall web universe would still be the fifth largest within its niche big enough to throw some weight around furthermore niches have their own niches focusing on a highly targeted subtopic can make even a tiny site with a few hundred thousand page views stand out
177451 the business is made much more complex by windows and audiences that are fragmenting
177452 the story for the next 10 years is how content is going to adapt you wont find your audience in any one place anymore
177453 allow people to buy stuff the way they want to so that you can wring every last cent out of your content by earning 1 from someone who isnt willing to spend 10 for the entire book perhaps someone will shortly suggest a subscription model for online books sign up for a membership plan and get to read as many books as you want or a specified monthly quota on your computer but without being able to download or print the books probably too easily hackable but much more appealing to me because it means having a potentially huge number of books available for actual reading on your desktop without even having to trudge down to the library
177454 the executives at dmg still seem to be in the process of choosing a business model last year the company said it planned to beef up hiring so it could sign promote and market undiscovered artists in may it abruptly shifted gears laying off seven of its 15 workers and decided to focus on buying the rights of golden oldies also in the second quarter the company took a 75 000 writedown for a non recoverable advance it made to an unnamed recording artist
177455 in 1976 punk broke onto the music scene and changed the rules of music music was democratized you didnt even need to be able to sing or know how to play music you just needed a guitar now blogging is having the same impact on publishing of course a lot of rubbish gets produced but some great gems get created too that wouldnt have normally been produced under the old system this is the era of punk publishing look around the blogosphere can you spot the sex pistols or the clash can you see a great entrepreneur like the one we got from that era richard branson
177456 the obscure articles edited by a few authors that know about the subject are honestly some of the best in wikipedia i think as long as they are not about anything controversial usually they arent though or they would have more editors
177457 i am wallowing in composers and works that i had never heard of svendsen vieuxtemps pitfield grieg other than the great piano concerto
177458 the xbox which focuses on highly mature genres catering to hardcore gamers has production costs of 1 82 million a title the gamecube costs half as much at 822 000 a title the real kicker is that the nintendo ds only costs 338 286 a title to develop for even less than the gameboy some of these costs have to do with the hardware and development kits but for the most part they are derived from the scope of the projects being able to develop successful titles at 1 5th the cost of your competitors is a major boost to your bottom line
177459 a great analogy to describe the potential impact of the long tail in book search is to consider the rapid rise of consumer created content online including blogs message boards ratings sites and other forms of social media these platforms are becoming incredibly influential not just because of their sheer popularity and compelling content but because they represent a massively growing share of online content relative to all other such as corporate commercial editorial and government content these more niche social media tend to place very prominently in search engines and therefore can achieve otherwise disproportionate exposure anyone responsible for the reputation of a big corporate brand is often kept up at night by that fact the little guys voice is being heard like never before loud and clear

177467 why is there such a long tail of programming languages in the community and is there an efficient way to satisfy the obvious need for more niche languages and promote the language innovation that happens in the long tail the first question is pretty easy to answer there is a long tail because the more specialized a language is to a domain the better it fits to solve problems for that domain these niche languages trade off generality for efficiency in a domain and they are simply better and more efficient tools for that domain the second question is a bit harder
177468 bridging the digital divide is all about serving the longest tail by driving down price and driving up access and interoperability what is happening in massachusetts is the beginning of a global realization that governments have a productive obligation to serve the longest tail their citizenry by deploying open accessible standards not the technology of a single company

177477 new communication technologies and the lowered cost of participation they created allowed the linux movement to effectively harness a large and diverse wealth of programming power that would otherwise have been unavailable to it
177478 a true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches where there are just one or even zero customers you need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers so what businesses fit this model the obvious one is ebay omidyars model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you dont find a buyer ebay takes a small listing fee but works better if you do ebay takes a percentage another example is cafepress they dont even set a listing fee working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them they aggregate sales and pay monthly

177481 as in other domains this move towards distributed creation and production is being driven by more affordable and accessible tools of production the backwoods meth producer is a direct descendant of the backwoods hootch producer during the prohibition we may not like what they are producing but history has shown they will be quite creative in finding ways to produce it themselves the mit fab lab participant the remix dj at the local hip nightclub the extreme sports enthusiast and the backwoods meth producer all share a common passion producing goods and experiences on their own terms

177519 the real issue for the studios is how they can dig into this potential gold mine without undermining their existing revenue streams
177520 la times on the end of the mass moviegoing era
177521 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
177522 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues
177523 bollywood tv says it has the internet rights to more than 730 indian films though at any one time on its site i have not seen more than 100 movies
177524 1 every dollar coming out of print advertising revenue for newspapers is replaced by only 33 cents online 2 the largest 50 web companies are attracting 96 of the ad spending on line according to pricewaterhouse coopers with the majority going to aol google msn and yahoo
177525 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
177526 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings
177527 search engines have the effect of counteracting the skewed distribution of links in the web directing some traffic toward sites that users would never visit otherwise
177528 lets say that joss whedon creator of firefly wanted to bring the series back to air
177529 the big companies have mostly finished their erp and crm implementations which is why oracle has been on a buying binge the action today is in small and medium sized businesses smbs from a service producers point of view how can we service smbs profitably on fairly short engagements with 1 or a few consultants and from the smbs point of view how can they add the it talent that they dont have in house in the short small doses when they need it
177530 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
177531 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it
177532 indie films are typically made before they have u s distribution and with independent financing therefore the producer does not know when if ever the film will be released in theaters so unlike studio films independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign or used to recruit merchandising tie ins independent producers therefore have only a singular product the movie itself to find a distributor they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival at that point if the film is to succeed it must create its own audience through reviews awards and word of mouth so while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule an independent producer must keep re editing a film no matter how long it takes until the film works perfectly as a result independent films win much of the glory and awards and studio films win most of the gold taking in well over 80 percent of the box office proceeds
177533 at a time when audiences are ebbing piracy is threatening profits and at home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie going equation a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable dvd players or reserved seats it may also be as close to a no risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared and a master to be copied and unlike traditional or even online distribution deals the filmmakers retain all the rights
177534 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges
177535 the majority of revenue in search is still made in popular searches rather than the tail in fact over 70 of search revenue is made on just 30 of the searches this shows both the stiff competition that exists for popular keywords and the upside that still exists for paid search as that competition spreads to the tail
177536 three weeks ago sheffields arctic monkeys entered the uk charts at number one with their second single i bet you look good on the dancefloor they had just played their second london gig before an audience of 3 000 even by the hyper speed standards of modern rock and pop this was a remarkable rise apparently made possible only because the band had posted their songs on their website and thus built up a vast virtual fanbase before even securing a record deal

177541 allow people to buy stuff the way they want to so that you can wring every last cent out of your content by earning 1 from someone who isnt willing to spend 10 for the entire book perhaps someone will shortly suggest a subscription model for online books sign up for a membership plan and get to read as many books as you want or a specified monthly quota on your computer but without being able to download or print the books probably too easily hackable but much more appealing to me because it means having a potentially huge number of books available for actual reading on your desktop without even having to trudge down to the library
177542 the executives at dmg still seem to be in the process of choosing a business model last year the company said it planned to beef up hiring so it could sign promote and market undiscovered artists in may it abruptly shifted gears laying off seven of its 15 workers and decided to focus on buying the rights of golden oldies also in the second quarter the company took a 75 000 writedown for a non recoverable advance it made to an unnamed recording artist
177543 in 1976 punk broke onto the music scene and changed the rules of music music was democratized you didnt even need to be able to sing or know how to play music you just needed a guitar now blogging is having the same impact on publishing of course a lot of rubbish gets produced but some great gems get created too that wouldnt have normally been produced under the old system this is the era of punk publishing look around the blogosphere can you spot the sex pistols or the clash can you see a great entrepreneur like the one we got from that era richard branson

177546 the xbox which focuses on highly mature genres catering to hardcore gamers has production costs of 1 82 million a title the gamecube costs half as much at 822 000 a title the real kicker is that the nintendo ds only costs 338 286 a title to develop for even less than the gameboy some of these costs have to do with the hardware and development kits but for the most part they are derived from the scope of the projects being able to develop successful titles at 1 5th the cost of your competitors is a major boost to your bottom line
177547 a great analogy to describe the potential impact of the long tail in book search is to consider the rapid rise of consumer created content online including blogs message boards ratings sites and other forms of social media these platforms are becoming incredibly influential not just because of their sheer popularity and compelling content but because they represent a massively growing share of online content relative to all other such as corporate commercial editorial and government content these more niche social media tend to place very prominently in search engines and therefore can achieve otherwise disproportionate exposure anyone responsible for the reputation of a big corporate brand is often kept up at night by that fact the little guys voice is being heard like never before loud and clear

177555 why is there such a long tail of programming languages in the community and is there an efficient way to satisfy the obvious need for more niche languages and promote the language innovation that happens in the long tail the first question is pretty easy to answer there is a long tail because the more specialized a language is to a domain the better it fits to solve problems for that domain these niche languages trade off generality for efficiency in a domain and they are simply better and more efficient tools for that domain the second question is a bit harder

177566 a true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches where there are just one or even zero customers you need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers so what businesses fit this model the obvious one is ebay omidyars model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you dont find a buyer ebay takes a small listing fee but works better if you do ebay takes a percentage another example is cafepress they dont even set a listing fee working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them they aggregate sales and pay monthly

177569 as in other domains this move towards distributed creation and production is being driven by more affordable and accessible tools of production the backwoods meth producer is a direct descendant of the backwoods hootch producer during the prohibition we may not like what they are producing but history has shown they will be quite creative in finding ways to produce it themselves the mit fab lab participant the remix dj at the local hip nightclub the extreme sports enthusiast and the backwoods meth producer all share a common passion producing goods and experiences on their own terms

177752 urban theorist jane jacobs observed many years ago that paradoxically huge cities create environments where small niches can flourish a store selling nothing but buttons most likely wont be able to find a market in a town of 50 000 people but in new york city theres an entire button store district subcultures thrive in big cities for this reason as well if you have idiosyncratic tastes youre much more likely to find someone who shares those tastes in a city of 9 million people

177762 now you have paid online radio and free online radio paid online video and free online video at first the paid stuff is good and the free stuff is less good but soon producers seeking an audience start to make their stuff free because when they do the audience goes up 100x and then in order to compete others do the same thing wouldnt you if you had a touring band wouldnt you if you had already exhausted your dvd sales and wanted a big enough audience for your sequel

177786 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
177787 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues

177790 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
177791 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings

177795 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
177796 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it
177797 indie films are typically made before they have u s distribution and with independent financing therefore the producer does not know when if ever the film will be released in theaters so unlike studio films independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign or used to recruit merchandising tie ins independent producers therefore have only a singular product the movie itself to find a distributor they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival at that point if the film is to succeed it must create its own audience through reviews awards and word of mouth so while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule an independent producer must keep re editing a film no matter how long it takes until the film works perfectly as a result independent films win much of the glory and awards and studio films win most of the gold taking in well over 80 percent of the box office proceeds
177798 at a time when audiences are ebbing piracy is threatening profits and at home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie going equation a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable dvd players or reserved seats it may also be as close to a no risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared and a master to be copied and unlike traditional or even online distribution deals the filmmakers retain all the rights
177799 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges

177868 although 180solutions has come to realize that third party distribution can be hard to police we believe it is possible to properly balance who we do business with while providing monetization methods for the long tail of web publishers and content developers
177869 the advertisers benefit by repeat display of the name of their products google benefits because it does gets paid for the occasional click the cost is my inventory of space not googles so every click is gravy to google and every exposure is value to the advertiser in effect google is giving away exposures on my blog so that they can sell a few clicks which they will dutifully pay me for

177874 la times on the end of the mass moviegoing era
177875 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
177876 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues

177879 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
177880 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings
177881 search engines have the effect of counteracting the skewed distribution of links in the web directing some traffic toward sites that users would never visit otherwise

177883 the big companies have mostly finished their erp and crm implementations which is why oracle has been on a buying binge the action today is in small and medium sized businesses smbs from a service producers point of view how can we service smbs profitably on fairly short engagements with 1 or a few consultants and from the smbs point of view how can they add the it talent that they dont have in house in the short small doses when they need it
177884 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
177885 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it
177886 indie films are typically made before they have u s distribution and with independent financing therefore the producer does not know when if ever the film will be released in theaters so unlike studio films independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign or used to recruit merchandising tie ins independent producers therefore have only a singular product the movie itself to find a distributor they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival at that point if the film is to succeed it must create its own audience through reviews awards and word of mouth so while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule an independent producer must keep re editing a film no matter how long it takes until the film works perfectly as a result independent films win much of the glory and awards and studio films win most of the gold taking in well over 80 percent of the box office proceeds
177887 at a time when audiences are ebbing piracy is threatening profits and at home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie going equation a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable dvd players or reserved seats it may also be as close to a no risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared and a master to be copied and unlike traditional or even online distribution deals the filmmakers retain all the rights
177888 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges
177889 the majority of revenue in search is still made in popular searches rather than the tail in fact over 70 of search revenue is made on just 30 of the searches this shows both the stiff competition that exists for popular keywords and the upside that still exists for paid search as that competition spreads to the tail
177890 three weeks ago sheffields arctic monkeys entered the uk charts at number one with their second single i bet you look good on the dancefloor they had just played their second london gig before an audience of 3 000 even by the hyper speed standards of modern rock and pop this was a remarkable rise apparently made possible only because the band had posted their songs on their website and thus built up a vast virtual fanbase before even securing a record deal

177895 allow people to buy stuff the way they want to so that you can wring every last cent out of your content by earning 1 from someone who isnt willing to spend 10 for the entire book perhaps someone will shortly suggest a subscription model for online books sign up for a membership plan and get to read as many books as you want or a specified monthly quota on your computer but without being able to download or print the books probably too easily hackable but much more appealing to me because it means having a potentially huge number of books available for actual reading on your desktop without even having to trudge down to the library
177896 the executives at dmg still seem to be in the process of choosing a business model last year the company said it planned to beef up hiring so it could sign promote and market undiscovered artists in may it abruptly shifted gears laying off seven of its 15 workers and decided to focus on buying the rights of golden oldies also in the second quarter the company took a 75 000 writedown for a non recoverable advance it made to an unnamed recording artist
177897 in 1976 punk broke onto the music scene and changed the rules of music music was democratized you didnt even need to be able to sing or know how to play music you just needed a guitar now blogging is having the same impact on publishing of course a lot of rubbish gets produced but some great gems get created too that wouldnt have normally been produced under the old system this is the era of punk publishing look around the blogosphere can you spot the sex pistols or the clash can you see a great entrepreneur like the one we got from that era richard branson

177900 the xbox which focuses on highly mature genres catering to hardcore gamers has production costs of 1 82 million a title the gamecube costs half as much at 822 000 a title the real kicker is that the nintendo ds only costs 338 286 a title to develop for even less than the gameboy some of these costs have to do with the hardware and development kits but for the most part they are derived from the scope of the projects being able to develop successful titles at 1 5th the cost of your competitors is a major boost to your bottom line
177901 a great analogy to describe the potential impact of the long tail in book search is to consider the rapid rise of consumer created content online including blogs message boards ratings sites and other forms of social media these platforms are becoming incredibly influential not just because of their sheer popularity and compelling content but because they represent a massively growing share of online content relative to all other such as corporate commercial editorial and government content these more niche social media tend to place very prominently in search engines and therefore can achieve otherwise disproportionate exposure anyone responsible for the reputation of a big corporate brand is often kept up at night by that fact the little guys voice is being heard like never before loud and clear

177909 why is there such a long tail of programming languages in the community and is there an efficient way to satisfy the obvious need for more niche languages and promote the language innovation that happens in the long tail the first question is pretty easy to answer there is a long tail because the more specialized a language is to a domain the better it fits to solve problems for that domain these niche languages trade off generality for efficiency in a domain and they are simply better and more efficient tools for that domain the second question is a bit harder

178066 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges
178067 the majority of revenue in search is still made in popular searches rather than the tail in fact over 70 of search revenue is made on just 30 of the searches this shows both the stiff competition that exists for popular keywords and the upside that still exists for paid search as that competition spreads to the tail

178078 the xbox which focuses on highly mature genres catering to hardcore gamers has production costs of 1 82 million a title the gamecube costs half as much at 822 000 a title the real kicker is that the nintendo ds only costs 338 286 a title to develop for even less than the gameboy some of these costs have to do with the hardware and development kits but for the most part they are derived from the scope of the projects being able to develop successful titles at 1 5th the cost of your competitors is a major boost to your bottom line
178079 a great analogy to describe the potential impact of the long tail in book search is to consider the rapid rise of consumer created content online including blogs message boards ratings sites and other forms of social media these platforms are becoming incredibly influential not just because of their sheer popularity and compelling content but because they represent a massively growing share of online content relative to all other such as corporate commercial editorial and government content these more niche social media tend to place very prominently in search engines and therefore can achieve otherwise disproportionate exposure anyone responsible for the reputation of a big corporate brand is often kept up at night by that fact the little guys voice is being heard like never before loud and clear

178087 why is there such a long tail of programming languages in the community and is there an efficient way to satisfy the obvious need for more niche languages and promote the language innovation that happens in the long tail the first question is pretty easy to answer there is a long tail because the more specialized a language is to a domain the better it fits to solve problems for that domain these niche languages trade off generality for efficiency in a domain and they are simply better and more efficient tools for that domain the second question is a bit harder
178088 bridging the digital divide is all about serving the longest tail by driving down price and driving up access and interoperability what is happening in massachusetts is the beginning of a global realization that governments have a productive obligation to serve the longest tail their citizenry by deploying open accessible standards not the technology of a single company

178098 a true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches where there are just one or even zero customers you need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers so what businesses fit this model the obvious one is ebay omidyars model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you dont find a buyer ebay takes a small listing fee but works better if you do ebay takes a percentage another example is cafepress they dont even set a listing fee working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them they aggregate sales and pay monthly

178107 urban theorist jane jacobs observed many years ago that paradoxically huge cities create environments where small niches can flourish a store selling nothing but buttons most likely wont be able to find a market in a town of 50 000 people but in new york city theres an entire button store district subcultures thrive in big cities for this reason as well if you have idiosyncratic tastes youre much more likely to find someone who shares those tastes in a city of 9 million people

178110 in a world in which consumers can increasingly access precisely what they want on the device and in the location they chose for the price they want to pay the ability to use repackage and market content to meet users higher customization personalization and functionality standards gets you a lucrative seat at the big table but playing that game means changing relationships at every level of the media and entertainment supply and demand food chain from content distributors providers and producers as well as advertisers and marketers
178111 in this new world of choice and control at the edges its the niches and those who can pull them together who win besides a universal top n00 list is even a bad execution of big media think when ad age gives you lists of magazine revenue it separates womens and entertainment and business publications in big media those pass as niches and they are far more valuable comparisons when talking about newspapers you dont lump in metro papers with town papers with trade papers its a meaningless lump when somebody can tell me who the queen of the knitting bloggers is then ill listen and so will knitting advertisers

178119 the long tail approach to keywords advocates the use of
178120 the movie studios to their credit use a form of dynamic pricing they intelligently recognize that a content items value is highest when first released and then subsequently fades the music labels have mostly avoided this strategy but perhaps thats changing i just noticed this little tidbit on amazon a long list of interesting cds for sale on amazon for between 6 and 10

178127 but amazon has a two pronged strategy to monetize the emergence of third party sellers and producers first it has acquired two companies booksurge and custom flicks to facilitate the direct publishing of books and movies which it can then sell second amazon is pushing third party sales via its web site and providing e commerce tools for large etailers 975 000 venders now sell on amazons site and 28 of amazons sales came from third party sellers in q2 up from 24 a year earlier

178139 when i differentiate between artists on smaller independent labels and those on major labels i find that the former gain some market share at the tail end of the curve as a result of the shift to digital markets however that advantage quickly disappears as we move up the curve a more significant trend is that independent artists have actually lost share among the more popular titles to superstar artists on the major labels these results hold when i control for the number and type of titles that artists brought to market thus digital channels may be further strengthening the position of a select group of winners
178140 four years ago 50 of the top 1000 digital tracks were major label

178147 the advertisers benefit by repeat display of the name of their products google benefits because it does gets paid for the occasional click the cost is my inventory of space not googles so every click is gravy to google and every exposure is value to the advertiser in effect google is giving away exposures on my blog so that they can sell a few clicks which they will dutifully pay me for

178153 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
178154 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues

178157 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
178158 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings

178162 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
178163 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it

178198 a true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches where there are just one or even zero customers you need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers so what businesses fit this model the obvious one is ebay omidyars model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you dont find a buyer ebay takes a small listing fee but works better if you do ebay takes a percentage another example is cafepress they dont even set a listing fee working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them they aggregate sales and pay monthly

178273 in both cases a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia
178274 the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government have assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
178275 us investigations show no record of any other rendition through diego garcia or any other overseas territory or through the uk itself since then
178276 the official a frequent participant in white house situation room meetings after september 11 who has since left government says a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being held and interrogated on the island
178277 according to this account the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
178278 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
178279 given everything we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
178280 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the us is vital to the national security of the united kingdom
178281 we accept us assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the uk or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the us authorities

178330 the tactic could cut both ways it might tap into the qualms some white working class voters in crucial swing states may have about a black candidate or it could ricochet back against the mccain campaign which has been accused even by some fellow republicans of engaging in overly negative campaigning in recent days
178331 we have waited for months with a sick feeling knowing this moment would come because we watched it incur with president clinton say whatever you want about president clinton his record on this issue is above reproach
178332 the mccain campaign has obviously been watching our primary very closely and recognized how damaging it had been to be tagged with the charge of race baiting
178333 what they did to mccain in 2000 is what mccains trying to do to barack obama in 2008
178334 the exchange was reminiscent of several flare ups over race during the democratic primaries when the obama campaign complained about comments made by bill clinton in support of the candidacy of his wife
178335 its getting a lot of attention which is exactly what it was designed to do
178336 everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
178337 they ran a ridiculous ad thats insulting not to us but to the american people he said
178338 this is beneath him its beneath sen mccain and now to inject this race card issue takes it one step beyond that you have to ask what happened to john mccain what happened to the campaign he promised to run
178339 obamas pioneering status is inspiring to some voters and discomfiting to others and the way in which race is discussed may push voters toward or away from him mccain could benefit from discomfort with race or he could like hillary rodham clinton his predecessor in battling obama be distracted and ultimately diminished by constant charges of racism accurate or not
178340 its the first time in a while and he doesnt like it
178341 the retort was we must say not only contemptible but shrewd it also and we wish this were coincidence but we doubt it conjures up another loaded racial image the phrase dealing the race card from the bottom of the deck entered the national lexicon during the o j simpson saga
178342 it seems like we hit another low note every day from this campaign
178343 also suggested that obama would rather lose a war than an election is personally responsible for the rise in gas prices and is a celebrity on the order of tabloid divas britney spears and paris hilton
178344 the big question for the mccain campaign is whether this is worth of john mccain or whether it demeans him with frivolousness
178345 three months before election day john mccains stepped up aggression begs the question will voters vote for the scold
178346 in striking an aggressive pose mccain is in danger of letting the caricature of an angry petulant candidate take seed not so much because he is one but because it stands in stark contrast to obamas carefully cultivated well celebrity and mccains own promises to run a respectful campaign
178347 if voters find that obamas image doesnt match the one mccain is peddling they may reject him a lesson jimmy carter learned in 1980 when he painted ronald reagan as dangerous and out of touch

178357 this is a tremendous sum for taxpayers to be doling out to the oil and gas industry
178358 the corporate fat cats at these big oil companies are already earning record profits they dont need our tax dollars too there are far smarter places to use this money including bringing down energy costs by investing in the clean power sources of the future such as wind and solar
178359 but the windfall profits bill which also included measures to rescind some 17 billion in industry tax breaks died a swift death in the senate garnering 51 votes but not enough to overcome a filibuster
178360 that rising energy prices are not the producers fault and that government efforts to punish the industry especially with higher taxes would only make pricing problems worse
178361 we decided that if we didnt do something to help people understand the basics of our industry wed be on the losing end as far as the eye could see
178362 the data increased the likelihood that a recession began late last year
178363 wir m ssen und werden unsere anstrengungen auf der kosten und leistungsseite noch mal verst rken
178364 wir gehen davon aus dass auch 2009 ein sehr anspruchsvolles jahr mit gro en herausforderungen sein wird
178365 we are pleased with our continued improvement in our operating results that we reported for the second quarter of 2008 and also are proud to be in our 32nd consecutive year of paying dividends we are optimistic about our prospects and we believe our stock continues to be undervalued the board has reaffirmed its commitment to the outstanding stock repurchase program and has increased the shares available to repurchase the previous authorization of 750 000 shares had approximately 125 000 shares remaining the board has increased the outstanding authorization to allow for the repurchase of 1 000 000 additional shares of stock
178366 what bothered me the most was when he said he would mop the floor with me
178367 i say when i see you in suite when floods occur i feel like moping the floor with you
178368 the irony is that people reproach me i walk slovenly but i said to myself i should be tidy at all at the meeting with the president of the country
178369 i wish him to the bottom of the sea how could he think about burying our ancestral customs
178370 in both cases a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia
178371 the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government have assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
178372 us investigations show no record of any other rendition through diego garcia or any other overseas territory or through the uk itself since then
178373 the official a frequent participant in white house situation room meetings after september 11 who has since left government says a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being held and interrogated on the island
178374 according to this account the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
178375 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
178376 given everything we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
178377 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the us is vital to the national security of the united kingdom
178378 we accept us assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the uk or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the us authorities
178379 todays time story further demonstrates that the british government has allowed itself to be duped by the us on a colossal scale
178380 while ministers have spent years looking the other way british territory has been used for kidnapping extraordinary rendition illegal imprisonment and possibly torture

178386 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
178387 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and
178388 turning cb1 back on and than treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
178389 in seniors flu vaccine was not linked to a reduced risk of pneumonia
178390 there have been good randomized trials that show at least in healthy seniors that the vaccine reduces the risk of influenza
178391 however earlier studies have overestimated how well the vaccine works in reducing complications of influenza so the vaccine may not reduce the risk of complications as much as previously thought
178392 when you look at the total population of seniors which includes people over 75 and people that have chronic health diseases lung disease heart disease diabetes and things like that we dont know if the vaccine is effective in the seniors
178393 people with these chronic diseases are more susceptible to getting the flu and they are more likely to develop pneumonia if they do get influenza
178394 we know that elderly people do not form sufficient antibodies to certain vaccines the flu vaccine included
178395 in addition people in their 70s and 80s and 90s are more prone to pneumonia with or without influence a number of these pneumonias may be secondary to other causes aside from influenza
178396 having many people vaccinated builds up a herd immunity to disease and you create barriers to transmission
178397 in the best years the flu vaccine is really only 40 to 60 percent effective
178398 there are plenty of flu related complications that are life threatening besides pneumonia
178399 this study is a reminder that flu vaccines are not a panacea but they are valuable because they cut down on the incidence of influenza
178400 flu shots definitely cut down on the number of flu related deaths

178413 it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all of the agencys legal requirements
178414 under this agreement safeguards would be applied to nuclear facilities in india using the same methods as applied elsewhere in the world
178415 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible
178416 the question is can india end safeguards if fuel supplies are interrupted even if theyve conducted a nuclear test or does the agreement require permanent unconditional safeguards

178467 a nivel personal prefiero jugar el primero en casa y el segundo fuera pero los dem s dicen siempre que es mejor jugar el partido de vuelta en casa as que espero que esto ocurra tambi n en nuestro caso
178468 de todos modos da igual que juguemos el primer choque en casa o que lo juguemos fuera lo que hay que dejar claro es que vamos a darlo todo para pasar esta eliminatoria previa

178478 we are hearing voices i believe those inside the rubble will be saved
178479 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
178480 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
178481 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
178482 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
178483 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
178484 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
178485 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
178486 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
178487 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
178488 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
178489 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
178490 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
178491 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
178492 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
178493 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
178494 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
178495 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
178496 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
178497 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
178498 we didnt draw first blood i mean this campaign has been rough and tumble since the day barack obama got his nomination and weve withered under the attacks of the obama campaign on a daily basis
178499 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
178500 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
178501 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
178502 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
178503 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
178504 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
178505 i dont know much about them but i will try to get over there before the first leg to see them
178506 the standard of football over there is quite high but we were never going to get an easy draw its not often you get the chance to play in europe so we are going to make the most of it and enjoy it the younger boys at the club can only benefit its a different type of football and so it will be a great experience and i am going to enjoy it as i enjoyed the scottish cup final last season

178513 hab a peores y hab a mejores es un rival de nuestro nivel la eliminatoria est al cincuenta por ciento soy muy optimista hay que jugar los dos partidos 180 minutos y la ventaja de campo es importante la vuelta en casa es una ventajita que podemos tener
178514 al final el schalke tambi n debe estar preocupado sabiendo que la vuelta es en madrid y que somos un equipo que estamos creciendo que estamos trabajando que hemos fichado bien y que llevamos un par de a os intentando volver a los primeros planos es un rival para volver a los primeros planos

178519 we feel both the verdict and sentence passed are both right and fair
178520 our lives will never be the same again we will always live with the knowledge that we have never had the opportunity to draw any permanent line or put a stop to this
178521 we have not had the opportunity and probably never will to lay david to rest in the normal sense of the word
178522 we pray that wherever he is that he is at rest
178523 entrar en la final ser a un golazo es lo que voy a buscar

178536 johnny would be amazing as the riddler the studio knew they needed someone who could match or even top the late actor heath ledgers performance as the joker in the most recent film the dark knight and think johnny has the potential to do so
178537 it security strategy is in place and enforced to an acceptable degree
178538 the people that the public sector tends to attract are not paid as much as the other components of the industry
178539 normally we find theres a very clear strategy of what needs to be done but there tends to be a focus on technology and not too much on the people and the process
178540 what we found is that canadian companies are different than american and foreign companies with respect to accountability and communication in it security
178541 thats a very important component to explaining to why some employees are more aggressive about implementing adequately
178542 this study is part of an ongoing set of deliverables looking at the management of security in organizations
178543 at the end of last year we looked at where security would be in five years time we held workgroup meetings around the world and backed up this up by questionnaires we gathered a very large dataset to mine data from
178544 the vision of information security going forward is that the degree of change is very significant
178545 for example currently less than 3 out 10 information security professionals believe they are focused on delivering solutions to the business
178546 in the future we predict 6 or 7 out 10 will be focused on delivering solutions
178547 how security interacts with business will change security professionals wont be reporting to the it director currently 5 out of 10 report to the it director but less than a fifth will do so in future
178548 they are typically the same level as the it director the it security professional is moving away from it toward business and business support functions
178549 this move away from the it arena is in part driven by enterprise risk management as well as the convergence of physical and information security ie the merging of the guns and the guards a one stop shop to protect your installation
178550 going forward they want to move towards being more strategic more advisory and providing assurance that the organization is secure

178555 further to the announcement made on july 24th 2008 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date a further announcement will be made in due course
178556 there can be no certainty that the discussions will lead to an offer being made for british energy group
178557 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept
178558 edf is the worlds largest nuclear operator it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
178559 that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder in a publicly listed company it is a now matter for both boards to see how to proceed
178560 the level of interest in nuclear new build in the uk from edf and from other operators remains high
178561 recent developments in energy markets underline the need for new nuclear to combat high fossil fuel prices climate change and security of supply
178562 after in depth discussions edf considers that the conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date

178694 a key issue over buying robinho has always been that real are looking for a replacement
178695 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions
178696 it has not progressed over the last couple of days but the window is open until the end of august and theres still plenty of time to run
178697 it would be a dream for me to work with luiz felipe scolari who is one of the best coaches in the world
178698 i have always spoken highly of him and he has always spoken very highly of me since well before he was at chelsea
178699 in 2003 when i was unknown in europe he called me to play in a charity match it was brief but it was enough for me to see his style and character
178700 madrid have failed to value him as he deserves and i do not like the fact that they tried to include him in the ronaldo deal money is not the problem for us now
178701 what matters for robinho is to leave the club and play for scolari at chelsea
178702 i think there is absolutely no question that any deal will be done with regard to didier drogba
178703 didier is in rehab and will continue to be a chelsea player we can squash that one

178714 on thursday of playing the race card citing his remarks that republicans would try to scare voters by pointing out that he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
178715 im very disappointed and race will not have any role on my campaign nor is there any place for it and im disappointed that hes using it
178716 today mccains campaign manager used even stronger language accusing obama of playing the race card he played it from the bottom of the deck said rick davis its divisive negative shameful and wrong but this afternoon obama campaign manager david plouffe denied outright that obama was making a racial charge
178717 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
178718 youd think that wed be having a serious debate but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with
178719 all i can say that were proud of that commercial
178720 it has become apparent in the past two days that mccain intends as a strategy to criticize obama often and hard
178721 what mccain seems determined to do is define obama on his own terms raise some doubts and maybe by process of elimination you win but its a risky strategy
178722 the risk for mccain some say it could hurt his good guy image
178723 mccain wants the presidential campaign to be about barack obama thats why he talks about him so much to that end mccain is helping frame a not so flattering portrait of obama for voters his ads have become increasingly tough a third of his commercials portray obama negatively a new study concluded
178724 to the growing negative tone of the general election campaign
178725 called the latest punches from the mccain camp character attacks and said the campaign has opened a new web site lowroadexpress
178726 mccains tone has become harsher after extensive media coverage of mr obamas overseas trip and after changes within the campaign
178727 aides say their goal is to pre empt what they believe is obamas effort to paint any conventional campaign attacks as race based obamas aim in the view of the mccain camp to delegitimize any line of attack against him said mccain aide steve schmidt he said he saw that potential trap being sprung when
178728 seized on a record oil company profit to argue that rival john mccain offers only tax breaks for big oil and short term gimmicks to consumers struggling with soaring gasoline prices
178729 quickly incorporated news of exxon mobils nearly 12 billion quarterly profit into his remarks at a town hall meeting

178741 expanded more slowly than expected from april to june the government reported thursday while numbers for the last three months of 2007 were revised downward to show a contraction the first official slide backward since the last recession in 2001
178742 recession worries linger as gdp rises a scant 1 9
178743 the economy contracted at a 0 2 rate in the final months of 2007 its worst showing since the 2001 recession
178744 grew at a modest pace in the second quarter due to strong exports and government stimulus checks but a faltering labor market signaled there may be worse news to come
178745 faster than earlier in the year but slower than economists were expecting
178746 the government now says the economy was receding not growing in the final quarter of last year it picked up a bit in the first quarter of this year but in the second quarter when all these rebate checks were supposed to stimulate the economy it grew less than 2
178747 armed with government stimulus checks of up to 600 per person americans boosted spending on food clothing and other items in the second quarter the commerce department reported but the gross domestic product still increased less than the 2 4 percent economists were looking for
178748 a tale of two economies one propelled by robust growth in exports tied to strongly emerging markets overseas the other mired in recession as consumers at home struggle to cope with record high debts soaring energy prices and falling home prices
178749 the us economy doubled its first quarter rate of growth to 1 9 percent from april through june and some signs emerged that the us economy may have bottomed out
178750 grew at a solid pace despite being buffeted by a financial crisis a deep housing slump high fuel prices and a weak job market
178751 us treasury secretary henry paulson thursday said new economic data prove that the economic stimulus plan has successfully propped up the us economy but said it will take additional months for the housing market the biggest risk to the economy to fully recover
178752 he expects moderate growth in the us economy this year and some stability returning to the housing market in a matter of months
178753 the weakness in us economic growth which mustered an annualized 1 9 percent pace in the second quarter has sparked talk about a second stimulus package ahead of the november presidential election a number of democrats back the idea including the speaker of the house of representatives nancy pelosi
178754 wall street sank thursday after weak readings on economic growth and the job market touched off renewed concerns about the financial health of businesses and consumers
178755 could not shake off its worries about the economy particularly after sobering remarks from former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on cnbc late in the afternoon greenspan said he would be more surprised if the united states did not enter recession than if it did
178756 fell 205 67 or 1 78 percent to 11 378 02 continuing its string of erratic triple digit daily swings
178757 bush said july was a month of encouraging news from iraq
178758 violence is down to levels not seen since the spring of 2004 and the improvements are becoming consistent
178759 made good on an earlier promise confirming that starting tomorrow combat tours for troops heading to iraq and afghanistan will now be reduced from 15 months back to 12
178760 falling violence levels in iraq should allow troop withdrawals there to continue
178761 progress in iraq while potentially reversible has a degree of durability
178762 appeared to lay the groundwork for an announcement in coming weeks of further us troop reductions
178763 some read that as a hint from the president that troop reductions are imminent but secretary gates wasnt ready to pre empt general petraeuss recommendation
178764 bush and his aides have been reluctant to declare the sharp drop in ethnic and sectarian violence over the last year as irreversible still he gave the clearest indication yet that conditions in iraq would allow him to begin reducing the number of american troops there before he leaves office in less than six months
178765 the commanding general of day to day operations of the war iraq hasnt yet reached the point of sustainable security many in the leaders of al qaida in iraq have departed as have militant shiite leaders whore now believed to be hiding in iran but they dont plan to stay abroad austin said
178766 soldiers cant afford to let their guards down iraq may be quieter
178767 gen david petraeus is determined not to declare victory early
178768 while the number of us casualties in iraq is declining the number in afghanistan continues to rise 16 us troops were killed in afghanistan in july thats the second highest monthly total since the war began
178769 rejected the bush administrations sweeping assertion of executive privilege and ruled that two white house aides must answer subpoenas from congress
178770 said that the aides could cite executive privilege and refuse to answer specific questions once they were in front of congress
178771 the ruling by us district judge john d bates doesnt settle the larger question of whether
178772 can assert executive privilege to refuse to respond to specific questions from congress
178773 a blow to the bush administrations efforts to bolster the power of the executive branch at the expense of the legislative branch
178774 would be required to cooperate with the house judiciary committee which has been investigating the controversial dismissal of the federal prosecutors in 2006
178775 batess decision will likely not end the squabble the justice department which represents the white house is expected to appeal officials with the committee and the justice department could not be reached for comment
178776 said the ruling could give congress a new impetus to hold rove in contempt
178777 president bush says hes using his last six months in office to push new energy plans that include electricity from coal
178778 the west virginia coal association gathered at the greenbrier resort
178779 reliable sources of electricity must be part of a strong economy and there is no more reliable source of electricity than coal
178780 took another shot today at enticing cajoling or shaming democratic lawmakers into doing something about the energy crunch once again there was much more talk than action on capitol hill and the stumbling block continues to be the republican call for new domestic oil drilling
178781 insisted his administration has been pushing a variety of new energy plans including clean coal technology and will continue to do so for the third straight day he said when it comes to oil and natural gas congress wont allow votes on practical solutions like domestic drilling
178782 as congress begins a five week break without passing legislation to address high gasoline prices democrats and republicans are fighting for the political high ground in the energy debate
178783 flurry of ads and on the campaign trail republicans are pounding democrats for failing to allow votes on lifting a federal ban on oil and gas drilling in offshore areas to boost domestic production
178784 are accusing republicans of blocking renewable energy initiatives and protecting wealthy oil companies at consumers expense
178785 democrats will head into the august recess friday with the shadow of gas prices hanging over them following a mix up about whether house speaker nancy pelosi d calif had hinted that she might allow a vote on new oil drilling
178786 struggles to cope with the energy crisis threaten to obscure a string of victories it has racked up on other domestic issues such as housing medicare unemployment and veterans benefits
178787 with gas prices hovering at 4 a gallon a majority of floridians now support drilling for oil in protected areas offshore according to a new poll the survey finds support for drilling at 60 percent with 10 percent of respondents telling pollsters that theyd opposed offshore drilling in the past thirty six percent of respondents said they remain opposed to offshore drilling
178788 well the campaigns starting to get nasty have you seen the new commercial the mccain campaign compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton and today the obama campaign released an ad comparing john mccain to zsa zsa gabor and bea arthur
178789 obamas people are trying to portray mccain as cranky and mccain is trying to portray obama as arrogant you see
178790 and when mccain was asked about being labeled cranky he told the reporter to go to hell
178791 in a speech yesterday barack obama said hes distantly related to the famous 19th century gunslinger wild bill hickock after hearing this john mccain said big deal i went to high school with him
178792 president bush is on the hunt for a new home i guess his master plan of massive foreclosures and plummeting real estate prices has finally paid off because he should get a good deal
178793 it is with great pride and a lot of joy that i announce today that we have found proof that this hard bright material is really water ice and not some other substance
178794 it sets up a system of cooperation and networking between different agencies
178795 they are really trying to set the next team up to walk in the door and have a functioning government and they are doing it in a way thats workable for a republican or democrat
178796 all it basically does is bring the old executive order up to date with new structure which is necessary but it doesnt fundamentally change anything beyond that

178906 one of the challenges for larger advertisers automobile cigarettes etc is when theyre executing programs especially with magazines does it have enough scale to warrant creating a display

178913 were working with dubai right now and if it works out that could be very big
178914 those are the kinds of things you reach out for what you typically would not look for this time last year i wouldnt have sent my sales manager to dubai
178915 typically ads on our web sites are static and not based on a cpm model
178916 weve gone to more text style link ads that tend to drive more traffic than a cube people dont tend to click on web ads but will click on text
178917 were usually the biggest line item on their marketing budget and were often twice as expensive as other magazines out there
178918 its the easiest thing in the world at conde nast corporate contracts are negotiated on revenue and its out of our hands
178919 weve had to be creative in creating regional opportunities for advertisers that want to be in the magazine but cant make the leap nationally first
178920 we have top 10 metro buys buys california only buys those are usually the way you find companies entering our brands and as their business grows they grow into a national buy
178921 its interesting to see where advertisers will have money in the budget
178922 they may not have money for an ad but they will have it for a cocktail reception more and more were saying well produce a cocktail reception and you can fly in under our banner
178923 there are ways of finding money and the key is finding where the sweet spot is
178924 if youre just talking to marketing directors or agencies youre never going to get it you have to go direct now go right into executive level decision making if you dont do that youll just be in more pain theres no magic bullet in this ive been through four of these i know how the story ends
178925 when you hear an advertiser say they have to trim an insertion do we still execute on the added value or do we trim it back 20 percent
178926 we try to take a long term approach with our long term partners if youre both on same page and honest and direct you can work it out even if there are a lot of hard costs tied into the value added component understand the clients objectives early so you can be out ahead

178929 global meds vision is to provide comprehensive solutions for the blood management software industry we realize that effective donor recruitment is strategically important to our customers edonors significant market share and their innovative solutions make this acquisition a logical next step in our evolution we feel strongly that edonor will benefit both existing and new blood bank customers of global meds wyndgate technologies r division and global meds recent international acquisition of inlog sa
178930 with the edonor acquisition global med will now have 13 software applications specifically geared toward donor centers and hospitals

178939 we have been looking at virtual events for the past four or five years but the market didnt seem ready for it
178940 earlier this year the planets came together with travel budgets cutting back the rise in social networking and the ability to reach an international audience
178941 virtual events have always been very good at the education part now youre starting to see better social networking
178942 when someone can see someone else its like the difference between hdtv and a black and white set
178943 in one section one of the speakers was really bullish on silver and this conversation developed between attendees on the merits of investing in silver
178944 occasionally forbes com editors would chime in but by and large attendees had their own conversation
178945 it wouldnt have had peer or vendor interaction now ibm gets the benefit of an educational platform and peer interaction
178946 the exhibitors can get access to the attendee database in a way they cant get at a live event
178947 forty five percent of our attendees are outside so we better be ready to man the booths virtually 24 7
178948 were looking at coupling online events with more targeted tabletop events
178949 when we compare our virtual events to a live event on contribution levels it was as successful if not more successful because you dont have expenses like hall rental and f amp b i think this event can stand side by side with our largest live event and at some point may exceed it in revenue and contribution
178950 the dynamics of how attendees want to walk a virtual show is something we need to further understand
178951 if i walk into a live show the pouncing begins how can we train our exhibitors to not pounce on attendees virtually we need to train the exhibitors on maximizing their participation
178952 i did not start this company six years ago to flip it
178953 it certainly makes sense that the guardian was the buyer for two reasons first they are looking to expand into the and rafat will be able to introduce them to just about anyone in media and the internet secondly the value of the pound versus the dollar makes the acquisition look cheaper to the guardian than it would to others
178954 summit is taking advantage of the challenging conditions of the financial industry to strengthen their business at attractive valuations
178955 through our drovers brand magazine web site and e letters we reach the top 100 000 cattle operations in the country
178956 cattlenetwork and cattlestore enable us to offer marketers reach into the hundreds of thousands of smaller cattle operations which buy a significant amount of the products and services sold in this industry
178957 its understandable why these sites were attractive to vance this is a strategic tuck in deal for vance and a nice addition to their digital presence
178958 petters appears not to have other media assets so it seems to be a fit that they will make into a good one rather than the other way around some small synergies like the airline relationship are starting points but not enough to buy a company so petters has something else in mind

178975 we had already explained in the takeover agreements with phoenix that we were looking for a suitable buyer for phoenix dichtungstechnik as this division does not fit into our core business

178977 phoenix dichtungstechnik is an exceptional addition to our existing portfolio of mid cap european companies we expect pdt to grow and will make targeted investments in its expansion we will increase the investment volume in a sustainable way and so support the management in developing additional markets of interest
178978 we give long term financial support to expanding mid cap companies and are convinced that in financing phoenix dichtungstechnik gmbh we are investing in a company that is a leader in its production base of germany

178984 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
178985 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
178986 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
178987 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
178988 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
178989 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
178990 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
178991 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
178992 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
178993 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
178994 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
178995 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
178996 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
178997 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
178998 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap
178999 they have to submit a cv curriculum vitae of their credentials be approved by the site editors and also confirm their e mail address when an article is posted it can be approved by an editor and this status is shown
179000 las cuestiones que dicen en esa propuesta tenemos que estudiarlas muy bien y en su momento daremos respuesta

179005 claro que animo a las parejas casadas a rezar para que tengan una buena y feliz vida sexual para ellos es un medio de acercarse a dios
179006 la gente est un poco sorprendida al principio pero agradablemente sorprendida
179007 si crees en dios crees que dios est presente en la vida en el amor en el matrimonio y en la sexualidad parece natural hablar de sexo y suprimir algunos tab es y etiquetas del pecado
179008 el amor de una pareja casada expresado en el sexo acerca el cuerpo humano al cielo el xtasis de una relaci n sexual puede compararse a la alegr a de la vida eterna
179009 por eso este acto conyugal permite a los esposos empezar a entender la dulzura del encuentro con dios
179010 no necesit is padecer una enfermedad del coraz n para ser cardi logo ni ser alcoh lico para convertirse en terapeuta
179011 escucha realmente a las parejas y por eso nos entiende bien

179020 london underground is a low crime environment but we know there is always more work to be done
179021 the teams are now up and running and our staff look forward to getting to know them over the coming months and working with them in the future
179022 we gave every opportunity to the landlord to put these serious faults right but we were forced to prosecute finally for the safety of her tenants
179023 we hope that the level of this fine will be a warning to other landlords on the importance of keeping their accommodation in good order and taking prompt action to ensure the health and wellbeing of their tenants

179030 la forma en que se mov a no era ostentosa no llevaba un aparato de seguridad porque hab a logrado mimetizarse en el medio
179031 no sunshine everything is wet final days food we yawed a lot during the gale causing a lot of water to wash across the deck the slightest manoeuvre left us soaked to the skin the
179032 all modern philosophy is political and police like restricted to the appearance of learning through the ruling powers churches academies customs and human cowardice
179033 hi pat just want someone to know how hard this whole life thing is no need to call but i just wanted to vent packing up my life is v hard and i think takes more strength than i have
179034 any establishment which dispenses food for consumption on or off the premises and which has the following characteristics a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
179035 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
179036 wed always back ourselves but we know its going to be difficult
179037 theres so much at stake not just in financial terms but in terms of prestige the competition in england is going to be an incredible experience and wed like to be there
179038 the fact that it looks like there is going to be a third place with the likelihood of zimbabwe withdrawing then it takes a wee bit of the pressure off
179039 it means if we lose in the semi final then were going to have a second chance to qualify that third and fourth place place off game will probably be the most tensed match of the entire competition
179040 we have a strong squad with players who are ideally suited to this form of the game
179041 in john blain and dewald nel i feel weve got the best new ball attack among the associate teams its such a bonus to have guys who take wickets up front and they do it consistently to peg back the opposition
179042 i open the batting in the one day format and i see no reason to change that gavin hamilton has started to open and has done quite well well also have navdeep poonia and kyle coetzer available from the counties so we have options
179043 unfortunately weve been hit with a few injuries our former captain craig wright misses out as he has a back injury that combined with the loss of gordon goudie means that there is an opportunity for the others to step up
179044 an opening fixture with ireland in ireland is about as tough as it gets as a tournament opener this should be a great one for fans of both countries
179045 in the twenty20 format anything can happen but i think ireland and scotland are the two favourite sides because they are playing in familiar conditions while we are coming from hot conditions
179046 we have worked extremely hard in england on a pre event tour and have made sure we have all the resources and have all bases covered
179047 we have to qualify for next years event because its extremely vital to the development of the game in kenya there is no point in having a good team that cannot perform
179048 i wasnt originally supposed to be in the squad but weve had a few injuries and ive been asked to come back in and help out
179049 were in a tough group but then there are no easy fixtures when you are at this level
179050 canada and kenya are strong teams but you have to look at yourself and your own strengths if we play to our potential then we will be hopeful of making it
179051 since this is a new concept players arent experienced enough which gives us a good chance to produce good results
179052 it is a fast paced format and you have to match that pace and the 11 players need to fire to get the desired results
179053 it is fundamental that these legislative elections are conducted in a satisfactory manner and in line with international standards
179054 there is no doubt in my mind that the accused persons have cases to answer with the regard to the charges preferred against them
179055 serious concern about the continued politically motivated violence and violation of the fundamental rights of perceived and confirmed members of the mdc by war veterans

179068 herheims idea was to make a bold leap through time from the original performance in 1882 into the post war years of the bundesrepublik from the weapon rattling of the empire through the dual world war catastrophes and on into the sober democratic new start he wanted to show how the opera which is seemingly sealed off in its mythology bubble was instrumentalised and abused throughout the history of the bayreuth festival by the respective zeitgeist what was designed to be pure was rapidly soiled original sin sullies not only the characters in the opera but the parsifal itself right from birth
179069 one of the slowest parsifal conductors to ever work in bayreuth
179070 perhaps this neglect and the excessive power of the imagery so inhibited the singers that none of them dared to use the stage design to their advantage
179071 daniele gatti elicits exquisitely resonant sounds from the orchestra but his overstretched interpretation freed of all accent and rhetoric left the singers out of breath and the audience bored
179072 cartarescu speaks about the two former informants professional aptitude in glowing terms one is supposed to have written a radical book about utopia whilst the other is an apparently an outstanding germanist this directly leads to the claim that morality and intellectual accomplishments rarely go hand in hand and then something staggering happens cartarescu names heidegger hamsun ezra pound celine and drieu la rochelle as examples for his argument this is scandalous not one of these characters served as an informant for the gestapo they all expressed their political views much more openly and accessibly they were all stupendously mistaken but they were publicly mistaken and so were publicly held accountable
179073 reading the essays today one is struck that a writer during the war whose living and working conditions were greatly hampered still managed to deliver a four to five page article on a weekly basis and that moreover whatever the subject he was writing about he was always able to maintain a consistently elegant style thats quite aside from the fact that he managed an almost inconceivable reading workload stretching from medieval to contemporary literature from meister eckart and nicolaus cusanus through to montherlant kafka and james joyce blanchots concept light but image heavy arguments are not easy to understand but provide plenty of mental fodder which is certainty what lends the enthralling aspect to his texts whose logical untenability and metaphorical swirling open the floodgates to even the most audacious readings but the difficulties of understanding the text are not off putting on the contrary they are stimulating inviting liberating
179074 my parents are looking at me its about midnight we hear shots outside again and again there is no rhythm to the shots as there normally is when serbs are firing in wars it doesnt sound like dadadadada but more like tak tak tak the bullets obviously land somewhere very quickly in a body in flesh i suspect people are being killed the serbs are killing boys and men outside the door
179075 i am well aware of what im getting myself into here i can quite imagine that at the same time we are exhibiting there might be a madonna crying tears of sperm right next door that recently showed in bologna or a scene of the last supper where the disciples are masturbating which is now in vienna and by the way was drawn by an outstanding artist in alfred hrdlicka there is something for everyone these days
179076 according to the law as an indonesian citizen you dont have to be a muslim although you do have to be monotheistic at the same time many indonesians interpret this principle as a minimal definition of islam in this sense all indonesians classify as muslims this not so much paternalism as an impressive attempt to make the commitment to islam compatible with religious pluralism it displays hermeneutic flexibility as well as a love of peace
179077 ramadan and his followers are trying to reinterpret the basic rights and values of european civil society they deny the right of
179078 i am someone who has seen an apparition of the nazarene painting i think i was six or seven perhaps even eight at the time mary appeared to me one morning it was not in a dream i was already awake the vision took place in the room where i slept i cannot tell you precisely what mary was wearing but she had on a light beige and blue dress she looked exactly like a pre rafaelite or nazarene painting today i would say she looked kitsch mary did not speak to me she smiled
179079 if islam wants to recover and escape its own curse it will have to set up camp on post islamic territory which historically speaking lies on a level with jewish and christians worlds this is indispensable if the community of nations is to function as such but islamic countries and saudi arabia in particular are content to force their citizens into practising moderate islam to keep them away from extremist circles they use theological arguments to try to isolate the extremists by labelling them ghulu the mass which the koran rejects and spurns this is a praiseworthy step but oh so insufficient and timid particularly when theyre up against the islamic community in europe
179080 it was our chairman in france who decided to cancel the ntd tv signal it seems there was a genuine technical problem with the w5 satellite but it was still functioning the cancellation of ntd tv should be understood as a friendly gesture towards china the eutelsat representative said on the phone
179081 we the undersigned journalists political columnists scientists and artists support bruckners appeal and demand that the member states of the european union and germany in particular boycott the durban 2 conference and commit themselves to sweeping reforms of the un human rights commission
179082 more interesting than the comparison of east and west is the question of how
179083 im just having fun and trying to win games and thats it i just try not to think about whats going on and just take it one at bat at a time and try and do something every day to help us win thats it keep it simple
179084 well sometimes youve got to get lucky and turn on a few and then the key for me is using the whole field
179085 if theyre throwing it away just keep hitting it to left if they start coming in turn on it and make it tough on where theyre going to pitch you
179086 it was a little different this year going in a little more relaxed and just have fun with it
179087 i didnt want to use that as an excuse its just one of those things and hopefully the swing can keep feeling good
179088 hitting fourth the past couple of years and fifth before that and being in that spot the more i get up there the more comfortable i feel
179089 you try to do less when youre younger you start trying to do more and put pressure on yourself to come through in those situations now you just relax and have confidence in the guy behind you if they dont give you anything to hit take the walk and make it easy on yourself dont try and do too much you learn as you get older that simpler is sometimes better and you just have to find that
179090 its something that every kid playing peewee football in eden prairie like i did dreams about someday playing for the vikings so its great to be out here and be part of the team
179091 thats certainly a career path to envy and hopefully i get a chance to have that same kind of success here i think this is a great team and a great organization hopefully i can grow and become a better player here
179092 the evolution from the college game to the pro game of being aware of whats going on around you ratchets up even again
179093 its a huge jump from high school to college and again from college to the pros of having to know whats going on on the entire field and not just the 5 yards around you thats definitely taking a little bit of getting used to
179094 i knew that i probably wasnt going to get drafted but that i would have a shot as a priority free agent
179095 so i wasnt disappointed i just wanted to get everything figured out about where i was going to be afterwards and im glad it ended up being here
179096 our country has a commitment to handover the peninsula by august 14 and so far nothing has changed
179097 if there are legal hurdles the president is fully committed to addressing those hurdles so that the handover can go on as planned
179098 nigeria will not abandon its sovereign responsibilities and international obligations
179099 to file the necessary motions to overturn the ruling and i think he will do that on friday
179100 this order is not capable of being obeyed because this court cannot sit as an appellate court on the judgment of the international court of justice in the hague
179101 we know that we are bound by the judgment of the icj
179102 guillermo ochoas agent has claimed that everton have inquired about signing the goalkeeper from club america
179103 samuel has to have an agreement after this we will start negotiations but first he has to be happy
179104 we are waiting for this agreement when we know well know what his situation is we will know what he can give to us
179105 of course big clubs are interested but this is not important first he needs to have an agreement with a club
179106 if he moves itll be to a big club of course there are four or five clubs interested
179107 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants
179108 you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
179109 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
179110 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
179111 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
179112 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
179113 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
179114 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
179115 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
179116 there is no more reliable source of electricity than coal
179117 wed like to get additional troops there as soon as we could
179118 there now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
179119 wanted coachmen must be sober industrious and reliable no irish need apply
179120 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
179121 cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
179122 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
179123 measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
179124 if i could describe the new national defense strategy in one word it would be balance
179125 i would take his call now i will take his call when hes president any time remember no matter who is president i dont see this as a political thing i see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is
179126 if obama is running around talking about change maybe this is the year of change
179127 this is our opportunity lets take the word change yes lets change the system in california because there needs to be change
179128 hes never been afraid to throw nominees under the bus
179129 in his own election in 06 you know he abandoned every republican on the ticket so the fact that hes wishy washy in his comments now is nothing new for him
179130 he stayed strong stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out now weve got a real man with an american plan were going to put him in the big white house
179131 i wanted to offer him something that he didnt have a rally song one that really captures that maverick spirit
179132 he was physically tortured for years and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our country for decades
179133 the entire world is looking for a way to sucker punch us
179134 national security is absolutely at the top of the list of issues thats why i think john mccain is the guy to keep us safe
179135 country music in general is behind fred thompson for president
179136 reflect my full views on the broader issues regarding tolerance and the treatment of gays and lesbians in our society
179137 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
179138 when you have something bleeding like this there can be a lot of money saved
179139 from a management standpoint this is something that can easily be handled
179140 its critical use or necessary use versus well weve got the money lets go out and buy some more cars
179141 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
179142 historic steps to provide students with the tools the means and the power to get a higher education
179143 i feel like weve been on third base for 6 years
179144 to address soaring costs this legislation will address the transparency and the accountability of the tuition pricing system shining a bright light on the prices set by colleges and universities
179145 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
179146 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
179147 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
179148 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
179149 tonight congress sent a message to women across the country your work is valued
179150 people are literally being poisoned by their diets las idea deserves serious consideration as we look for holistic solutions to a serious problem a moratorium may help stem the problem
179151 they should just let people eat what they want to eat
179152 ca va r veiller ce qui restait de leur relation et elle se demandera

179158 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
179159 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
179160 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
179161 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
179162 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
179163 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
179164 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
179165 yes stevens is the longest sitting senator and could be facing jail time but on the other hand this cat is enormous
179166 it broke me heart i wanted him to have a good home
179167 never had an orgasm from anything in 27 years of being married
179168 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
179169 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
179170 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
179171 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
179172 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
179173 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
179174 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
179175 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
179176 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
179177 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
179178 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
179179 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
179180 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
179181 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
179182 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
179183 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
179184 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
179185 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
179186 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
179187 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
179188 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
179189 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
179190 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
179191 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
179192 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
179193 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
179194 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
179195 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
179196 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
179197 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
179198 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
179199 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
179200 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
179201 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
179202 he just said we need to do all these things
179203 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
179204 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
179205 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
179206 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
179207 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
179208 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
179209 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
179210 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
179211 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
179212 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
179213 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
179214 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
179215 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
179216 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
179217 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
179218 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
179219 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
179220 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
179221 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
179222 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
179223 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
179224 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
179225 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
179226 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
179227 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
179228 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
179229 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
179230 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
179231 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
179232 junk propaganda emanating from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and scientists like david suzuki et al
179233 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
179234 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
179235 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
179236 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
179237 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
179238 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
179239 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet

179248 hay una negaci n una cuesti n muy vigente de sostener que aqu no hay indios y eso pasa por el tema de que se prohibi en alguna poca hablar el quechua que es la lengua materna de estos pueblos se neg la existencia de ellos y por eso el com n de la gente piensa que ya no est n m s y lo que queda de los indios est en los museos

179256 neither senator john s mccain nor senator barack h obama have been particularly mindful of the budget deficit mccain has proposed to extend all of bushs first term tax cuts which expire in 2011 and add hundreds of billions of additional tax cuts mostly for business obama would allow only the tax cuts for the most affluent families making 250 000 or more to expire leaving the lions share in place and adding additional tax cuts for the working poor and middle class
179257 the bush administration has spent heavily on the wars in iraq and afghanistan and faces a large budget shortfall in tax revenue because of bushs tax cuts and a souring economy
179258 took turns explaining why they liked mr obama and recalling the strange stares from other republicans

179264 finally we understand that the civil rights movement was a lot bigger and longer than martin luther king as wonderful and important as he was
179265 there are so many levels on which this movement was important not only statewide but nationwide
179266 and theres no question ruby was in the absolute forefront
179267 as long as they graduated and walked across that stage that was enough
179268 it was exciting to see how poor people could stand up
179269 just the way she looked you could feel her power it was so uplifting
179270 im glad shes finally being recognized for all that shes done
179271 so many people give up homes so many jobless people

179274 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
179275 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there

179283 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
179284 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
179285 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
179286 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
179287 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
179288 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
179289 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
179290 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
179291 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
179292 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
179293 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
179294 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
179295 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
179296 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
179297 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
179298 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
179299 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
179300 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
179301 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
179302 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
179303 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
179304 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
179305 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
179306 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
179307 the voters we need to get are people not a whole lot unlike obama
179308 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
179309 are you better off now than you were four years ago
179310 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
179311 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
179312 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
179313 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
179314 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
179315 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
179316 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
179317 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
179318 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
179319 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
179320 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
179321 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
179322 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
179323 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
179324 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
179325 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
179326 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
179327 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
179328 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
179329 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
179330 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
179331 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
179332 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
179333 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
179334 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
179335 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
179336 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
179337 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
179338 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
179339 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
179340 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
179341 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
179342 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
179343 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
179344 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
179345 we should tax what we burn not what we earn
179346 the only republican who promises to end the of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
179347 a broader range of americans than the rest of the republican field
179348 hard to find an issue on which he has not repositioned himself to the right since he was
179349 the real straight talker a profile in courage more seasoned than the current president a patriot of course honest and respected in the media he has all the pluses in the world of a sort of a you know an if you will a real war hero
179350 the environment is the voters number one concern about continued republican leadership of congress
179351 o ur nations continued prosperity hinges on our ability to solve environmental problems and sustain the natural resources on which we all depend
179352 we have two oilmen in the white house the logical follow up from that is 3 a gallon gasoline it is no accident it is a cause and effect a cause and effect
179353 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
179354 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
179355 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
179356 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
179357 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
179358 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
179359 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
179360 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
179361 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
179362 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
179363 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
179364 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
179365 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
179366 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
179367 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
179368 the blacks and the unions killed this town vote republican
179369 the man and the rich white folks keep this city back vote democratic
179370 so i have to ask you howd you go from living on the upper eastside to st louis
179371 i moved there for him he was gorgeous he was talented he was sexy
179372 the blacks and the unions killed this town vote republican
179373 the man and the rich white folks keep this city back vote democratic
179374 the good lord was sold out for 30 pieces of silver we were sold out for 70 a share
179375 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
179376 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
179377 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
179378 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
179379 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
179380 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
179381 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
179382 sekali lagi terima kasih banyak buat awank yang telah sangat mencurahkan segenap kekuatannya untuk men servis saya

179385 our stand is for the betterment of the north and the interest of nigeria they should withdraw their appeal from the court it is god that gives power to whom he pleases
179386 with regards to the impeachment process initiated by the adamawa house of assembly against the executive governor of which the governor was alleged to have committed some acts of misconduct which we believe that the process is in line with democratic norms and values and in accordance with the provision of our constitution the peace forum finds it necessary to intervene in this matter on the side of peace and harmony in the state it is our earnest desire that the matter be resolved amicably between the honourable house and the executive so that the state can move forward
179387 in the area of infrastructural development in the north especially the deplorable condition of roads which is worst in the country lack of youths empowerment poor health services poor education facilities and inadequate electricity supply we are deeply concerned about all this and call on president yaradua to extend his hand
179388 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
179389 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
179390 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
179391 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
179392 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
179393 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
179394 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
179395 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
179396 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
179397 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

179405 by taking american grown biomass from trees corn husks and grasses and putting them in our vehicles csu is going toe to toe with opec and tackling our dependence on foreign oil
179406 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
179407 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
179408 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
179409 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
179410 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
179411 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
179412 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
179413 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
179414 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
179415 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
179416 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
179417 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
179418 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
179419 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
179420 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
179421 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
179422 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
179423 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
179424 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
179425 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
179426 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
179427 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
179428 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
179429 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
179430 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
179431 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
179432 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
179433 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
179434 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
179435 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
179436 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
179437 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
179438 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
179439 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
179440 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
179441 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
179442 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
179443 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
179444 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
179445 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
179446 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

179448 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
179449 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
179450 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
179451 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
179452 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
179453 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
179454 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
179455 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
179456 would necessarily have less force particularly when the sitting president does not support the claim of privilege
179457 het gaat om een omgebouwde toyota corolla die zou een reikwijdte hebben van 150 kilometer per uur en een topsnelheid halen van 120 kilometer per uur
179458 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
179459 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
179460 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
179461 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
179462 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
179463 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
179464 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
179465 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
179466 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
179467 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
179468 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
179469 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
179470 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
179471 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
179472 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
179473 when you have something bleeding like this there can be a lot of money saved
179474 from a management standpoint this is something that can easily be handled
179475 its critical use or necessary use versus well weve got the money lets go out and buy some more cars
179476 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
179477 cost of paying one driver overtime to cover both weekday shifts and weekends would be prohibitive
179478 kind of a rule of thumb is the more cars you control the more powerful you are and so that sort of attitude of kingdom building is part of the problem here
179479 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
179480 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
179481 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
179482 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
179483 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
179484 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
179485 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
179486 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
179487 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
179488 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
179489 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
179490 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
179491 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
179492 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
179493 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
179494 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
179495 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
179496 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
179497 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
179498 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
179499 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
179500 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
179501 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
179502 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
179503 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
179504 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
179505 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
179506 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
179507 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
179508 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
179509 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
179510 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
179511 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
179512 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
179513 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
179514 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
179515 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
179516 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
179517 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
179518 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
179519 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
179520 as a person that has done a tremendous lot for art development in this country i was deeply offended and insulted by the letter i told the committee in no uncertain terms that i would not leave the matter be
179521 the vice rector erina junius admitted she only signed the letter but did not write it
179522 this confirmed my suspicions that other people are behind the un called for efforts of suspect making
179523 after a lengthy meeting a compromise was reached it was proposed and decided that my colleagues and i would go on an urgent retreat to discuss and come up with a suitable solution to the non accreditation of the african performing arts course after the retreat we will report back to the management committee and submit a formal application to the namibia qualifications authority
179524 were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government polytechnic without newspapers or newspapers without a government polytechnic i should not hesitate a moment to have the latter
179525 selfishness by sierra leoneans is being practiced in every nook and cranny of society it is even more prominent in certain reputable institutions government offices
179526 for a tree to grow properly it needs several good things good soil good seed and good rains
179527 in essence the regional curriculum symposium will become a discussion forum that will inform us of the technical skills required to ensure that we nurture our audiovisual industries in the continent
179528 in light of the need to establish the african film commission fepaci sees film training or curriculum as an important component that needs to be revisited so as to ascertain quality output in african filmmaking
179529 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
179530 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
179531 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
179532 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
179533 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
179534 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
179535 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
179536 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
179537 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
179538 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
179539 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
179540 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
179541 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
179542 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
179543 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
179544 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
179545 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
179546 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
179547 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
179548 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
179549 wir haben lange zeit ohne irgendetwas zu essen zugebracht wir berlebten dank rohem fisch und regenwasser
179550 sie waren so schwach dass sie kaum selbst aufstehen konnten
179551 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
179552 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
179553 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
179554 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
179555 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
179556 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
179557 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
179558 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
179559 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
179560 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
179561 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
179562 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
179563 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
179564 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
179565 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
179566 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing children
179567 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
179568 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
179569 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
179570 i have left the party and the press office as i feel that the current programme for government of the stormont administration will put working class communities under increased pressure at a time when the current global credit crunch is already hurting this vulnerable group in society i also feel that the partys left wing credentials have been damaged by the above and by a continued courtship with the american administration
179571 one of the bad things about the internet is that you pay attention to your commenters
179572 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
179573 yes its a rap about particle physics yes it mentions antimatter and the bbc report an
179574 criminal and anti social elements who are using this bonfire as a cover for other activities
179575 while the provincial man looks to the opinion of the metropolis the parochial is never in any doubt about the social and artistic validity of his parish
179576 these cases are due to come before the tribunals and will be strenuously defended by ofmdfm in the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment further
179577 one thing that should not be allowed is the glorification in song or story of what was mean and nasty and dirty
179578 there is always the risk of the re emergence of a cyclical pattern as a generation of young people who have not experienced the actuality the horror and the cost of violence react against the ineffectiveness of politics and politicians their predecessors having been persuaded to turn away from violence on the promise that politics could deliver
179579 if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him
179580 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
179581 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
179582 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
179583 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
179584 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
179585 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
179586 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
179587 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
179588 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god

179599 the previous australian government is responsible for another terrible crime by forcing refugees to be sent back to gaza when they knew the situation there
179600 this guy had problems with israel and the palestinian authority he claimed to have been tortured and the previous government knew all that and still forced him out
179601 it is a tragedy because we have lost another young person who who could have been a good australian citizen
179602 its a tragic story that could have been prevented if we would have been a bit more humane to asylum seekers who have a case
179603 and if we wouldnt have sent him away he may well be alive and well amongst us at the moment

179619 it is important to note that these represent the largest criminal fines and civil settlements in canadian history
179620 todays announcement sends a clear message that governments right across canada are united in their effort to enforce canadas tobacco tax laws it also demonstrates the governments continued commitment and ongoing effort to fight contraband tobacco in this country
179621 this is a case of legitimate business exploiting circumstances and geography
179622 the message sent today is that no company is above the law
179623 aiding persons to sell and be in possession of tobacco manufactured in canada that was not packed and was not stamped in conformity with the excise act and its amendments and ministerial regulations
179624 were pretty pleased and satisfied that this case is closed
179625 its been ongoing for a long time and the resolution gives us the ability to move forward
179626 the tobacco crisis of the early 1990s is well known in canada and we are pleased today to close this chapter of our history
179627 governments acknowledge that by settling today we have ensured the co operation of these companies to fight the availability of contraband tobacco for many years to come
179628 todays events give our business the stability it needs to move forward to address with clarity and focus the issues opportunities and challenges it faces today and will face in the future
179629 these cases do not reflect the present day tobacco smuggling environment in this country which is dominated by foreign manufacturers smuggling their illicit products into canada largely under the control of organized criminal groups

179650 life scars the writer but he is not without weapons of vengeance the art of writing is a prism that he can use to refract human experience that one can write about something gives him courage to endure it that he has written about it gives him if not deeper understanding some kind of peace in other words the writer is first a human being before he is anything else prone like much of mankind to fits of joy and pain what happens to those around him and yes to him is legitimate material but only if he is able to illumine it with a special insight

179656 well take any boat with us no matter what brand it is
179657 its the best way to take care of the boats we wont lose sight of them
179658 a normal trailer would take up too much space and space is money
179659 i am convinced that the container is much safer on a boat than on a plane
179660 if everything goes well this container will be in beijing on the second of august
179661 it is always a bit exciting but this will be my seventh olympic games so i am kind of used to it
179662 so the boats should be on the venue by the 22 july

179667 you dont know when its going to run like that
179668 but when you get almost a double its probably time to lighten up
179669 still a good company that will do quite well for the rest of the year and beyond
179670 the nice thing about puts is that a little goes a long way
179671 if we are wrong and the market goes up we dont lose much but if we are right and the market goes down a lot the portfolio is protected

179676 id like to bring two more in at least were a bit light on numbers i think
179677 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
179678 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
179679 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
179680 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
179681 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
179682 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
179683 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
179684 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
179685 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
179686 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
179687 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
179688 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
179689 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
179690 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
179691 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
179692 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
179693 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
179694 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
179695 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen

179708 certain open source software business models challenge our license based software model open source commonly refers to software whose source code is subject to a license allowing it to be modified combined with other software and redistributed subject to restrictions set forth in the license a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products
179709 these open source firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software some of these firms may build upon microsoft ideas that we provide to them free or at low royalties in connection with our interoperability initiatives to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance our sales revenue and operating margins may decline
179710 another development is the business model under which companies provide content and software in the form of applications data and related services over the internet in exchange for revenues primarily from advertising or subscriptions an example of an advertising funded business model is internet search where providing a robust alternative is particularly important and challenging due to the scale effects enjoyed by a single market dominant competitor advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own competing software plus services strategies it is uncertain whether these strategies will be successful
179711 a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer vertically integrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins
179712 the linux operating system which is also derived from unix and is available without payment under a general public license has gained some acceptance as competitive pressures lead pc oems to reduce costs and new lower price pc form factors gain adoption apple takes an integrated approach to the pc experience and has made inroads in share particularly in the u s and in the consumer segment

179900 s este ano houve seis bitos mas n s queremos recompensar todos os lesados desde 2003 o tempo m dio de uma a o desse porte na justi a de dois anos na primeira inst ncia
179901 vamos pedir uma vistoria no local dependendo do resultado entraremos com uma a o pleiteando o devido aparelhamento ou a cria o de outros pontos para realiza o do procedimento
179902 keep in mind that this miscanthus is completely unimproved so if we were to do the sorts of things that weve managed to do with corn where weve increased its yield threefold over the last 50 years then its not unreal to think that we could use even less than 10 percent of the available agricultural land
179903 what weve found with miscanthus is that the amount of biomass generated each year would allow us to produce about 2 1 2 times the amount of ethanol we can produce per acre of corn
179904 it wasnt that we didnt know how to grow switchgrass because the yields we obtained were actually equal to the best yields that had been obtained elsewhere with switchgrass
179905 one reason why miscanthus yields more biomass than corn is that it produces green leaves about six weeks earlier in the growing season
179906 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
179907 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
179908 keep in mind that when we consider our energy use a few hours of solar energy falling on the earth are equal to all the energy that people use over a whole year so you dont really need that high an efficiency to be able to capture that in plant material and make use of it as a biofuel source
179909 our highest productivity is actually occurring in the south on the poorest soils in the state
179910 so that also shows us that this type of crop may be very good for marginal land or land that is not even being used for crop production
179911 in the context of global change thats important because it means that by producing a biofuel on that land youre taking carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the soil
179912 keep in mind that this miscanthus is completely unimproved so if we were to do the sorts of things that weve managed to do with corn where weve increased its yield threefold over the last 50 years then its not unreal to think that we could use even less than 10 percent of the available agricultural land
179913 and if you can actually grow it on non cropland that would be even better

179927 hab a peores y hab a mejores es un rival de nuestro nivel la eliminatoria est al cincuenta por ciento soy muy optimista hay que jugar los dos partidos 180 minutos y la ventaja de campo es importante la vuelta en casa es una ventajita que podemos tener

179930 mi llegada aqu estuvo acompa ada por muchas dr sticas irregularidades
179931 la primera irregularidad que me gustar a mencionar es que la caza de brujas medi tica que comenz en los medios musulmanes incluso antes del conflicto armado y que me proclamaron criminal de guerra e una poca en que las nicas v ctimas eran los serbios
179932 los medios internacionales continuaron esa caza de brujas de modo que es inimaginable para mucha gente que este tribunal me absuelva
179933 qu tipo de regularidad puede haber cuando todo tiene lugar en una atm sfera en la que independientemente de que la verdad pueda ser demostrada en esta sala nadie en la tierra cree en la posibilidad de mi absoluci n

179938 para nosotros es un cap tulo cerrado lo expresado desde nuestra organizaci n de iu porque entendemos que se ha procedido conforme a lo que son las pautas de relaci n entre los grupos institucionales y la organizaci n
179939 contar con la participaci n de la organizaci n en las decisiones relativas a los grupos pertenecientes a alguna instituci n p blica adem s esta tradici n se encuentra reglamentada en el caso de iulv ca en nuestros mismos estatutos
179940 en ese sentido afirmaron mart nez y g mez estaba previsto que los dos coordinadores provincial y local participaran en este proceso de remodelaci n conjuntamente con la alcaldesa y la direcci n del grupo municipal esto no ha sido as y las direcciones han sido informadas una vez tomada la decisi n
179941 era tener la m nima incidencia posible porque ya hay un equipo conformado que est desarrollando con eficacia su trabajo
179942 el trabajo tuviese la continuidad en esa eficacia y que la nueva persona que se incorporase al equipo de gobierno desde el grupo municipal de iu tuviera experiencia y fuera conocedora de la din mica municipal

179964 but i said slavery with young people european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 year old boys and bring them to the big clubs
179965 i have never mentioned that for ronaldo but the press they have distorted it
179966 i think in football there is too much modern slavery transferring players or buying players here and there and putting them somewhere and we are trying now to intervene in such cases
179967 they real madrid and manchester united will solve this problem
179968 gamesindustry biz has become an essential part of my morning routine its global viewpoint is a perfect bellwether for industry news trends and events theres nothing quite like a coffee and an exclusive scoop
179969 cristiano ronaldo is injured and anderson will be away at the olympics so we will miss them early on but apart from that the squad looks good
179970 the group has been together for a year now so we should improve and i am looking forward to seeing us do just that
179971 gary neville is back which is important and when you look at what wayne rooney has achieved at just 22 i think he could be one of the most influential players in the premier league this season
179972 i would be extremely happy if we can improve on last season although it is going to be tough
179973 chelsea have improved tottenham will be a good side so will liverpool and arsenal will be a threat even though they have lost a few players
179974 it is going to be a very exciting season in the premier league but i am sure ourselves and chelsea will be the big two
179975 you can lose a lot in three weeks and i have never found anyone who enjoys it your day pretty much consists of eat sleep and train but you have to try and build a base for the new season
179976 for a year or two at bayern we trained extremely hard
179977 but in the end we are football players and we need to be football fit that is the most important thing not running up and down with medicine balls
179978 think of the end of the empire strikes back neither side has exactly come out with what it wanted and everything has been set up for a sequel

179980 i will be a bold scottish leader my fellow scots ill focus my energies on making your hopes and your ambitions reality
179981 i will fear no one and i will do whatever it takes to deliver these promises
179982 we all know where weve been we all know things have gone wrong but from this point on its about the future we have an opportunity to work together to win again
179983 ive got great people alongside me im filled with energy for the task ahead and im raring to go
179984 i strongly believe that the scots have a right to determine their own future constitutionally
179985 i also believe that mr salmond has to act in a responsible manner when he brings forward his ideas on that because at the moment we dont have the detail we dont have any guarantee that its a neverendum
179986 i am absolutely clear in my mind that firstly we do not stand in the way of scots having their choice i do believe they will continue to choose to be part of the united kingdom
179987 but secondly there is no blank cheque for mr salmond for my support in relation to what his proposals are until i see the details of what he is saying
179988 we need to build the machine that is required to take mr salmond and his party on
179989 but he has also got his own credit crunch coming along hes got his day of reckoning as first minister hes been splashing the cash
179990 there are many issues i would want to take back to mr salmond the biggest one being he will have his day of reckoning it is coming in terms of the financing of this country
