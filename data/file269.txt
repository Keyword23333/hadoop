2690000 the first thing they wanted to do is take away the retiree medical
2690001 it could be that individual unions are losing their bargaining power
2690002 our members are feeling the brunt of the bad economy too
2690003 is the largest of the legacy airlines and will be standing when the crisis is over and the weak carriers have disappeared
2690004 the government will never permit a company the size of american to go on strike
2690005 would take corporate customers the people you really want to carry from american
2690006 has unhappy employees heavy debt and higher labor costs than most of its major competitors
2690007 the information is presented in one place at one time and it is updated dynamically
2690008 this tells us the actual status of the plane passengers and service
2690009 it helps us decide things like the order in which flights are brought back to dallas and priorities in terms of international flights and crew legalities
2690010 we restructured the company the right way weve paid our debt funded our pension plans funded obligation to creditors our employees are highest paid in the industry and our equity didnt become worthless thats what we are paid to do
2690011 however the landscape is changing we will review our strategic alternatives and make sure we remain a strong long term competitor
2690012 on long overseas flights because of its limited range even with full fuel tanks
2690013 will keep quite a few of the northwest operating people
2690014 to be a bit more careful and opportunistic about where we add our capacity
2690015 while we need to reduce costs in this difficult environment we will not be going back to our employees for pay cuts
2690016 skybus struggled to overcome the combination of rising jet fuel costs and a slowing economic environment
2690017 i have been subjected to reprisal by management and harassment by co workers
2690018 the message i have been getting is not to rock the boat
2690019 i believe there was a failure on the part of the leadership in the southwest region
2690020 if consolidation takes root either through mergers or outright capacity reductions convincing many that the overall industry is improving we expect interest in southwest from investors that do not traditionally traffic in the airline space
2690021 it has become more reliant on incremental revenue generating opportunities which could be more difficult to achieve in an economic downturn
2690022 weve slowed our growth rate in less than 12 months from 8 to what will probably be 2 in 2009
2690023 the potential for revenue lost due to no shows could easily undermine southwests low fare leadership
2690024 right now the conversation more appropriately seems to be between boeing and the federal aviation administration rather than us but nonetheless we erred on the side of safety
2690025 in 2007 boeing changed that apparently at the request of one customer that it be inspected but they say its voluntary so we found ourselves in a bit of a peculiar situation as to whether or not to submit to the faa that we think we should be inspected
2690026 our objective is to have a clear line of sight to the performance of each business unit
2690027 divesting assets that do not earn an acceptable rate of return is just as important to us as investing only where we can earn sufficient profit
2690028 united will not be taking delivery of new aircraft until we need them
2690029 our primary responsibility is the safety of our customers and our employees and there is no obligation we take more seriously
2690030 we are using our flexibility to respond quickly and decisively to todays marketplace and to manage successfully through this challenging economic cycle
2690031 consolidation will help get the industry closer to being able to compete against foreign carriers
2690032 the industry has changed dramatically both globally and domestically and the old paradigms no longer apply the current fuel and economic environment are only accelerating the need for a different approach
2690033 the path to sustainable profitability requires us to fundamentally overhaul every facet of our business
2690034 people tend to believe that theres no real value in acquiring or merging with us airways because it doesnt have any list of unique international destinations that they could tack onto their network
2690035 i see them us airways as being the least attractive partner
2690036 its my view that us airways is the least attractive of the merger candidates
2690037 virgin america also a private company may be the next casualty
2690038 i can finally fly all the way around the world on a virgin plane
2690039 it is regretful that the air line pilots association alpa is again trying to hype the media with the threat of a strike as a negotiations ploy
2690040 foreign carriers are merging to grow larger and financially stronger and u s carriers have to match that to remain competitive
2690041 you break the u s resistance and youve made a big breakthrough on a global scale
2690042 effective immediately overcrowded airports will have the flexibility to vary charges based on time of day
2690043 we will not achieve this eco efficiency or indeed survive as profitable entities if punitive taxes charges and unfair trading schemes continue on their present trajectory
2690044 add in 30 in taxes and fees and you have less than 30 per ticket to run the rest of the airline
2690045 excesses by markets bring the pendulum swinging back toward government
2690046 if you have an itinerary beyond labor day go online and make sure that flight is still there
2690047 theres no requirement that get them on the next flight or a specific flight
2690048 its a combination of rising prices and the reluctance of the u k consumer to spend money
2690049 this is the result of the more cost conscious travelers beginning to adapt their behavior to the glaringly obvious increase in what is already an expensive service relative to others and one which is discretionary for many
2690050 airtran has no unused lines of credit available and substantially all of its assets are encumbered
2690051 they really need to take out 12 to 15 of capacity
2690052 the market for selling eagle right now is probably not too good
2690053 british airways and american airlines need to complete a transatlantic deal to link operations if they are to win the fight against high fuel costs and thwart rival alliances
2690054 we will continue to take actions to increase our revenue and decrease our costs while preserving our culture and core product integrity
2690055 the entire team continues to impress me with their ability to find new ways to do things better and more efficiently helping us mitigate rising fuel costs
2690056 if you are in richards airline you are going to be close to where richard is located
2690057 now we have to combine an lcc with a premium carrier which of course works with different it and sales systems than a network carrier we will create something new that the industry had not seen before
2690058 need to see a workable plan so their investment makes sense
2690059 it appears to me that the midwest fleet is no longer needed
2690060 to make sure we have the cash level necessary to operate
2690061 we will remain true to our mission of serving major business destinations with more nonstop flights from milwaukee than any other airline
2690062 noncompliance issues within wns maintenance program to go undetected for years
2690063 has violated four different ads eight times since december 2006 including five in 2008
2690064 faa management fostered a culture whereby air carriers were considered the primary customer of its oversight mission instead of the flying public resulting in a pervasively negative although unintended impact on its oversight program
2690065 hes got to evolve the airline much more rapidly than herb ever had to because of the changing market changing costs and changing fuel prices
2690066 so you could have many more destinations being added to midway by one or two code share partners
2690067 united shares have fallen too fast and furiously implying a higher risk of near term bankruptcy than justified in our view
2690068 we need to get the job done and show up with results
2690069 without acquiring something either a full partner or significant assets the road will get harder
2690070 rather than become marginalized they could sell what theyve got and distribute the proceeds
2690071 if us airways cant find some way to grow they are probably going to contract
2690072 with neither low costs nor a global network creating an uncertain future
2690073 us airways still lacks critical mass so i wouldnt be surprised if they look at an asset acquisition
2690074 a program of intimidation to pressure your captain to reduce fuel loads
2690075 these eight pilots have routinely been above the 60 to 90 minute range it just behooves us as a company to talk to these guys figure out what theyre seeing that were not
2690076 cease your caresses unless you are ready to give me a proof that you do really and sincerely love me
2690077 give over cobbling it is a vile low trade and never yields more than ten or twelve dinars a day turn astrologer your fortune will be made and i shall have all i wish and be happy
2690078 all i know is that if you do not turn astrologer immediately i will be divorced from you to morrow
2690079 i am an astrologer i know the sun and the moon and the stars and the twelve signs of the zodiac i can calculate nativities i can foretell everything that is to happen
2690080 if you understand your art you must be able to discover the kings ruby do so and i will give you two hundred pieces of gold but if you do not succeed within six hours i will use all my influence at court to have you put to death as an impostor
2690081 o woman woman thou art more baneful to the happiness of man than the poisonous dragon of the desert
2690082 you are discovered my dear mistress you are discovered by a vile astrologer before six hours are past the whole story will be known and you will become infamous if you are even so fortunate as to escape with life unless you can find some way of prevailing on him to be merciful
2690083 spare my honour and my life and i will confess everything
2690084 oh nothing nothing with which you are not already acquainted you know too well that i stole the ruby from the kings crown i did so to punish my husband who uses me most cruelly and i thought by this means to obtain riches for myself and to have him put to death but you most wonderful man from whom nothing is hidden have discovered and defeated my wicked plan i beg only for mercy and will do whatever you command me
2690085 woman i know all thou hast done and it is fortunate for thee that thou hast come to confess thy sin and beg for mercy before it was too late return to thy house put the ruby under the pillow of the couch on which thy husband sleeps let it be laid on the side furthest from the door and be satisfied thy guilt shall never be even suspected
2690086 courage my dearest husband this is only your first labour in your new and noble profession go on and prosper and we shall become rich and happy
2690087 i am an astrologer i know the sun and the moon and the stars and the twelve signs of the zodiac i can calculate nativities i can foretell everything that is to happen
2690088 a man of your knowledge and penetration will easily discover my jewels find them and i will give you fifty pieces of gold
2690089 stay here a few moments thou great astrologer i will return immediately with the reward thou so well deservest
2690090 thou wonderful man to whom all the secrets of nature are revealed i had quite forgotten where i laid the jewels and without thee should never have found them but when thou desiredst me to look at the rent below i instantly recollected the rent near the bottom of the wall in the bathroom where before undressing i had hid them i can now go home in peace and comfort and it is all owing to thee thou wisest of men
2690091 i am going to my death the kings astrologer has heard of my presumption and is determined to have me executed as an impostor
2690092 the ways of heaven most learned and excellent ahmed are unsearchable the high are often cast down and the low are lifted up the whole world depends upon fate and fortune it is my turn now to be depressed by fate it is thine to be exalted by fortune
2690093 but who were they and what have they done with my gold and jewels
2690094 i cannot now answer but i hope to satisfy your majesty if you will grant me forty days to make my calculations
2690095 but when they are past if my treasure is not found your life shall pay the forfeit
2690096 except that i am to be put to death at the end of forty days unless i find forty chests of gold and jewels which have been stolen from the royal treasury
2690097 by the same art which discovered the ruby and the ladys necklace
2690098 foolish woman thou knowest that i have no art and that i have only pretended to it for the sake of pleasing thee but i have had sufficient skill to gain forty days during which time we may easily escape to some other city and with the money i now possess and the aid of my former occupation we may still obtain an honest livelihood
2690099 will thy cobbling thou mean spiritless wretch ever enable me to go to the hemm m like the wife of the chief astrologer i hear me ahmed think only of discovering the kings treasure thou hast just as good a chance of doing so as thou hadst of finding the ruby and the necklace and earrings at all events i am determined thou shalt not escape and shouldst thou attempt to run away i will inform the kings officers and have thee taken up and put to death even before the forty days are expired thou knowest me too well ahmed to doubt my keeping my word so take courage and endeavour to make thy fortune and to place me in that rank of life to which my beauty entitles me
2690100 your will shall be obeyed all i desire is to pass the few remaining days of my life as comfortably as i can you know i am no scholar and have little skill in reckoning so there are forty dates give me one of them every night after i have said my prayers that i may put them in a jar and by counting them may always see how many of the few days i have to live are gone
2690101 we are all found out ahmed the new astrologer has told the king that there are forty of us
2690102 this ahmed with all his simple good nature is a shrewd fellow forty chests having been stolen he naturally guessed that there must be forty thieves and he has made a good hit that is all still it is prudent to watch him for he certainly has made some strange discoveries one of us must go to night after dark to the terrace of this cobblers house and listen to his conversation with his handsome wife for he is said to be very fond of her and will no doubt tell her what success he has had in his endeavours to detect us
2690103 my dear wife to night there are two of them
2690104 the number is complete to night the whole forty are here
2690105 have patience i know what you are come for it is a very unjust and wicked deed
2690106 we are fully convinced that thou knowest why we are come nor do we mean to justify the action of which thou speakest here are two thousand pieces of gold which we will give thee provided thou wilt swear to say nothing more about the matter
2690107 do you think it possible i can suffer such gross wrong and injustice without complaining and making it known to all the world
2690108 only spare our lives and we will restore the royal treasure
2690109 guilty men ye are persuaded that ye cannot escape from my penetration which reaches unto the sun and moon and knows the position and aspect of every star in the heavens your timely repentance has saved you but ye must immediately restore all that ye have stolen go straightway and carry the forty chests exactly as ye found them and bury them a foot deep under the southern wall of the old ruined hemm m beyond the kings palace if ye do this punctually your lives are spared but if ye fail in the slightest degree destruction will fall upon you and your families
2690110 ahmed thy looks are promising hast thou discovered my treasure
2690111 does your majesty require the thieves or the treasure the stars will only grant one or the other
2690112 your majesty must make your choice i can deliver up either but not both
2690113 but if it must be so i choose the treasure
2690114 and you give the thieves a full and free pardon
2690115 if your majesty will follow me the treasure shall be restored to you
2690116 governments have got to be embarrassed into addressing the issue this is a scandal and its got to be tackled
2690117 the government encourages irrational pricing so people can fly but quite frankly not everyone should be able to afford to fly
2690118 its not good for customers for employees or for communities to have this volatility
2690119 to negotiate a eu wide comprehensive air services agreement with australia
2690120 give me back the meal take my luggage at no additional charge give me my window or aisle seat without an upcharge and increase the price of a ticket
2690121 people put up with poor service on southwest flights because they are cheap
2690122 raising prices is such a simplistic concept except for this every time it happens economy minded travelers head for southwest and other discounters
2690123 i would travel but i probably wouldnt take a second checked bag
2690124 i would try to carry on as much as i could
2690125 many travelers believe their time is not respected and it is leading them to avoid a significant number of trips
2690126 we all know people who say its a hassle its not worth it
2690127 if we increase fares in a not very good economic situation we will have a very strong impact on demand
2690128 its now a value proposition more than a price proposition
2690129 in this country we believe its written into the constitution that everyone can travel by air
2690130 consumers just wont go on vacation or will jump in a car and businesspeople will just have a phone conference instead demand is very sensitive in commercial airlines
2690131 it will probably be a more pleasant travel experience on the whole
2690132 the industry will have to behave differently in terms of customer service
2690133 elite fliers of the pre deregulation days wont be back and theres always going to be a deal out there somewhere but not for anyone who wants travel at peak times
2690134 as capacity cutbacks happen there will be fewer seats available and any people whose flights are delayed wont be moved through the system very quickly
2690135 consumers should be wary and be prepared for longer delays and the possibility of being stranded
2690136 it was surprising to learn that customers are less concerned about paying higher fees than about what they see as a decline in the quality of customer service customers are saying that if theyre treated badly by an airline theyll vote with their feet
2690137 in this unstable industry environment it is critical that airlines invest in their employees as a means to enhance the customer experience as there is a strong connection between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction
2690138 if you see a good price its where you want to go a price you can afford then dont wait around chances are there arent going to be many seats at that low price
2690139 half of us know where we want to be for thanksgiving yet most of us wait if you know right now book now
2690140 sit down put on your seat belt and shut up
2690141 on an american carrier you are so afraid to ask for something extra
2690142 routes we might have gone into in a 50 or 60 per barrel of oil environment dont hold up at 100
2690143 flies under the price umbrella of delta with a lower cost structure
2690144 weve made a decision to basically stop all growth for this year and well into next
2690145 theyve put a strong emphasis on people and processes and it shows
2690146 reduce capacity in an effort to significantly reduce costs and create a more sustainable supply and demand balance in the market
2690147 our pilot cost per block hour which is already the industrys highest would increase more than 150 percent placing aa at a crippling disadvantage compared to our competitors
2690148 however any changes that benefit our pilots must be linked to increases in efficiency and productivity so that we can strengthen our company and be better equipped to compete and succeed in our rapidly changing industry
2690149 in these mediated negotiations it is critical that we engage in a process that produces economically viable proposals and stimulates honest conversations
2690150 while the reductions will vary by department they will generally be in line with the capacity reduction of approximately 8 percent from the 2008 plan
2690151 these are for senior pilots who already are eligible to retire
2690152 it is a way for them to retire a little earlier than they might have otherwise with a little extra cash
2690153 one of the lowest cost structures in the industry and strongest balance sheets in the industry
2690154 while its important to maintain a broad domestic presence for our customers and employees as well as to feed international routes we remain flexible and will make additional adjustments if needed
2690155 to an emphasis on margin and ebitdar by pruning slowly developing new markets and raising fares more aggressively than the market
2690156 to make sure we have the cash level necessary to operate
2690157 in the current environment capacity has to come out of the industry
2690158 that comes from retiring planes in the fleet and not taking delivery of new planes
2690159 achieving a joint contract and combined seniority list in advance of the closing of the merger is something that has never been done in this industry
2690160 we cant become addicted to this cost advantage that weve built up
2690161 we need to continue to manage other costs the way we always have
2690162 at this time we are not thinking seriously about an acquisition
2690163 our goal is to make a 15 annual return on invested capital each year
2690164 we have a wonderful advantage where fees dont fly with southwest
2690165 to say i am disappointed would be an understatement we are devastated
2690166 likely to be significantly higher six to 12 months from now
2690167 a significant step leading to a more effective and efficient operating fleet for united in the years ahead while improving our customer experience and reliability
2690168 the magnitude of the challenge the industry faces demands unprecedented change
2690169 were confident united has the ability and resources to go it alone
2690170 frequency reductions while retaining a commitment to all five u s hubs
2690171 all told we expect that merchandising opportunities will generate 1 billion in revenue annually over the next few years
2690172 we need to pull every lever that is available to us be it capacity discipline fare increases fuel surcharges ancillary revenue generation or something as basic as returning pricing segmentation to the marketplace
2690173 with record breaking fuel prices we must pursue new revenue opportunities while continuing to offer competitive fares by tailoring our products and services around what our customers value most and are willing to pay for
2690174 zoroaster established a criterion other than usefulness to determine whether a power was good or bad by making an ethical distinction between the spirits
2690175 spirit only and withal the spirit of truth purity and justice
2690176 among the beings opposed to ormuzd a conspicuous place is taken by the dragon azhi dahaka whose home is in bapel babylon a druj half human half beast with three heads this dragon creates drouth and disease
2690177 ignorant folk at the beginning of an eclipse throw themselves on their knees and beat gongs and drums to frighten away the hungry devil
2690178 having on one occasion failed to do so and having received a reprimand he proceeded with the prayer that he might become a destructive dragon
2690179 fiendish snake three jawed and triple headed six eyed of thousand powers and of mighty strength a lie demon of the daevas evil for our settlements and wicked whom the evil spirit angra mainyu made
2690180 he appears still in that character in yasti xix seq where he is described struggling against atar fire in the sea vourukasha his contest with yima khshaeta bore at first the same mythological character the shining yima being originally like the vedic yima a solar hero when yima was turned into an earthly king azhi underwent the same fate
2690181 fire is everywhere the deadly foe of these fiendish serpents which are water spirits they are ever powerless against the sun as was azhi lacking wit against ormuzd
2690182 tradition adds another guardian to the precious deposit a dragon or winged serpent this sits forever brooding over the treasures which it cannot enjoy greedy of gold like those famous griffins that contended with the ancient arimaspians
2690183 it was eighty yards in length and so fierce that neither elephant nor demon nor lion ever ventured to pass by its lair
2690184 almost tore up the earth with its heels to rouse his sleeping master
2690185 without a confirmed faa administrator safety and modernization projects will be left to the whims of a rudderless federal bureaucracy it is beyond me why anyone in the senate would want to hold up filling this vital leadership role
2690186 this is a business world where corporations have to boost profits
2690187 what we dont want is an unregulated monopoly on a regional basis
2690188 ba and virgin are very much at the top end of the market the americans are at the low end and that is the way they are perceived by customers
2690189 parents want their children to experience a different culture and learn first hand what the world is like
2690190 unfortunately for travelers in 2008 this increasewill probably be the first in a continued wave of increases
2690191 its frustrating to report a fourth quarter adjusted loss in what has been a solid year relative to other carriers
2690192 we need a union president who is willing and has the ability to take on american executives when necessary and fight for the flight attendants who are out there on the planes every day
2690193 things are going to be very different the whole tone is going to change particularly with contract negotiations and its going to be more intense
2690194 its obvious that the membership wants the return of our previous salaries and then some
2690195 flight attendants are broke and tired and hungry and angry and just despondent
2690196 we need someone who will unify us and fight for us
2690197 our positive earnings and cash flow allowed us to pay down a significant amount of debt
2690198 the outstanding performance of our team has once again set us apart from the competition
2690199 delta has comfort with northwest and a transaction with northwest would be easier to do
2690200 a deal with united could be both riskier but a more exciting transaction the atlanta based unit of the air line pilots association opened its strike operations center and mobilized its tactical arm the strike preparedness committee pinnacle this summer will replace atlantic southeast airlines as the delta connection carrier operating the atlanta cozumel route delta dal was considering a merger with northwest nwa or united uaua delta plans to cancel the equivalent of 10 domestic mainline aircraft and 35 regional jets by grounding planes and using them less this year delta has taken on two more boeing 757s bringing its fleet total to 15 aircraft the aircraft which came from american airlines fleet delta and united united is a larger carrier and arguably the better known brand northwest is smaller than delta so its more likely that delta would be the surviving brand and the headquarters would stay in atlanta air franceklm also could provide strategic or financial backing in a delta bid for northwest if delta were to strike a deal with united and defect from skyteam the move would be a double blow to air franceklm delta exited first in april 2007 its shares have dropped 34 since and carry a fpe ratio of 14 4 the carrier sees negative operating margins in the first quarter the company took 13 domestic aircraft out of its fleet in the fourth quarter and this month plans to cancel the equivalent of another 10 domestic mainline aircraft delta sees a first quarter operating margin of negative 2 to 4 with domestic mainline capacity falling 3 to 4 in the quarter frontier frontier airlines has developed a strong brand frontier has made some big moves in recent weeks including layoffs and a realignment of its route network the company is considering partnering with international airlines and u s low cost carriers shedding some planes further tweaking its route network and possibly shifting to a pricing structure in which passengers pay extra for some services and amenities efforts to revive frontier financially for me the biggest priorities are focusing on the bottom line and on profitability we have to stabilize the airline
2690201 the rise in fuel costs forced frontier which hasnt posted an annual profit in nearly four years
2690202 i think we needed to narrow down the priorities when you have 100 different things going on its hard to do them well
2690203 for us to compete we either have to go out and buy a bunch of new airplanes or we can develop relationships that will deliver that in a different way
2690204 its becoming more important now to determine how we get more money out of the product were offering
2690205 he will have to decide whether he wants a warm and fuzzy company or a lean and mean company that can survive in hard times
2690206 im a true believer in the culture here but theres a question in the marketplace of the longevity of this company
2690207 i want people to have jobs but if we dont make these tough decisions then we dont have a company
2690208 neither really has much choice but to roll back later today in order to stay competitive
2690209 southwest airlines is concerned about slowing economic growth and we want our flight schedule to be built around flights that are in high demand
2690210 more use of off peak times will make for a more efficient operation
2690211 united may blame this weeks flight cancellations on poor weather in the midwest
2690212 but as most of our competitors demonstrated the real culprit was uniteds lack of manpower
2690213 we worked late into the evenings both days to get customers to their destinations
2690214 when you extend the amount of time we had people working those days we knew wed have to cancel flights the subsequent days
2690215 management team that is bent on personal profit over customer service
2690216 uniteds pilots pin delays on top bosses union advertises take on latest trouble
2690217 it was a tough winter weather month for all the industry
2690218 this was the worst december in history weather wise for united
2690219 it was a tough winter weather month for all the industry
2690220 we believe ual remains as highly leveraged as ever to even the slightest fluctuations in demand for air travel
2690221 somewhere in the process the industry has lost sight of the fact that marginal costs dont stay marginal and marginal revenues can be destructive to core revenue performance
2690222 earlier this year we knew we had to reverse the domestic drag
2690223 driven by our continued discipline in managing capacity aggressively controlling inventory to improve revenue results we delivered industry leading passenger revenue performance
2690224 our position has always been that we control our decisions no one makes them for us
2690225 the advantage of our situation is that we have the choices that we continue to consider with our board
2690226 a consolidated u s carrier would be better able to compete in the international market
2690227 wed like to transparently present to the market its true value
2690228 we have none on order but thats something were looking at
2690229 should further adjustments be required you know that we will act decisively
2690230 a consolidated u s carrier would be far better prepared to compete in that environment
2690231 you can assume that absolutely everything goes into the mix of consideration
2690232 we have none on order but thats something were looking at
2690233 i think the thing that stands out the most is the amazing prasm passenger revenue per available seat mile increase
2690234 they looked like they were in a little bit stronger position than we though they would be
2690235 being the sixth of the big six were not going to be somebodys first choice
2690236 us airways is probably at some risk of being marginalized
2690237 us airways could also join the crowd and seek to acquire northwest
2690238 we have been and continue to be focused on single contracts for all of our represented labor groups and will continue to negotiate in the proper forums with them to that end
2690239 virgin atlantic is committed to resolving this dispute but the only way our cabin crew are going to see any form of pay increase in future is by joining the hundreds of volunteers coming in to work on the planned strike days and ensuring that our customers get to their destinations
2690240 i believe that the union are hearing loud and clear from their members that they will be far worse off unless they come in to work
2690241 for some of you more pay than virgin atlantic can afford may be critical to your lifestyle and if that is the case you should consider working elsewhere
2690242 they are trying to play catch up the americans have never been able to match us on innovation and new products it will be many many years before they catch up
2690243 it is absolutely the wrong time for the company to continue ramping up the branded flying strategy
2690244 it is what liberalization was intended to do i think it is inevitable that the increase in the number of players will see a downward pressure on fares
2690245 our strategy is to identify the highest risk products and then insist that everything is certified by someone we trust
2690246 its time for president bush to nominate an administrator who solves transportation problems rather than creating more of them
2690247 instead we got the same old stale proposals the same neglect of our nations infrastructure needs
2690248 i doubt that theres an airport operator or airport executive in the country that would agree with that
2690249 it is pretty hard to believe the administration is serious about increasing capacity when they again cut airport improvement program funding by nearly 22 percent
2690250 once again the bush administration wants huge new taxes and user fees imposed on general aviation and it wants to slash and burn the airport improvement program
2690251 has made coming to work optional for too many employees
2690252 the slower growth for passenger demand in december sets the trend for the coming months
2690253 people traveling on our flights have said it is important that they keep in touch with the office friends and family
2690254 we work with the authorities and we have the highest levels of security and respect them
2690255 i do like being able to go to the front of the line
2690256 other airlines seem to be ceaselessly trying to part money from me without providing service
2690257 of our entire february schedule we will cancel one tenth of 1 percent of the entire schedule
2690258 we are pleased that the apa today responded to americans previous requests for a protocol agreement
2690259 in binding arbitration you are placing your fate completely in the hands of a third party
2690260 we want to ensure that we have the time to be thoughtful and deliberate about the issues
2690261 americans history as far as mergers and acquisitions are concerned is not a good one
2690262 american airlines after investigation has determined that oxygen was administered on the aircraft and it was working and the defibrillator was applied as well
2690263 its been five years since we made those significant concessions and the cost of living has gone up
2690264 we can recover all those things and make significant gains
2690265 when compared to peers are very strong and reflect the success of our restructuring
2690266 would not move forward with any transaction that did not serve the interests of our employees our shareholders our customers and the communities we serve
2690267 i have to question the sanity of any airline where if you have a problem you cant call them
2690268 we have changed and the environment we are in has changed
2690269 we believe calmer labor relations remove a headwind on uals potential involvement in industry consolidation
2690270 the pilots at united are done doing anything that is at their discretion sorry but look for the bare minimum from the employees at united airlines until further notice
2690271 but i hear the pilots calm voice telling atc that were experiencing continuous light chop and i can relax more
2690272 the last link with a world i enjoyed very much
2690273 united airlines will not merge with another carrier unless we say it will merge
2690274 the only way they pay attention is if were acting up
2690275 acting up can mean any number of things and thats as far as im going to go
2690276 when you cant rely as much on market stimulation and have to steal share from other airlines you have to be relevant to business travelers
2690277 were going to approach this faa reauthorization to try to direct attention to some of the issues we read about every day 3 000 flights being canceled airlines flying with improper equipment
2690278 it makes no sense that consolidation is limited to domestic partners
2690279 carriers have no authority or legal property interest in the slots
2690280 attempt to take away that property would require due process and just compensation
2690281 if consumers start to push back the airlines will be smart and continue to lean as much as possible on the business traveler side
2690282 if fuel prices remain as is the financial impact on the airline industry is expected to rival that of 9 11
2690283 increasingly passengers are certain that the airlines are not on their side and actually dont care anything about them
2690284 passenger satisfaction is dismal and things probably wont get any better if airlines continue to charge more for less
2690285 because it was a grim possibility it takes us all by surprise
2690286 the employees arent going to go back and gut the contract again that was a one time deal
2690287 is bankruptcy inevitable no but you cant ignore the fact that american has some significant obligations coming due that cant be ignored
2690288 we wanted to preserve jobs keep our work in house and protect retirement and healthcare
2690289 so we were looking to make adjustments anywhere else we could
2690290 when you look at the industry and our competitors and where our employees stand theyre in a much better position than their counterparts
2690291 amr is the only carrier at this point that may need to renegotiate its loan covenants this year a step already taken by ual and northwest
2690292 in addition americans labor costs are the highest in the industry
2690293 the recommendation from international was to let the members decide because of the uncertainty of the industry
2690294 the airline industry as it is constituted today was not built to withstand oil prices at 125 a barrel and certainly not when record fuel expenses are coupled with a weak u s economy
2690295 our company and industry simply cannot afford to sit by hoping for industry and market conditions to improve
2690296 must find ways to cover the cost of providing our services so that we can remain viable and have the resources to reinvest in our company for the future
2690297 as well as create a more sustainable supply and demand balance
2690298 the bottom line is that our revenues which include ticket sales and fees must keep pace with our increasing costs
2690299 would be placed at risk in a merger with another carrier in todays environment
2690300 it was horrible it was unexpected it was really without warning
2690301 in order to start los angeles service without losing money we would have had to raise the fares beyond what we believe customers would have been willing to pay
2690302 this amendment gives us the flexibility to implement the significant actions we are taking to combat higher fuel costs including reducing capacity creating new streams of revenue and lowering our costs
2690303 the united guys are very much heading in the direction of something that will really allow them to downsize the airline
2690304 there is no large financial benefit that we are not receiving because we dont have one integrated pilot contract right now or one seniority list
2690305 were optimistic that economic conditions will be on the upswing in 2010 giving us a better chance of success with our first route to china
2690306 every u s carrier including continental is under enormous pressure from record high fuel prices a slowing u s economy and a weak dollar
2690307 espero que el meu or obri la porta a molts m s per a lesport espanyol
2690308 un combat s una lluita guanyes o perds res m s
2690309 for the herald amp review those first few spring days in the
2690310 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2690311 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2690312 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2690313 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2690314 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2690315 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2690316 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2690317 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2690318 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2690319 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2690320 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2690321 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2690322 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2690323 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2690324 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2690325 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2690326 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2690327 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2690328 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving
2690329 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k

2690333 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2690334 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2690335 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2690336 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
2690337 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent

2690342 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2690343 even now i can retrace the first steps i took as a child and be stunned by the beauty of the islands the trembling blue plane of the pacific the moss coloured cliffs the north shores thunderous waves
2690344 he said he was above having to answer that question
2690345 that wrinkly white haired guy the oldest celebrity in the world
2690346 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its easy to lose confidence
2690347 its john mccain who wears 500 italian shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state its barack obama that climbed up the hard way
2690348 its funny to have anybody characterise barack as an elitist
2690349 you know this kid who was raised by a single mother has walked away his entire life from lucrative careers to work in the community
2690350 as you may know not long ago a couple of hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2690351 i voted for obama so now im free of racial guilt
2690352 wir haben unsere klasse auch gegen ber kapfenberg gezeigt und sehr routiniert gespielt nicht nur ich sondern auch die ganze mannschaft war eine klasse f r sich
2690353 der verdienteste sieg den ich jemals in der bundesliga erleben durfte
2690354 wir m ssen schneller werden auf dem spielfeld und im kopf das tempo in der bundesliga ist f r uns derzeit noch zu hoch
2690355 die n chsten gegner sind unsere kragenweite da werden wir zeigen dass wir kein kanonenfutter sind
2690356 das ist wie wenn man bei rot ber die ampel f hrt da muss man auch einmal zahlen das n chste mal ist er aber wieder kapit n
2690357 es ist nicht der letzte glaube da wie er im pappelstadion da ist
2690358 aber so sind die dinge wenn ich hingehe und den ball reinhauen will dann ist er drin wenn ich ihn irgendwie reinbringen will dann geht er eben nicht rein
2690359 non puoi parlare damore senza immagini funebri forse che pi di amare tu desideri di morire
2690360 he clearly wanted to subvert the messages conveyed by hans andersens tales but more important his poetical style recalled the rhythms and language of the bible in order to counter the stringent christian code
2690361 its gone mental down here with britains bronze medal match against france only five minutes away the biggest storm ive ever seen rain is coming in sideways in bucket sized lumps and everyone is trying to hide under desks as the lightning crashes down overhead
2690362 the british girls are in a good position and are riding to plan everyone is all together and it is all to play for it does not really matter how it pans out we have good climbers and a good finisher in nicole cooke
2690363 it looks like theyve got a little bit more in hand which is good to see
2690364 problem with british sport is there is no bottle all this taking part that counts rubbish dont see the aussies happy with coming third like we are
2690365 hard luck for the british trio in a hugely intimidating atmosphere at the archery field with thunder rumbling overhead and the wind gusting all over the place the chinese trio were simply too strong the stands are packed half with south korean fans half with china fans the way its going britain will be facing france in the bronze medal match
2690366 weve just spoken to niemeyer see 0851 entry he says he pulled out of the singles because he has a sore elbow and he wants to compete in the doubles tonight so he will play against the murrays but he wont be fully fit
2690367 were investigating whether theres been a stroke of good fortune for andy and jamie murray they were due to face daniel nestor and frederic niemeyer from canada in the doubles but niemeyer retired from the singles competition a few minutes ago if he pulls out of the doubles there will be a last minute entry to replace the pair which has to be good news for the murrays who did have a difficult draw
2690368 if you look at the pedigree of the opponent a world championship bronze medallist thats the way to judge the measure of billy joe saunders performance saunders has been criticised for not starting well enough early enough but hes learned very quickly and seems determined to make his mark
2690369 qualifying at the gymnastics is over for the moment beth tweddle is seventh on the floor with two more sessions to come so it looks unlikely shell qualify although things look slightly better in the bars in the all around though becky downie lies 14th the top 24 go through and she has the best chance
2690370 were not seeing too much of nicole cooke at the moment and thats pretty good news shes tucked in the middle of the field freewheeling along
2690371 ireland light welterweight johnny joyce has got a medal chance but hes up against a decent opener in gyula kate bradley saunders is boxing in the evening session today and he too is a medal contender
2690372 beth tweddles score of 15 65 puts her fourth in the bars at the moment the top eight go through you would have thought that would be enough for beth but she did look a bit disappointed and lost some shape on the one handed pirouette
2690373 re 0535 sleep is overrated like low fat yoghurt and pete dohertys music
2690374 i cant decide if i should sleep or not anyone want to make a decision for me
2690375 alison williamson used to teach at a school down the road from me in shropshire
2690376 its amazing to be with these three girls its nice to be in my first olympics final
2690377 it was great to see michael phelps being pushed even though it seemed like he was in a race of his own at the end
2690378 im pretty emotional after that race i wanted to go for the record but i wasnt sure if i should in the warm up room i kind of got these chills in my body and starting getting excited

2690390 ular tersebut mungkin mengalami seleksi alam sehingga hanya yang kecil yang bertahan
2690391 fakta bahwa ular tersebut menghasilkan satu telur raksasa relatif terhadap ukuran induknya menunjukkan bahwa seleksi alam mencoba menjaga ukuran keturunan di atas batas kritis untuk bertahan hidup
2690392 im reminding myself that other people are up at this time
2690393 if you or your family have no urgent need to remain in georgia you should leave as soon as possible
2690394 it is wise to do so while some air services are still available and the border remains open
2690395 if you or your family have no urgent need to remain in georgia you should leave as soon as possible
2690396 it is wise to do so while some air services are still available and the border remains open

2690402 she went back to new york and basically told all her colleagues that she would not ever try out another show again anywhere except at the 5th avenue theatre in seattle because it was such a great experience all around
2690403 we get about a call a month from a producer or a creator of one of these new broadway bound projects
2690404 we were looking for a sophisticated and smart audience that was used to evaluating new work
2690405 the arts are celebrated and supported here and it just felt like the right type of audience to put our show up
2690406 it requires special effects i do know that theyre using some new technology in the show that has never been tried in theater before
2690407 the challenge of mounting shrek is that we have to come up with theatrical solutions for what people saw in the film
2690408 im 6 ft 2 i will be 41 2 ft tall
2690409 when you see me you wont believe your eyes i would say its the best reveal of a character that i have gotten to do
2690410 you will see a live character rather than somebody dressed in a costume
2690411 these characters will be breathing living creatures and you will buy it
2690412 you will see the characters as they are with all their attitudes idiosyncrasies and their bad habits
2690413 you really do have to pay attention to what is happening around you all the time
2690414 once youre up and running you anticipate when theres going to be something moving on stage
2690415 they gasped then it was ohmigosh they were so excited
2690416 i think adults will love coming and seeing it with their children
2690417 our shrek is a brand new musical with all new songs
2690418 we specifically wanted people to work on the show who were born and bred theater people and bring them into the process to make sure that what we ended up with was something for the theater
2690419 people feel like they can do their work here without being in the bubble of attention
2690420 we are telling more of the stories than are in the film
2690421 because the movie is 80 minutes long and the show will be north of two hours long we can dig more into the characters and learn where they came from
2690422 how did shrek get into the swamp how did fiona get into the tower were going to answer those questions for the audience
2690423 john picks me up so i know he can pick you guys up
2690424 but youve been growing it for so long to be hippy like
2690425 it only takes one hair cut for it to be a chelsy cut
2690426 orignal nature of mankind successive thoughts do not stop prior thoughts present thoughts and future thoughts follow one after the other without cessation
2690427 if one instant of thought is cut off the dharma body separates from the physical body you become separated from reality and fall into delusion
2690428 in the midst of successive thoughts do not abide in any dharma thing whatsoever if in one instant of thought you cling then in all successive thoughts you will also cling this is known as being fettered
2690429 but if in all successive thoughts you do not cling then you are unfettered therefore non abiding is made the basis of my teaching
2690430 there is nothing that will teach us but the yearning of what will soon be gone and how we let it go because of morals or ethics because of professors or peers nothing but the seconds of each night of each star falling across the sky all we have is a night of eternal possibility or damnation

2690442 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2690443 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so

2690473 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2690474 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2690475 with the slates wiped clean for team finals the americans arent in a mathematical hole
2690476 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2690477 johnson promised china won the first subdivision although most of the passion came from the audience
2690478 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2690479 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2690480 i saw how parthiv was hit on his nose during the third and final test against sri lanka it was surprising to see him without a helmet maybe he was confident but parthiv was fortunate to have hit on the nose
2690481 the ball came off the pad and him hard but my injury was very serious im glad that parthiv could come and keep again he needs to put on some ice and he would be fine
2690482 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot

2690525 this is the way drugs will be designed in the future
2690526 we are working with the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries to evaluate these chips

2690528 virtually every major medical advance in the past century has involve animal models at least in part

2690531 the consumer is taking the mindset that if i dont need it today then i am not going to buy it
2690532 sometimes those feelings would last all week until the next weigh in which would either confirm the feeling or change it
2690533 the percentages of people willing to make extreme sacrifices were much lower
2690534 but what struck me was apt how big our sample size was there s still a significant number of people who would give up a lot in order not to be obese
2690535 individuals more strongly associated fat people with bad and thin people with good
2690536 children are constantly given the message you re fat because you re lazy
2690537 i think people do try but it s extremely difficult to lose weight and keep it off
2690538 part of the problem is we view obesity as something that s under the person s control and we blame the individual for having the problem
2690539 but i credit people overestimate how much control we have over our body s shape and weight
2690540 for there to be a change we have to stop blaming the individual
2690541 we ve been blaming people for a long time and it s not working
2690542 i just don t think yelling more at people is going to get us anywhere

2690566 my team members were a little nervous and some players lost the opportunity to score
2690567 therefore we have to resolve the problem in the shooting circle so that we convert opportunities
2690568 the main issue is how to make the best of the opportunities within the shooting circle many of them got the opportunity we also have to make sure that the senior players are kept fresh
2690569 government should place few if any restrictions on scientific research and development
2690570 go before the american people and try to defend the status quo and then bear witness to the peoples appetite for dramatic change
2690571 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2690572 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2690573 i hope to contribute to a new political environment in this country that will allow the next president to do what i think the next president is going to think is the right thing to do
2690574 the ordinance specifically cited girl scouts among others as nonprofit organizations that would need to apply for a permit if they go door to door
2690575 according to staff writer david pierson the incident began when taylor demanded the scouts who had set up a cookie sale at a street corner a few feet from taylors husbands law office at indian hill boulevard and second street to move elsewhere
2690576 but there were a few problems with the article the most minor of which being it contained numerous factual errors
2690577 they immediately made you feel so at ease as it if was your home too
2690578 we were selling the bachmans on ucla but they truly wanted to get to know us
2690579 you knew 30 40 minutes before the game they would be there smiling and cheering
2690580 the first thing she would do is apologize to the player for hitting somebody
2690581 and it wasnt sarcastic it was a genuine remark a reflection of wizs parents
2690582 they had just as much fun watching wiz play volleyball as wiz had playing volleyball
2690583 she was so happy that her parents were going to be there and she was going to get to spend some time with them
2690584 i want to stop everything right now and find the recipe for the bachman bars
2690585 hes a well polished opponent and i beat him by more than 10 points
2690586 its going to be tough all the way but ill stick it out
2690587 im in a tough draw but ill battle it out and do the best i can
2690588 it was a mature performance from the youngest member of our team a tremendous performance
2690589 we made a point of making sure things were as routine as possible for a game day

2690594 i was very intrigued with the idea of doing a character based drama set in los angeles that revolved around explosive moments in peoples lives that came out of seemingly mundane events
2690595 but we are a family and well get through this together
2690596 he doesnt know when or if hell be able to return to the team
2690597 it also has a very avid and verbal fan following that extols everything about the program
2690598 the feedback was tremendous from them overwhelmingly positive and it actually led to a very successful upfront for nbc
2690599 that was all very much fun and nice but whats going to happen later on this year when leno goes to abc and kicks conans ass
2690600 but we really believe in the decisions weve made with our partners including jay and well really be standing by them because we love the talent we have on nbc and we love the franchise that we have on nbc and we think theres opportunity for a lot of great talent to play
2690601 when we made the deal with jay four years ago we made a long term deal with him
2690602 weve been talking to him for pretty much that whole time about the future beyond the tonight show we cant force him to do something were presenting him with a number of opportunities that we think would be great were hoping he eventually thinks that theyll be as great as well
2690603 but the star of the show is the car so that was a case where it felt like low hanging fruit to bring in an automotive partner on a certain level because you know theyre going to be part of that show no matter how you look at it
2690604 i thought it was pretty cool they were playing prince of persia since fanboys used to speculate that if there as a movie made that actress who plays reese here would make a great farah the princess in that game

2690636 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2690637 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2690638 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2690639 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2690640 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2690641 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2690642 het spijt me mevrouw maar u mag hier niet zwemmen in een tweedelig badpak
2690643 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2690644 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2690645 with all the problems we have to face here in jamaica internally and within the international frame of relations of production we are lambasted for being homophobic we get bad mouthed in the international press and we are misunderstood we are still number one in the world per capita in sports no one can touch us
2690646 so the olympics now shows them how powerful and not just powerful but positively powerful and enviable we are
2690647 in fact of all the international sporting competitions the olympics is the only one that stops wars we should have 10 olympics
2690648 with 2 7 million people we cant even be seen on the global map but we actually have no comparison per capita when it comes to track and field
2690649 so with all the negative things that are happening we have this its our glory not us being bad and violent and hating gays
2690650 you can attempt to quantify the financial value in many ways but certainly you cannot quantify the value in terms of jamaicas exposure to billions of people for a period in excess of the days of our games and jamaica gets extremely positive exposure right throughout
2690651 we also have the exposure that comes from the opening ceremony where because of the high profile of the athletes we have the international media will be paying attention to jamaica more than ever
2690652 i dont know who would want to put a value on that
2690653 those not connected to sports had better understand that sports is by far the leading thing projecting positiveness on jamaica this is how the whole country benefits whether you are in sports tourism manufacturing or just the ordinary citizen in jamaica
2690654 i think that the country at large benefits and has benefited over the years from all the persons who have represented the country throughout the years at an olympic games
2690655 we have established ourselves in stature sports and music and also most anywhere you go in the world they people can call the name of jamaica it has greater value than even the airfare going to the olympics the returns are very high even if jamaica gets four medals when you look at the number of countries participating in the olympic games and the number of countries that get medals we are dwarfs walking into a country of giants but we stand very tall
2690656 we are part of an international community and this event is the most important sports event in the world and we have athletes who have qualified
2690657 but in addition to that we have a long list of athletes who are at the top of the performance ladder
2690658 if you are at this level you cannot go without the support systems for your athletes competing on the international scene is very complicated and it is a precise set of arrangements that need to be in place
2690659 and if you dont have coaches and physiotherapists your masseurs your team managers who have to attend meetings and ensure that everything is in place for competition it will be totally impossible
2690660 the ioc and the respective international federations in recognition of the support system that is essential have an overall estimate that the support numbers will be about 50 per cent of the athletes numbers
2690661 cycling for example is one on one you cannot send a cyclist without a coach and support methods
2690662 no one wanted to see india out of the olympics but the reality is that the best 12 nations have qualified for beijing
2690663 the hockey world will obviously miss india but im confident they will comeback stronger and ready to take on the world again

2690670 there has been a lot of comment today regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2690671 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player
2690672 the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2690673 but the closer we get to school starting the closer we get to football and getting to see friends
2690674 we had about 80 walk ins the past week and all are new kids that we have no history on

2690681 like most other california harbors our fish landings have been declining greatly over the past 10 years
2690682 keeping montereys culture and history of fishing is a big challenge it is also related to our successful tourism economy as we know people come here to see this and eat fresh local seafood
2690683 about 80 percent of that is put back into the local economy in the form of salaries to employees and to businesses for supplies and equipment
2690684 the harbor supports everything from personal kayaks to 90 foot yachts the harbors challenges include the regulatory and fiscal challenges in keeping the entrance and north harbor clear of sand and sediment and supporting a declining and increasingly regulated fishing industry
2690685 including the largest raft of sea otters on the central coast and kayaking in the elkhorn slough estuarine research reserve
2690686 the single most challenging issue facing our harbor is regulatory action proposed pending and existing it is critical that we maintain our fishing heritage but as you see commercial fishing vessels become fewer and fewer take photos because they are being regulated out of existence

2690703 early in the week some guys are different than when we get pads on
2690704 youre hoping for certain things to happen when the pads are on you hope for some guys to have changed some of them do and some of them dont
2690705 you come through summertime and some their bodies change and they become more physical and grow up and some guys when the pads come on and as they say the dogs start barking some of them go back in the house
2690706 some guys stay outside and some guys stay in the house
2690707 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2690708 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2690709 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible

2690724 these allegations involve individuals in a complex arrangement involving shell companies kickbacks bogus contracts with the people committing fraud and hospitals covering up kickbacks
2690725 you see people coming in here and they try things on but you see that hesitancy
2690726 they walk out without buying it theyre not ready to make that impulse buy because theyre afraid of whats going to happen in the future
2690727 now no sale is good enough no price is low enough
2690728 its been a boatload of money to put it colloquially
2690729 the public needs to appreciate how seriously we took the 70 percent vote for jessicas law and public safety
2690730 was it like a crisis yes anybody who was willing to take on evaluations at any time and in any place could literally work around the clock
2690731 they were just saying take them take them take them

2690742 ive watched kayaks flip over ive seen people just ram docks our dock almost got taken off the other week i thought the whole thing was just going to snap off
2690743 we rounded the corner of a dune and all of a sudden the beach that had been there yesterday it was gone
2690744 all there was instead was roaring white surf pouring into edgartown harbor
2690745 look at him you could water ski behind that sucker
2690746 its not the quiet peaceful little harbor that it once was
2690747 that and the possibility of sharks is kind of an eye opener at the beach
2690748 he wasnt a doctrinaire conservative republican who didnt have compassion for groups of people who didnt have it made
2690749 there was a perception i had from the beginning that he did not relate to or get involved with us
2690750 im a lifetime member of the naacp here in phoenix and ive never seen him come around
2690751 im not particularly proud of my record with african americans mainly because im a senator from a state where the african american population is small
2690752 the episcopal high school class of 1954 was all male and all white
2690753 theres a standard mantra of race neutrality in the military a lot of people say when you wear the uniform its either green or light green not black and white
2690754 everybody told him dont do it because no one cares except the tribes and they are generally democrats and are probably going to be upset with whatever you do
2690755 after he heard that about 10 times he said im going to do it
2690756 he worked the navajo nation its a thing other statewide elected officials failed to do
2690757 on some poor reservations where the hollywood glamour drugs like cocaine do not exist some indian youth resort to using inhalants like gasoline sterno and even household items such as lysol spray
2690758 the town was only 5 000 people and maybe 700 votes but he would come by
2690759 he always struck me as a guy who would reach out
2690760 beginning in the 80s mccain began to see opportunities reaching out to the ministers of the gospel and say what can i do for you
2690761 said c t wright an arizona republican who once served as president of cheyney university of pennsylvania the countrys oldest historically black college
2690762 he helped bridge the gap that we republicans have with the black community and aided me in establishing an effective dialogue which transcends notions of party and race
2690763 at the time there werent a lot of big issues involving the african american community except to say that when the martin luther king issue came up i was on the wrong side of it
2690764 as we are embarking on a national policy of energy conservation i feel the costs are prohibitive
2690765 i dont think he appreciated fully how big of a positive impact it would make and he does now
2690766 when he became a senator he began to represent the state rather than the district and those contacts were few then i didnt see him that much in the community
2690767 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2690768 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2690769 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2690770 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2690771 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2690772 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2690773 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2690774 laura and i were also saddened by the attack on an american family and their chinese tour guide today in beijing
2690775 the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2690776 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible were banding together as a team to lift up the bachmans and mccutcheons we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2690777 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2690778 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2690779 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2690780 we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goose bumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2690781 appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics
2690782 no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2690783 its far too early to suggest that this has anything to do with the olympics
2690784 i get off the plane in hawaii today and the world is saying my management team said blah blah blah siiiiiiggghhhh i told the media you cant make up lies about me because i have a media outlet myself oh and sidebar i dont know if everyone has realized this yet but i dont do interviews if theres anything i wanna say ill say right here on my own blog

2690788 having a wall definitely has a bad influence on business
2690789 the wall is not only for the beautification of the surroundings of the city for the olympics
2690790 the main concern is over the protection of the citys environment safety of the field work convenience and safety of passing pedestrians and other factors
2690791 there are individual shops that have not reached agreement to move resulting in delays
2690792 the wall will be replaced by greeneries plants or aesthetic fences
2690793 the government didnt have enough time to get everyone to move
2690794 so the wall went up for the olympics it is just to make a more beautiful environment for the city

2690839 it does what a hawaiian shirt is supposed to do tell you something about the hawaiian islands
2690840 all of the people who come out to see us wear these shirts too
2690841 when i see someone else with an authentic hawaiian shirt i know its a kindred spirit like when you meet people who wear shorts in the winter
2690842 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice

2690848 we will all find ourselves in the position of having to care for a loved one
2690849 we argue over stupid things like who gets to wash the dishes me and briony want to do more than we can cope with sometimes that causes quite a lot of friction because dad feels that we do too much but we dont mind it doesnt take long to put on a wash and you can play while you wait to hang it out
2690850 my role in the morning is to get everyone up and give them their breakfast then tidy up and wake my mum and try to encourage her to get up and dressed
2690851 if only mum could be out of pain and if the kids would do what i ask them if my brother didnt have adhd and my sister didnt have her bad foot
2690852 but im not god and i cant make it go away
2690853 oh it was a wonderful feeling everyone was really happy
2690854 the mum didnt have anything for christmas she burst into tears when she saw me

2690856 caroline if i can get a bunch of young carers to the jungles of borneo i think we can get them to central london
2690857 naomi has grown up a huge amount shes found her independence and shes blooming its been wonderful to see how much everyones interest and concern has boosted her confidence the response over christmas was overwhelming we were able to go out and buy presents and food for families who otherwise wouldnt have had anything the feelgood factor was amazing
2690858 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2690859 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2690860 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day

2690882 underscore this eleventh hour bid to save the nations greatest river
2690883 it sent a very clear message by saying weve had a lot of talk about the river system a lot of science we all know what the problem is we just want politicians to have the will to fix it up
2690884 they need to secure water upstream and send it down
2690885 the charge sheet will be solid and musharraf will not be able to fight it
2690886 musharraf still has time it will be in his own interest if he resigns
2690887 we have far beyond the two thirds majority he should realise this
2690888 this morning some people were going to the grape fields when the bomb exploded on their vehicle five people died and three were wounded
2690889 i have advised the president to choose a dignified exit and resign to save the country from further polarization
2690890 if he did not quit than its obvious i will vote in favor of his impeachment
2690891 i think there would be a settlement no impeachment in view of resignation
2690892 i think he would resign because its a stigma to be the first president who is impeached
2690893 ce ati facut cand a venit apa ce ati simtit credeati ca o sa muriti

2690895 it may not be in five years but it will certainly be within a decade china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific they will be saying what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
2690896 i dont think the success of cricket in china depends on having hundreds of thousands of people playing it in the park on a saturday afternoon i think it depends on promoting it as a television product
2690897 look at india and the commercialisation of cricket there there is no reason why that cant happen in china its a growing economy its a changing economy but its also an economy that is becoming an avid consumer of western culture
2690898 whats in it for cricket there is so much competition for all types of sports now and cricket is no different to any other product in the sense that it cant afford to ignore china
2690899 we hope that there will be new technologies being developed and there will be renewable options other than wind because at moment the only technology is wind
2690900 but we think if there is a bridging period of that 10 years which we think gas can do the work then gas will still be important but it wont carry all the load
2690901 uma medalha muito importante para a ge rgia especialmente em tempos como estes estou muito nervosa hoje s o horas dif ceis para o nosso povo
2690902 that was the first time ive ever gone five rounds in my life and its tough im telling you
2690903 after the third round i was looking at the clock and jon fitch he never died i tried to finish him in the first round i tried everything i saw him fall down and come back and i thought my god what am i going to have to do to stop this guy it was discouraging
2690904 they dont have a lot of money and they sacrificed a lot to get here to see me
2690905 what else do i have to do to prove to people to get a little love
2690906 i won eight fights in a row and then laid the whole heart and soul out in a five round fight with the world champ if that doesnt win the media over nothing will
2690907 ive seen a lot of fighters where his opponents would sit and wait for him but with his speed you cant do that
2690908 it took me about all of the first round to adjust and by that time hed hit me so many times in my left eye i couldnt really see him
2690909 i had a new school every year for eight years
2690910 it was hard she was a single mom her absent father was in the air force then in jail working all the jobs she could but once we were homeless and ended up in the basement of a salvation army church the rest of the kids were going to camp there and had to sneak out each morning and pretend i had just arrived
2690911 when i got to high school i said mom i dont want to move any more and we finally stayed put but even then i stayed with four different families
2690912 i just wanted to get out of poverty and i knew college was the answer
2690913 when i crossed that line i got a flashback to when i didnt make the team
2690914 suddenly i wasnt just the fastest in the u s i was the fastest in the world
2690915 it feels a bit odd when i look back to times when i went 12 races in a row finishing third thinking will i ever win
2690916 we certainly will be impressing on our athletes through their sports section managers that when their competition finishes and they go downtown it would be wise to be branded
2690917 my team members were a little nervous and some players lost the opportunity to score
2690918 therefore we have to resolve the problem in the shooting circle so that we convert opportunities
2690919 the main issue is how to make the best of the opportunities within the shooting circle many of them got the opportunity we also have to make sure that the senior players are kept fresh
2690920 we certainly will be impressing on our athletes through their sports section managers that when their competition finishes and they go downtown it would be wise to be branded
2690921 we really should be insisting they should wear their team gear i think that might be a small precaution i think there is more likelihood of people keeping an eye out for you security and volunteers if you are in olympic gear
2690922 we have had about 120 calls regarding flooding in fife people have called from all over the county its not been confined to one part of the county
2690923 there have been no major evacuations or anything like that but a lot of peoples homes have been flooded its just been excessive rain across the county local burns bursting their banks and things like that
2690924 the amount of rain we have had has been unbelievable and thats been the main focus
2690925 fortunately no one has been injured in any of the incidents
2690926 hes a well polished opponent and i beat him by more than 10 points
2690927 its going to be tough all the way but ill stick it out
2690928 im in a tough draw but ill battle it out and do the best i can

2690948 given whats transpired this year it seems hard to imagine prices could get that low

2690953 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2690954 there was very little self pity its was all about next
2690955 especially after a reversal it was always you stay in the game and it was very much a game
2690956 it proves the fact that all along the questions weve been asking about the legitimacy of local 715 have been valid
2690957 i dont think it does anything to justify their withdrawal of recognition
2690958 the stanford workers were part of a larger vote that happened in 2006 and stanford was one of the only employers in california who raised an objection to that process

2690972 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2690973 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2690974 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2690975 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2690976 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you

2690978 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him

2690993 you should hear the sound of these children and their caregivers

2690995 the public needs to appreciate how seriously we took the 70 percent vote for jessicas law and public safety

2691012 you see people coming in here and they try things on but you see that hesitancy
2691013 they walk out without buying it theyre not ready to make that impulse buy because theyre afraid of whats going to happen in the future
2691014 now no sale is good enough no price is low enough
2691015 du kannst harte gegner oder gro e favoriten genauso schlagen wie du gegen eine algerierin verlieren kannst du musst einfach aufpassen
2691016 sie ist die absolute favoritin in meiner gewichtsklasse und sie ist auch ein verstecktes geheimnis denn sie k mpft eigentlich keine wettkampfturniere
2691017 das war wohl eine von ihren zwei drei einzigen niederlagen berhaupt in ihrem leben
2691018 immer wenn sie auftaucht schlagt sie alle um die ohren sie ist aber auch eine unbekannte weil sie fast nie an einem training in europa teilnimmt man hat sie nicht auf video mit den anderen trainiert man und das kann man mit ihr halt nicht ich kenne ihr k rpergef hl und die k rperspannung von ihr berhaupt nicht aber andererseits kennt sie mich ja auch nicht besonders bis auf das eine mal
2691019 das offen und ehrlich zu sagen ich m chte olympia gold holen das ist mein traum ich muss ihn in der ffentlichkeit aussprechen damit er auch wahr werden kann
2691020 ich habe so wundersch ne gedanken an athen ich stelle mir das schwierig vor wenn ich jetzt als erinnerung eine erstrundenniederlage h tte
2691021 es macht mich auch nicht nerv s dass ich schon silber habe und man dann ja eigentlich nur noch eines draufsetzen kann ganz im gegenteil ich bin zuletzt immer ruhiger geworden ich wei aus erfahrung dass ich es schaffen kann bei olympia auf das stockerl zu kommen
2691022 das klingt besser als claudia heill die zwei olympiamedaillen gewonnen hat
2691023 seit der em seit dem kontinuierlichem aufbau und dem fokus auf olympia habe ich keine schmerzen mehr es hat fast drei jahre gedauert aber jetzt bin ich in der absoluten topform wenn nicht in peking dann nicht mehr mit der routine und der form und der lockerheit bin ich absolut auf dem richtigen weg ich bin reif f r die zweite medaille
2691024 ich habe einen kurzen moment nachgedacht warum das sterreichische olympische komitee an mir zweifelt und noch eine best tigung wollte aber dieser wettkampf hat kein problem f r mich dargestellt hat auch nicht von der nervosit t her ich war wieder in einem finale und bei olympia bin ich das hoffentlich wieder
2691025 ich liebe dieses land und die menschen hier viel zu sehr
2691026 whats fascinating about this study is that you would not expect to find contagious yawning where you did not have self awareness

2691030 one of the least reported and most scandalous features of the khartoum regimes domestic policies
2691031 national wealth and power to further enrich itself and its cronies while the marginalized regions of the country suffer from terrible poverty
2691032 it does have the potential to be the breadbasket of africa
2691033 the good news is that these fees are easily avoided
2691034 a lot of small institutions such as local community banks and credit unions that do not have large atm networks have joined atm alliances
2691035 for the member institutions it really levels the playing field in terms of competing against large banks that have far flung atm networks
2691036 we wanted to go beyond the co op network they are primarily located at other credit unions whats really nice about the allpoint network is where they are located
2691037 they are at targets riteaids and other retail locations where you normally do your shopping now you have a place to get cash its consumer friendly that way
2691038 its a consistent and significant investment we make in the ongoing development of this huge national network
2691039 we believe it is appropriate to charge a reasonable surcharge to non customers to access the convenience of our network
2691040 banks provide free access to their atms so the key is to plan ahead as to when and where you make withdrawals
2691041 whenever i am on the road i go to a store and buy a small item and get 50 back
2691042 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good
2691043 more money in a familys pocket is what makes sense to me right now with how things are going
2691044 i dont believe we can continue to borrow to stay afloat you cant continue to borrow and pass your debt to your children and grandchildren
2691045 we need more of that kind of transportation less cars on the road
2691046 the valley med thing that has to happen thats just a huge trauma unit
2691047 all of our money is going to feeding two kids
2691048 he has an open invitation to chamber events hes surprised us on occasion when he wasnt expected
2691049 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2691050 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2691051 a cease fire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2691052 oh its ok if my living is somehow harming you ill just go kill myself
2691053 well you know it started off with a big argument really

2691066 i would like to state that ryan was a decent hardworking young man and loving son
2691067 this is an extremely difficult time for all of us that knew and loved ryan and i would ask that we are given the time and
2691068 i would urge anyone that knows or saw anything to come forward and assist officers from operation trident in their ongoing efforts to trace witnesses to this cold blooded and reckless act
2691069 zo lang kunnen we echt niet wachten de klachten over het gehandicaptenvervoer blijven binnenstromen de staatssecretaris moet het contract met connexxion nu openbreken en sociale afspraken maken zodat gehandicapten en ouderen verzekerd zijn van goed en punctueel vervoer
2691070 het vervoer van onze ouderen en gehandicapten is te waardevol om aan te besteden als een product
2691071 de ervaringen bij het overige taxivervoer heeft ons al geleerd dat aanbesteding de kwaliteit niet ten goede komt en er slechts gekeken wordt naar de laagste prijs stoppen met die aanbesteding dus

2691086 theres nothing sexier than a guy inviting you over for a meal and watching him cook it
2691087 my idea of cooking is adding milk to some cereal and eating it in bed after work so the fact he can make real meals is a huge bonus

2691099 aku tidak melihat kezuhudan itu paling kurang melainkan dalam perkara kepimpinan kuasa engkau akan dapati seseorang yang zuhud dalam makanan minuman harta dan pakaian tetapi apabila tiba soal kuasa maka dia akan mempertahan dan bermusuhan kerananya

2691107 over the next 12 to 18 months theres a very uncomfortable set of circumstances as every vendor rushes out to say weve virtualized
2691108 a virtual switch is just a piece of code like a hypervisor
2691109 it all boils down to three settings in a gui
2691110 if i decide to v motion a firewall it wont work
2691111 you wont get rid of host based security software as we add more solutions we add complexity
2691112 owning the windows pc is not really a priority anymore
2691113 all the basic really easy exploits you could use against network services are really gone
2691114 to me its part of the tool kit when you do forensics but its not the only tool you should rely on
2691115 guess how secure that is in the face of a dns attack
2691116 ssls not the panacea we would like it to be
2691117 i do not want to see my cell phone bill this month
2691118 the entire scope of the attack is even yet to be fully realized

2691123 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2691124 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2691125 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it

2691156 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2691157 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2691158 this is definitely necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea
2691159 a sea blockade of georgia will also help avert an escalation of military activity in abkhazia
2691160 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2691161 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2691162 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops

2691190 now we are allowing industry professionals to register and attend any of our 450 regular courses offered every semester
2691191 this is not like a professional development programme but like a regular class that our students go through they can attend classes along with our students and brush up skills in the laboratories
2691192 it is expected that in the years to come iit delhi will be seen as a major catalyst by the industries in their attempt to move up the value chain this is because it requires major upgradation of their manpower skills and iit by reaching out to them can play a vital role
2691193 we have already registered 42 professionals this semester the aim is to fully utilise our resources and help others grow
2691194 but there is no restriction on any industry professional and the course that he or she wants to pursue
2691195 this a pilot project and once it delivers results it will provide a major boost for industry professionals we may also have a full fledged set up for this distant education mode

2691282 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted

2691287 school performance should not be seen simply as a proxy for intelligence
2691288 doing badly at school is not a cause of schizophrenia but it is a marker for something not being quite right several years prior to diagnosis
2691289 this isnt going to be a way of identifying people at school who are at risk of developing schizophrenia
2691290 but it could be useful when considering someone who is displaying other potential symptoms of impending psychosis
2691291 it is important to recognise that mental illnesses like schizophrenia are not linked to low intelligence the opposite is often true
2691292 there are lots of reasons why young people perform poorly in exams
2691293 problems with concentration and mental distress can interfere with studying and these can also be early signs of mental illness symptoms that commonly begin in late teens

2691303 my aim was to get pole position for airwaves ducati today but the team has worked hard to give me a really good set up for both the wet and the dry so im feeling positive about the two races tomorrow whatever the weather
2691304 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2691305 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2691306 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2691307 love child what else you will find love and lose it again and again with each finding and each loss you will become more than before what you make of it is yours to choose
2691308 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2691309 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2691310 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2691311 uma medalha muito importante para a ge rgia especialmente em tempos como estes estou muito nervosa hoje s o horas dif ceis para nossa gente
2691312 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2691313 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2691330 given whats transpired this year it seems hard to imagine prices could get that low

2691342 bernie meant more to me than i could ever describe to you
2691343 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead

2691345 especially after a reversal it was always you stay in the game and it was very much a game
2691346 it proves the fact that all along the questions weve been asking about the legitimacy of local 715 have been valid
2691347 i dont think it does anything to justify their withdrawal of recognition
2691348 the stanford workers were part of a larger vote that happened in 2006 and stanford was one of the only employers in california who raised an objection to that process
2691349 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2691350 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2691351 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2691352 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2691353 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2691354 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2691355 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2691356 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2691357 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2691358 its been a boatload of money to put it colloquially

2691370 the good news is that these fees are easily avoided
2691371 a lot of small institutions such as local community banks and credit unions that do not have large atm networks have joined atm alliances
2691372 for the member institutions it really levels the playing field in terms of competing against large banks that have far flung atm networks
2691373 we wanted to go beyond the co op network they are primarily located at other credit unions whats really nice about the allpoint network is where they are located
2691374 they are at targets riteaids and other retail locations where you normally do your shopping now you have a place to get cash its consumer friendly that way
2691375 its a consistent and significant investment we make in the ongoing development of this huge national network
2691376 we believe it is appropriate to charge a reasonable surcharge to non customers to access the convenience of our network
2691377 banks provide free access to their atms so the key is to plan ahead as to when and where you make withdrawals
2691378 whenever i am on the road i go to a store and buy a small item and get 50 back

2691396 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan

2691406 you can talk about it in the classroom but until you get out here and have all the variables in place you just cant simulate it the stress level so many things in your head

2691414 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation

2691424 we turned down google because we already had six search engines in our portfolio
2691425 now we try to make sure we dont let any e mails fall through the cracks
2691426 more money in a familys pocket is what makes sense to me right now with how things are going
2691427 i dont believe we can continue to borrow to stay afloat you cant continue to borrow and pass your debt to your children and grandchildren
2691428 we need more of that kind of transportation less cars on the road
2691429 the valley med thing that has to happen thats just a huge trauma unit
2691430 all of our money is going to feeding two kids
2691431 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
2691432 when the world is running down you make the best of whats still around
2691433 hes a well polished opponent and i beat him by more than 10 points
2691434 its going to be tough all the way but ill stick it out
2691435 im in a tough draw but ill battle it out and do the best i can
2691436 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic sea ice
2691437 the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years
2691438 quer a ir por el r cord pero no estaba seguro si deb a hacerlo pero en la zona de calentamiento sent un cosquilleo en mi cuerpo y me comenc a emocionar
2691439 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
2691440 it is a dream come true for us really as it is a great time to showcase the womens game on a global scale
2691441 twenty20 has really caught on and it is the question i am asked most about at the moment along with the indian premier league hopefully they will have a womens ipl so i wont have to worry about money for the rest of my life but it is exciting times in cricket at the moment for men and women next year with the twenty20 world cup being here is brilliant and hopefully that money will come streaming in
2691442 the womens game will grow if we get more games on television and the way to do that is get more twenty20 games because obviously it is more exciting people often compare it to the mens game but it is different
2691443 if people came to watch it they would see it for what it is and realise that we actually are just as good fielders we may not be able to hit the ball quite as hard or bowl quite as fast but the skill level is still there when people come down to watch they are often surprised and hopefully they want to come back and watch us
2691444 we were quite lucky in getting them because there is a trend that a lot of girls were falling out of them game at 26 27 so we are under contract now and for eight months of the year which allows us to coach within the schools
2691445 it helps us to have a career path but it also lets us play cricket all year round so it works really well for chance to shine and it works really well for us we have had a good impact so far so it has been a successful summer so far doing that
2691446 since we won the ashes in 2005 there has been a massive increase in girls playing the sport and for us to play a part in that by winning and successfully retaining the ashes earlier this year it is massive we have just got to keep playing good cricket and hopefully people will come back and watch us and girls will choose cricket over other sports
2691447 it is really sad because michael has done a hell of a lot for the england team and i have a great amount of admiration for the guy seeing him emotional was very sad he has been a great leader and i thought he was going to see us through to the next ashes
2691448 i think it was inevitable kp would take over really he plays both forms of the game and is our best player i just hope it doesnt affect his game which i dont think it will most things chucked at kevin pietersen he has been able to deal with so i imagine he will deal with this in the same way
2691449 it was exciting because you join the army to do this
2691450 im not doing mad things like the infantry are but it still shows you what your job is all about this is the real thing
2691451 i had a couple of jobs but i was not a very well behaved teenager so i had to do something
2691452 i cant wait to see my family and give them big hugs
2691453 when i first get here it wasnt that hot because it was winter but obviously it has got really warm i went on r amp r rest and recreation in june and when i came back it was really hot you have just got to get on with it after a while you dont think about it
2691454 some people get down about being away from home but we all sit down together have a laugh and get on with it
2691455 my mums worried but your mums going to be worried i think if i went on a train to london shed be worried
2691456 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2691457 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2691458 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2691459 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2691460 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2691461 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2691462 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2691463 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2691464 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2691465 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2691466 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2691467 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2691468 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2691469 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2691470 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2691471 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2691472 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2691473 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2691474 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2691475 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2691476 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2691477 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2691478 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2691508 the spring of heaven and earth has just come now
2691509 we handed a comprehensive dossier to his office but were are not happy with the response
2691510 it raises the fundamental question why is the violence still continuing
2691511 why is mbeki not getting mugabe to stop the violence how can a real honest settlement be achieved while violence is being perpetrated on innocent people
2691512 what is the use of a political settlement if the people have to live in the midst of death
2691513 my husband said we should follow it and get the registration number so that we could report the driver
2691514 it was complete devastation a turned over car other people trying to get out of smashed cars signs and street lights destroyed
2691515 i then saw a car being dragged by the truck towards the railway pedestrian bridge
2691516 the sign clearly states that these trucks are not allowed on the road but there is no enforcement by metro police
2691517 you can hear them the trucks screaming down the road it is not the first time there has been an accident why are the police not doing something
2691518 they honk their horns and carry on straight through without stopping
2691519 this will ensure that no large trucks can enter that strip of bluff road
2691520 if you want to be in the next cabinet you had better be seated in the front row at this trial
2691521 zumas attack does not say you cannot prosecute me because i am innocent or that i am being unfairly tried
2691522 it says that i should not be put on trial because the decision to prosecute me was unlawful it is quite divorced from innocence or guilt
2691523 creches are essential and as time goes by more and more community based home creches will mushroom up around us the rules and regulations for them are there as stipulated by the department of health and the department of social welfare
2691524 the problem is that they are not being enforced by these departments
2691525 we strongly condemn the incident at pietermaritzburg as the owner was not registered and had no licence to begin with minister meshack radebe has been vocal about it urging people to register their creches so that they may receive the stipulated guidelines and regulations to function correctly
2691526 people need to go their regional offices and register its only once we know of the creche through this process that we can assist them
2691527 it isnt necessarily a money making business if youre doing it properly running a creche will not make you wealthy
2691528 in rural communities there are support systems in place the women will often get together and decide who will care for the children and who will work it can cost as little as r80 a month and is a real service
2691529 theres no concrete under our jungle gym weve used soft beach sand that is disinfected every two weeks
2691530 all our equipment is checked regularly as well among other things we ensure swings with planks dont have any nails protruding and that cabinets are stable

2691534 the clippers made it very difficult for me to get over here with the insurance and them not wanting me to go
2691535 i was a little disappointed with them at the time with the way they handled stuff they lied to me a couple times and i didnt appreciate it but it worked out in the end there was a lot of stuff in the end i had to fight about and i hope the clippers are proud of what i accomplished well see
2691536 i dont want to go into that i dont want to throw the clippers under the bus things i wouldnt do personally to someone they should trust me by now ive been playing basketball for them for five years and ive always come in in shape

2691630 a married woman should endure any violence or torture imposed on her by her husband for she is fully at his disposal without his permission she may not leave her house even for a good action such as charitable work otherwise her prayers and devotions will not be accepted by god and curses of heaven and earth will fall upon her

2691632 we are thrilled that circus circus reno has invited us to help them in their fundraising efforts
2691633 its a great program because it fills three needs at once
2691634 first it gives employees and patrons of organizations a chance to sell old jewelry getting instant cash for unwanted outdated or broken items that have been collecting dust in a box or drawer second it recycles precious metals which helps alleviate the need for further mining and damage to the environment
2691635 it really gives companies a unique way to raise thousands of dollars for a great cause weve had an overwhelming positive response from this program so far
2691636 the objects we pick up and use in our daily lives from cameras can openers and computer keyboards to bread knives cheque books and tape measures are designed for right handed people and we left handers have to adapt and muddle along
2691637 international left handers day was launched 16 years ago by the left handers club and one of the reasons behind it is to encourage manufacturers to design left handed versions of their products in order to make our lives that bit easier
2691638 although there is a wide range of invaluable left handed products available via the left handed site we want to see far more choice on the market after all left handers make up 10 of the population so theres a big demand out there
2691639 if the legislation holds i believe we can expect two developments first there will be heightened activity in the period up to october 1st as affected homebuyers seek to lock into homes before they get sidelined and arent able to second we will see an appreciable decline in buyer activity and home sales as a result of down payment assistances elimination after october 1st buyers who could have purchased homes will have to wait or give up their search
2691640 we could see a 10 or greater decline in our already suffering housing market that potentially moves us away from a market that is recovering to one that is stinging taking this one step further i dont know how much more the broader economy could handle if a similar result took place across the united states
2691641 regardless of the side of the debate one is on the market reality is that wholesale elimination of the down payment assistance option does present a risk to the phoenix housing market its been an important enabler and i hope there is a compromise solution that congress and the president will take up before we see down payment assistance go completely away
2691642 frozen sperm banks have been available for over thirty years egg freezing and thawing has been much more technically challenging nevertheless research has progressed and various options for egg freezing and banking have now arrived
2691643 frozen eggs offer women options in deciding when they wish to conceive whether with their own eggs or with donor eggs
2691644 some women have diseases such as cancer earlier in life and must delay childbearing in addition cancer treatments can destroy eggs around the world many women have chosen to bank their eggs and or ovarian tissue for future use others have opted to use donor eggs

2691686 ich habe so wundersch ne gedanken an athen ich stelle mir das schwierig vor wenn ich jetzt als erinnerung eine erstrundenniederlage h tte

2691690 ich habe einen kurzen moment nachgedacht warum das sterreichische olympische komitee an mir zweifelt und noch eine best tigung wollte aber dieser wettkampf hat kein problem f r mich dargestellt hat auch nicht von der nervosit t her ich war wieder in einem finale und bei olympia bin ich das hoffentlich wieder

2691699 if your nerve endings are exposed in any event when it comes to this other parent then when anything is out of whack it becomes a major issue
2691700 with some cases when you say the last name at the courthouse everybody knows who youre talking about because theyre there all the time
2691701 its a great deal of trust the parents have to put into somebody
2691702 what i can tell them is look folks i might sometimes agree with you mom and i might sometimes agree with you dad
2691703 i feel awkward about having that kind of power because i believe if i make a mistake someone should have the right to appeal it
2691704 thats why its such a weird area to be practicing in
2691705 if its ill agree to that unless i lose well theres no point in that
2691706 there were several things that didnt get resolved because the money dries up at some point
2691707 so having a third party that is less expensive wouldve been beneficial
2691708 so shes getting it one week at one parents and not the next week
2691709 i dont believe there is any solid data on benefits

2691711 you will see the food industry being supportive of government action
2691712 weve seen whats happened over the last eight years of government inaction
2691713 there are parts of this bill that you couldnt previously bring republicans around to
2691714 its recognized in both political parties and recognized in food as well as pharmaceuticals that the agency needs an overhaul
2691715 we dont know how long it will take for consumer confidence in fresh tomatoes to rebound
2691716 we have to allow this agency to mature into an effective 21st century agency to protect families
2691717 this is another example of what is possible if you invest in renewable energy technologies

2691723 a lot of those kids came to postville and went right to work
2691724 we wouldve loved to have all those kids in school for funding and stuff and of course to educate them
2691725 its a shame that kids 14 years old were working at a place like that we did everything possible to find them and get them educated and keep them
2691726 every worker who spoke with the mission participants expressed a degree of satisfaction with how much they were being paid and the hours which they worked
2691727 some of the workers noted that the working conditions and the hourly wages that they were being paid at the agriprocessors plant were a stark improvement over conditions they faced in other meat and poultry plants that they had worked at in the past
2691728 many spent a great deal of time speaking to the workers and visiting different areas of the plant unannounced
2691729 statements from union officials and others who do not necessarily have personal knowledge of the situation
2691730 we discovered workers being treated equitably and receiving fair wages and benefits
2691731 we saw a state of the art plant a tremendous emphasis on safety and excellent standards of kashruth jewish dietary laws while we have no personal knowledge of what may or may not have happened in the past the agriprocessors plant that we saw today is far different than what has been reported

2691739 this was a great place to work i love my job
2691740 hopefully they rebuild i mean id like to come back here and work
2691741 by that time we can give them an idea of what the companys going to do and what their future is and how thats going to play out
2691742 jake began making ignorant and offensive statements to the group
2691743 to their credit they continued to leave and exited the residence
2691744 came running at them yelling for the return of the cell phone
2691745 nick said he was going to beat the s out of them
2691746 jake pushed mike mette at least two times maybe three after the last push mike planted a fist into jakes face that knocked jake to the ground
2691747 without a doubt there was an assault committed by mette
2691748 mette was not the initial aggressor of this incident nick and jake came at the group of six in a threatening manner it was reasonable under the circumstances to believe that harm might come to any of the individuals standing outside on the street
2691749 failed to retreat from the house or walk away and call police about the disturbance because of his failure to take these steps the court cannot find that the self defense justification is available to permit the striking of jake
2691750 if given the discretion to render a decision more appropriate to the facts the court would have imposed a deferred judgment
2691751 mike was threatened and was shoved at least twice and did nothing in response
2691752 hes shoved again and he hits the guy hes defending himself do they put you in prison for five years in iowa for defending yourself when a drunk keeps coming at you
2691753 she commends mike and the others for walking away he didnt react until hed been hit three times mike hit him once she convicts him its insane
2691754 this is as close as i can get to agriculture and maintain those agricultural roots

2691757 violence against women on college campuses is an epidemic research shows college is where they are more likely to experience it than at any other time in their lives
2691758 frankly many of the situations are low key and the students prefer it be handled that way
2691759 eod officials were aggressive and forceful in their interviewing tactics and accusatory in their stance
2691760 the numbers youre talking about dont reflect reality in society let alone on college campuses
2691761 sometimes things are unfounded in terms of finding a violation of university policy but we say the department should make some changes
2691762 unless student services gets recommendations they are hard pressed to respond
2691763 there was a time when we could refer cases directly to associate dean of students tom bakers office thats not the policy anymore
2691764 so they consult with us to make sure safety issues are dealt with and to make sure the complainants are aware of their options
2691765 we dont do what the police do and we arent the rape victim advocacy program
2691766 we are not trying to substitute what we do for what others are doing generally we are trying to create the kind of climate where everybody can feel safe and secure
2691767 the way it is now the victim can have one person usually thats a friend or the mom or someone close to her if anybody

2691773 i looked up and he waved the flag nodded his head that was pretty cool a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and be here today
2691774 i knew it was going to be tough all the way through
2691775 looking and seeing all three of us close together at the 200 i wasnt really very comfortable i wanted to have more of a gap
2691776 it wasnt my best time im not really proud of it but i did everything i could thats all i can ask for

2691783 i would love to see all open source innovation happen on top of windows
2691784 well extensions conf started out as a very simply solution to solve asterisks initially simple problems it was not designed to be a full feature programming language
2691785 but its now a language with functions control statements loops labels conditions variables even macros and subroutines
2691786 yeah but its not a programming language it wasnt mean to be
2691787 yeah someones probably thought of that let me go check online
2691788 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2691789 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2691790 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2691791 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2691792 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2691793 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2691794 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2691795 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2691796 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2691797 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2691798 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2691799 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2691800 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2691801 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2691802 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2691803 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2691804 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2691805 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2691806 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2691807 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2691808 underscore this eleventh hour bid to save the nations greatest river
2691809 it sent a very clear message by saying weve had a lot of talk about the river system a lot of science we all know what the problem is we just want politicians to have the will to fix it up
2691810 they need to secure water upstream and send it down

2691817 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2691818 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2691819 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2691820 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2691821 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2691822 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2691823 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2691824 de heerser over de russische aarde is steeds de rus dit was zo en zal steeds zo zijn
2691825 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2691826 tcs do not want to live in a gc state run by gcs full stop
2691827 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2691828 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2691829 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2691830 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2691831 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2691832 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2691833 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2691834 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2691835 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2691836 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2691837 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2691838 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2691839 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2691840 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2691841 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2691842 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2691843 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2691844 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2691845 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2691846 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2691847 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2691848 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2691849 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2691850 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2691851 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2691852 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2691853 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2691855 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2691856 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2691857 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2691858 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2691859 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2691860 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2691861 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2691862 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2691863 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2691864 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2691865 who are open to doing something on the production side
2691866 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2691867 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2691868 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2691869 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2691870 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2691871 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2691872 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2691873 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2691874 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2691875 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2691876 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2691877 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2691878 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2691879 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2691880 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2691881 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2691882 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2691883 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2691884 and what follows is the most insane over the top brutal fight scene youve ever seen in car full of clawing and screaming and ripping and even some brutal stapling thats right stapling its shocking scary and all at once bizarrely funny
2691885 the recent medical controversy over whether vaccinations cause autism reveals a habit of human cognition thinking anecdotally comes naturally whereas thinking scientifically does not
2691886 has been the driest of tinder the only question was where the fire would start
2691887 concerned by natos plans for further extension to former soviet republics and kosovos unilateral but westernorchestrated independence russia has stepped up manipulation of the south ossetia and abkhazia conflicts georgia remains determined to restore its territorial integrity and hawks in tbilisi are seriously considering a military option
2691888 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2691889 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2691890 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2691891 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2691892 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2691893 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2691894 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2691895 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2691896 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2691897 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2691898 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2691899 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2691900 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2691901 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2691902 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2691903 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2691904 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2691905 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2691906 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2691907 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2691908 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2691909 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2691910 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2691911 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2691912 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2691913 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2691914 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2691915 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2691916 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2691917 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2691918 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2691919 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2691920 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2691921 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2691922 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2691923 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2691924 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2691925 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2691926 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2691927 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2691928 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2691929 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2691930 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2691931 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2691932 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2691933 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2691934 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2691935 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2691936 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2691937 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2691938 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2691939 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2691940 audiovisual processing was much enhanced in musicians brains compared to non musician counterparts and musicians also were more sensitive to subtle changes in both speech and music sounds
2691941 our study indicates that the high level cognitive processing of music affects automatic processing that occurs early in the processing stream and fundamentally shapes sensory circuitry
2691942 musicians have a specialized neural system for processing sight and sound in the brainstem the neural gateway to the brain
2691943 musicians have enhanced subcortical auditory and audiovisual processing of speech and music
2691944 the study underscores the extreme malleability of auditory function by music training and the potential of music to tune our neural response to the world around us

2691950 there is a social order and sexual abusers of children are generally considered at the bottom of the order
2691951 amendment 1 has really forced our republicans to act like republicans

2691953 you always have anxiety but when that bell rings you just step up to the plate and you do what you have to do
2691954 you would think that logic would let them know that they shouldnt be there but there are still some people that would go to have a look

2691962 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2691963 maybe it will be quiet in the future im an optimist
2691964 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2691965 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2691966 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2691967 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2691968 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2691969 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2691970 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2691971 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2691972 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia the escalation in fighting is dangerously destabilising and there is also the threat of civilian losses on a large scale
2691973 reports of fighting and bombing outside south ossetia are especially disturbing as they represent a broadening and deepening of the conflict the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible

2692009 its just too power hungry which is why most 3g phones have nowhere near eight hours of talktime
2692010 in the long term it will be interesting to see how consumers will react to having to pay for this device
2692011 obviously in the uk most consumers are used to getting their devices for free
2692012 thats a huge section of the market that is not going to be purchasing an iphone in the contract segment there are a lot of people who are not going to pay 35 a month
2692013 but for a large group of people the iphone is certainly an attractive proposition
2692014 people love their experience with the iphone they dont love the experience with other phones that is why our sales are through the roof
2692015 we assume that the device will find a very good reception on the market

2692019 what is samsung doing to match the user interface of the iphone
2692020 were actively working on new user interfaces and you can expect to see something special in 2008
2692021 obviously some people may go looking for the iphone but may be put off by the price and i think apples various competitors in the market will be positioning themselves to take advantage of that
2692022 its only just being explored to its fullest the iphone right now does it fairly well its going to be the touch screen experience competitors will be looking to beat
2692023 this generation does not want an archive of music we offer unlimited music on a rental model no one has done this in the marketplace and certainly not the iphone

2692037 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2692038 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2692039 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2692040 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2692041 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2692042 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2692043 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2692044 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2692074 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2692075 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2692136 the bush administration is running a federal budget deficit at an unsustainable system dooming pace of about 3 5 trillion a year according to econometrician john williams who publishes the website shadow government statistics adbe i note that after the last earnings report it gapped up about 3 ive no insight into what adbe will be reporting this quarter a disappointing quarter plus the announcement of the beginning of a public beta for cs3 might be neutral barring macroeconomic perturbations and obviously absent other news the quarter by itself could gap either way anyway i note that with adbe at 40 60 the dec 40 calls are at 1 50 and the dec 42 50 calls are at 0 50 calls because im an optimist only if youre feeling foolhardy december 14 2006 at 9 58 am looks like esv is breaking out no particular reason other than defense of 60 oil statement very tempting to sell the dec 55s here but well see how it handles the air up there dont forget nat gas at 10 30 they expect a draw over 100bcf and im hoping to get a whack at the oih 150 puts as a day trade sndk and any move dont trust it into expirations dow 12 373 i see stars opec official statement at 11 i have a meeting thats really annoying unfortunately oil so far looks like a rally not a spike i do like cvx off the 75 mark but id rather take them after the turn than try to guess a top right now phil i thought you have to pay in order to get ur everyday comments i signed up and logged in and waiting then i check the free site i was using b4 and thats where u are phil i feel your pain ive got to leave for a meeting in the next 9 minutes or im going to be late im gonna miss everything waah transports flying too makes no sense on oil news but well take it december 14 2006 at 10 10 am phil wishing sen johnson the best i wonder if the potential swing away from democratic power in january could signal a possible upside for pharma december 14 2006 at 10 14 am i think oil is partying on the senators pain more than opec as without the senate there is little the house can do that will have teeth i am covering with dia jan 123 puts for 1 10 as i doubt the dow will hit 12 400 over the weekend so i have little to lose there rimm soaring hoping 140 before earnings december 14 2006 at 10 29 am as long as bill frist is around we can get him to testify that sen johnson is fit for duty even if hes in a coma to quote the great senator during the last coma question and from my standpoint as a physician i would be very careful before i would come to the floor and say this that the facts upon which this case were based are inadequate to be able to make a diagnosis of persistent vegetative state which is not brain dead it is not coma it is a specific diagnosis and typically takes multiple examinations over a period of time because you are looking for responsiveness i have looked at the video footage based on the footage provided to me which was part of the facts of the case she does respond

2692181 re opening the seniority issue is simply air canada responding to what amounts to blackmail by its former air canada pilots who the company wants to appease so they will accept the acquisition of new boeing 777 787s
2692182 in 2003 air canada management original air canada pilots and former canadian airlines pilots all agreed that the pilot seniority award of arbitrator brian keller would be final and binding this move shows a troubling disrespect for the law we trust the cirb canadian industrial relations board will unequivocally reject this appeal
2692183 in the unlikely event that the cirb agrees to re open the issue it would be a dangerous precedent that could jeopardize the seniority awards of all other air canada unions all final and binding arbitrators awards and all cirb decisions
2692184 both parties are being unethical and dishonest for their narrow self interest acpa wants to push the ocp group as far down the seniority list as possible and air canada is pretending to assist acpa so that they can re activate their new aircraft order this has nothing to do with fairness
2692185 the decision to begin the mediation process was approved by acpas master executive council today
2692186 for the pilots and for the company we must resolve the issue in a fair way that allows us to move forward

2692280 the north koreans dont like to hear the term human rights but that does not mean that we shouldnt raise it
2692281 is abysmal and every day that the people of north korea continue to suffer represents an unacceptable continuation of oppression

2692283 how much does it pain my heart and my soul to announce to the palestinian people the arab and islamic world and to everyone who loves peace and freedom the passing of the star of palestine
2692284 the absence of our great poet mahmud darwish the love of palestine and the pioneer of the modern palestinian cultural project will leave a great void in our cultural political and national life
2692285 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging
2692286 young people dont want this ungrateful job which is very badly paid 1 85 per hour so several schools have asked me to work for them
2692287 i belong to a generation that experienced shortages after the war then during the communist era and now economic instability after the price explosion
2692288 i know how to save money but i cant even think of comparing myself to others like me in the west who can make the most of their retirement and travel
2692289 at the beginning this plunge down the social ladder really got to me but ive resigned myself because one has to eat
2692290 it pains me to see foreign pensioners who come to our holiday resorts while our own cant afford it
2692291 were renting out a flat and a shop in sofias city centre
2692292 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2692293 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2692294 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a ceasefire
2692295 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on non use of force with south ossetians
2692296 pasti ini karena sebelumnya udah diwarnain jadi muncul lagi warnanya kena obat bondingnya
2692297 we havent had any recent contact with real madrid has there been any attempt to heal the rift yeah that will be right
2692298 they put a bid in i dont know if it was fax or letter or whatever just one it was sometime in the summer
2692299 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days
2692300 it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance
2692301 i think we will just let the thing settle down now it will take its course
2692302 here i am u can count on me i wont fail u
2692303 he was here thats for sure i like his hair its like mine in the seventies but i cant tell you any more than that
2692304 id like to think that once the coloccini deal is completed then two more players will arrive and then well see what happens
2692305 it is wise to do so while some air services are still available and the border remains open
2692306 serious fighting continues in the conflict zone of south ossetia
2692307 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to
2692308 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2692309 it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces
2692310 but i am saying there is no way in which it fits with the culturally sophisticated brand i wish to sell
2692311 popcorn is a contentious issue lots of people absolutely hate it and have asked us to ban it so were going to do exactly that
2692312 if its a success and ive no reason to suspect it wont be well roll it out across all our cinemas and make it a permanent fixture
2692313 yap buru buru dalam memutuskan sesuatu bisa saja bukan akal tapi emosi yg kerja walau ada saat untuk mengambil keputusan pada saat itu juga karena kondisi yg terjepit
2692314 suggest that the company may not be ready for such a drastic change in product strategy in the near term

2692317 as with most media in the u s it is very self serving which was the only reason for the delayed broadcast as long as the majority of viewers were blocked from seeing it until prime access and prime time then they could charge their advertisers the maximum rates for the most expensive day part people in the u s with satellite or who lived by a border could see the ceremonies live or repeated in the morning and without all the american flag waving
2692318 and then the olympics will be covered with less patriotic fervor and perhaps americans will be able to see the worlds best athletes when they dont happen to be from the u s

2692326 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2692327 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2692328 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2692329 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2692330 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2692331 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2692332 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2692333 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2692334 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2692335 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2692336 this is definitely necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea
2692337 a sea blockade of georgia will also help avert an escalation of military activity in abkhazia
2692338 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2692339 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2692340 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2692341 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2692342 we have reviewed the coordinate reference system used by microsoft google etc and believe that it is technically flawed we will not devalue the epsg dataset by including such inappropriate geodesy and cartography
2692343 along with his commitment to clean air and water and to conserving open space he has been a leader on the issue of global warming with the courage to call the nation to action on an issue we can no longer afford to ignore by addressing this problem responsibly john mccain believes we can meet our obligation to be proper caretakers of creation in a manner of which we can be proud by protecting our country strengthening our economy and addressing the challenges of our time rather than leaving a much worse problem for our children

2692348 if it came to troublemaking he was the first to join in
2692349 he really didnt let his parents tell him what to do
2692350 she wouldnt let people know that if she was disappointed
2692351 they said we dont send him money anymore because he has money himself
2692352 cops use tasers more than diggers use tired memes what will it take for this disturbing trend to reverse itself

2692355 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province brigadier dawson said
2692356 shadow governor responsible for authorising bomb attacks across the province
2692357 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan brigadier dawson said
2692358 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province brigadier dawson said
2692359 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12 people

2692379 shell live with this for the rest of her life but we got her away from him
2692380 the thing i dont want is for this to go to trial and a jury to give him probation
2692381 the settlement gave those children a sense of security that could not be guaranteed if they had to sit across from him in the courtroom and testify before a jury
2692382 i walked up and asked him what he was doing
2692383 he said you and your muscleman dont scare me ill protect myself
2692384 that was what i was trying to do 50 years ago and the attorney general of texas stopped me
2692385 when he broke ground on jamaica beach he was only 30 years old a young man with a vision
2692386 it was something very unique when you look at the desolate barren island land then who could have envisioned all the communities on the west end and where they are at today he might have been a little ahead of his time
2692387 jamaica beach was my favorite project because i was so personally involved in it
2692388 the rich people had a second home but the middle class didnt
2692389 the first thing we had to do is convince people they needed a second home and then we had to convince them that jamaica beach is where they wanted to be
2692390 it isnt one of those things where you drop a meter in the water and read a needle
2692391 there was a report that the insurgents were meeting in the village and foreign soldiers surrounded the area
2692392 there was fighting in the village and then helicopters and fighter jets came
2692393 the village elders called me to say they were going to bury their dead and ask nato not to bomb
2692394 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot

2692410 lepaskan dia kita dengar dulu apa masalahnya kita tak perlu menghukum seseorang tanpa tahu apa perkara sebenar yang membuatkkan dia bertindak begitu islam datang membawa rahmah hukuman islam adalah pengajaran bukan penyiksaan
2692411 saya lepaskan satu gari sebagai mendengar pendapat abang dan satu lagi saya biarkan sebagai mengikut pendapat saya
2692412 kenapa awak tiba tiba menyerang meng beritahu saya kenapa awak marahkan saya

2692419 selalunya ini adalah masalah aqidah masih ada juga orang islam yang terkeliru akidahnya ah meng untuk mengenal islam perlu melalui pintunya seperti awak masuk ke sini tadi melalui pintukan begitu juga dengan islam dan pintu kepada islam adalah aqidah
2692420 ye dia mungkin ceritakan tapi mungkin juga tak sepenuhnya ramai yang belajar aqidah ini tidak sepenuhnya sebab itulah ramai yang mempertikaikan islam ramai lagi yang menggunakan nama islam namun sering menentang ajaran islam itu sendiri menentang hukum judi hukuman terhadap penzina hukum terhadap pencuri hukum riba malah hukum aurat yang ringkas itu pun

2692432 si se vende gasolina abajo del costo el estado deja de percibir impuestos y eso tambi n es una violaci n tremenda

2692500 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2692501 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2692502 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2692503 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2692504 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2692505 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2692506 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2692507 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2692514 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move

2692665 i was caught in a vicious circle from the moment i first felt any pain my initial thought was i am having a heart attack so i panicked and this caused me further distress making my day to day life unbearable
2692666 the ecg monitor has improved my quality of life beyond belief i no longer suffer from stress or panic attacks the moment i feel any chest pain i can do a cardiac self test and within a matter of minutes i know if the symptoms are related to my heart condition or not without the need of having to go into hospital it has truly changed my life
2692667 often people put down chest pain to nothing more than indigestion caused by over indulgence which will go away by itself but with many cases the pain can be a symptom of something more serious
2692668 it makes me mad that people keep comparing me to amy winehouse and dusty springfield its just labelling me as something else without any respect for the struggle the determination focus or artistic vision i have its like whoa whats that about why would i want to be someone else because i really dont i just want to be me

2692703 wahai rabbku tatkala engkau menciptakanku dengan tangan mu dan meniupkan ruh mu ke dalam diriku maka engkau mengangkat kepalaku lalu aku melihat di atas kaki kaki arsy tertulis laa ilaaha illallaah muhammadur rasuulullaah sehingga aku tahu bahwa engkau tidak menambahkan ke dalam nama mu kecuali makhluq yang paling engkau cintai

2692730 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2692731 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so

2692740 we trained sales consultants during the day and the dealerships hosted consumer events in the evening
2692741 each of the events resulted in an average of three to 10 pre orders for the mks and generated a lot of momentum around the vehicle
2692742 when we pulled the cover off of the car you could hear a pin drop
2692743 we had people who just looked at the car and said wow
2692744 educated people understand the technology in the mks and theyre excited about all of the things this vehicle can do

2692763 i can confirm the decision of georgias national olympic committee athletes and officials supported by their government that they will continue their participation at the olympic games here in beijing
2692764 that very much reflects the olympic spirit and values of the games the ioc believes this is absolutely the right decision especially for the athletes for whom this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
2692765 we have also been in touch with the russian olympic committee and they too have confirmed they wish to continue
2692766 this medal is good for georgia especially during times like this
2692767 i am very nervous today its very difficult for my people
2692768 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2692769 the georgian team lives only a few dozen yards metres away from the much larger russian team but there have been no problems
2692770 we are trying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing

2692775 it is gratifying to see the respect and recognition we are beginning to attract as a regional organization none of this could have come about without challenges and turbulence on the way
2692776 for this recent funding boost i acknowledge the remarkable initiative and drive of the new executive director bakanebo tamaroa who took over the reins in january this year and has managed to recruit a professional team to support his vision and leadership it is indeed very inspiring for me to see piango leaping ahead and to witness a strong model of teamwork
2692777 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2692778 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2692779 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2692780 due to the huge success of so you think you can dance my summer will be taken up my travels to south africa australia and canada to work on local versions of the show
2692781 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time to a new venture with simon fuller
2692782 i was working 24 7 and then some so there was no time in creating anything else
2692783 its like giving birth to a baby and letting it go just talking about it is tough
2692784 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2692785 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2692786 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2692787 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2692788 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2692789 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2692790 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2692791 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2692792 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2692793 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2692794 weve all heard that there was a bombing early this morning
2692795 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2692796 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie
2692797 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2692798 i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac
2692799 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man

2692829 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2692830 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2692831 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2692832 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me

2692836 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2692837 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2692838 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home

2692854 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
2692855 you hes been my best friend since before i knew you
2692856 is the biggest challenge you faced during your year to become miss rodeo america
2692857 a world of frogs and green fountains and flying dogs and silver cats and emerald rats
2692858 shape of things to come from the motion picture wild in the streets
2692859 its o k the person i give it to will never notice
2692860 i made a giant error one stripe is wider than one of the others
2692861 you are a disgrace to the man race its time to run like a real man
2692862 i am not homophobic im not a gay basher i didnt say anything that was negative derogatory or malicious
2692863 i would never do a commercial if i thought it was going to offend anyone
2692864 what the fuck theres people going faster than we were
2692865 if you put cold milk into hot coffee what does it turn into
2692866 you have to keep in mind some built in inaccuracy based on existing records
2692867 so their representatives averages are only as good as the er records
2692868 what surprises a lot of people are how short they times are because their er is not like that one of the problems is that we do sample ers all over the united states we do a random sample of ers and get a lot of ers that have short times and some ers that have long times
2692869 you think god that guy had to wait for 6 hours the waits you remember are the long ones
2692870 you cant say for sure why they dont go see their doctor but they do have a doctor and they do have insurance
2692871 in june 2008 it was 38 minutes for the past 12 months it was 43 minutes
2692872 thats whenever we just have no place to put them which is becoming a daily occurrence
2692873 we have days when we have to leave them on the ambulances gurneys because weve used all the recovery room beds and the er beds or sit them in wheelchairs those are the days patients will wait two or three hours ive worked in four ers in the state and its the same way everywhere
2692874 in 2001 2002 we had 35 826 and in 2007 2008 we saw 50 103
2692875 in 2002 we had a 3 2 percent increase and in 2003 we had an 11 8 percent increase in 2004 we saw a 7 5 percent rise and in 2005 we were kind of level at 0 2 percent in 2006 the increase was 3 2 percent and in 2007 6 2 percent we just keep growing and there doesnt seem to be an end
2692876 people want to be seen and in the er you can be seen 24 7
2692877 were the safety net for those who cant see their family doctors
2692878 with st lukes closing last may we have seen a significant jump
2692879 we saw a 20 percent increase overnight from april 30 to may 1 the very next day it went from 17 to 20 percent on any given month and has stayed consistent
2692880 were on track this year to see about 38 000 patients which is about 6 500 to 7 000 more patients than we saw before st lukes closure
2692881 depending on how winter goes and how the flu season hits we may exceed 40 000
2692882 what we do is look at the length of stay as a whole from the time you check in to the time you leave the department either to go home or be admitted
2692883 the average length of stay this june was 3 hours and 38 minutes but that number is kind of misleading because we have some very short stays during hours when volumes are low and we have some very long stays based on the patients illness or injury and the time of day they may present arrive because in ers our busiest times are in the evenings
2692884 really from about noon to 1 a m is our absolute busiest time of the day and we actually look at er visit times broken down in two hour increments and see how many patients are here from 0 to 2 hours 2 to 4 hours 4 to 6 hours etc
2692885 and we try to evaluate the longer lengths of stay and work on improving those time elements
2692886 what people who walk in and wait in the lobby typically dont see are the number of ambulances the traumas the higher acuity patients entering by ambulance and coming in separate entrances
2692887 we understand that everybodys personal illness or injury is an emergency but sometimes things go on in the emergency department that slows down our ability to get to those patients one of the things were really trying to do at brmc is improve the communications to people in the lobby to keep them informed of potential delays
2692888 ive worked in 15 hospitals and the answer is the same for all of them the er is the community doctors office we see rashes to common colds all the way to traumatic accidents that happen on farms and highways
2692889 were the first line of defense for everything from minor illness and injury to trauma
2692890 we are extremely proud of our newsroom and the hard work and effort our reporters editors photographers and other editorial staff members put into their work

2692892 that means the first thing is to look around their area and their home are you susceptible to flash flooding it is a very dangerous situation and it comes up really fast ask people who have been around in the community and you can assess what has happened in the past
2692893 some of those that you just mentioned there were just three or four counties that sustained big damage
2692894 something like that can happen with thunderstorms you can have just a downpour and a deluge on one mountainside and it can cause severe flash flooding so it can really be site specific that is why people need to pay attention to what is going on around them

2692896 this is what we will do if we get separated here is our plan and what we are going to do if the road washes out a part of that process is checking with the daycares and the schools to know what their plans are and dont forget the pets and whatever the special needs of children are or if you have elderly members of your family once you have a plan in place the next thing you look at is your disaster kit

2692904 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan

2692906 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
2692907 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
2692908 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006 the newspaper added
2692909 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
2692910 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
2692911 pakistani military leaders rubbished the american information and evidence on the kabul bombing but provided some rationale for keeping a window open with haqqani just as the british government had decided to open talks with some taliban leaders in southern afghanistan last year

2692978 a rapidly spinning top will precess in a direction determined by the torque exerted by its weight the preces sion angular velocity is inversely proportional to the spin angular velocity so that the precession is faster and more pronounced as the top slows down the direction of the precession torque can be visualized with the help of the right hand rule this process involves a considerable number of physical and mathematical concepts a torque is exerted about an axis through the tops supporting point by the weight of the top acting on its centre of mass with a lever arm with respect to that support point since torque is equal to the rate of change of angular momentum this gives a way to relate the torque to the precession process the expression for precession angular velocity is valid only under the conditions where the spin angular velocity w is much greater than the precession angular velocity wp when the top slows down the top begins to wobble an indication that more complicated types of motion are coming into play

2693035 so now we need to change the emphasis because the demographics of the epidemic have changed

2693038 children have been short changed in the response to aids they are visible in the photo opportunities and headlines but mostly invisible in the response to hiv
2693039 we were amazed at the actual number of infections that can be averted by expanding access to treatment
2693040 modelling suggests expanding anti retroviral therapy by 50 would lead to a 30 drop in new infections
2693041 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage with highly active anti retroviral therapy could help reduce the number of new infections
2693042 however we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment
2693043 no one is talking about treating our way out of the epidemic but by treating people you reach two objectives you save lives and prevent further infections
2693044 what is dramatic about montaners hypothesis is the tremendous boost it will give to treatment especially in africa
2693045 i spent years begging african governments to treat people to save lives if i had been able to say not only are you going to be able to keep people alive but you will reduce infection over the long run there would have been a huge inducement to rollout treatment more widely
2693046 it was difficult to get the kids excited at first with yet another ngos hiv sensitization campaign once they realized their voices would be heard across the country they got excited
2693047 reengage existing peer health groups and get teachers to start thinking about health and sexual education
2693048 the biggest threat to children in families affected by hiv is the enormously impoverishing cost of the disease
2693049 sa is exemplary with 8 million children indirectly receiving grants
2693050 given that 12 million children under 18 years of age have lost one or both parents to aids this is an astonishingly forgotten group
2693051 the plight of children surely teaches us that we need to redefine the meaning of prevention prevention not only means action to eliminate the causes of hiv infection and aids itself it also means preventing the adverse human consequences of hiv and aids on children and families affected by the pandemic it is also a sad and unacceptable fact that children living with hiv are less likely to receive antiretroviral drugs than their adult counterparts reflecting yet again the low value that society and even the aids community places on children
2693052 despite our best efforts and achievements the transmission of hiv continues at high rates in southern africa
2693053 we have to change our tactics and think out of the box
2693054 prevention should be priority number one priority number two and priority number three
2693055 africa has lacked visible leadership on hiv aids we hope this will change with the champions initiative
2693056 my own country sa was mired in the gruesome nightmare of president thabo mbekis aids denialism

2693058 someone should have told me that my children were dying from aids
2693059 i could have taken precaution while i cared for them during their illness i could have avoided exposing myself to the virus now who will care for me when i eventually fall ill from aids who will care for my orphaned grandchildren when i die from this disease
2693060 it is based on the belief that it is important to maintain confidentiality about health matters of patients if their trust or confidence is to be gained for full disclosure and proper treatment of ailments
2693061 if doctor patient confidentiality is breached then patients will simply stop seeking medical help and that becomes too dangerous
2693062 disclosure of hiv status is a double edged sword in a society like ours where stigma is rife whose rights become paramount here the patient the spouse partner or other such people providing care for the sick
2693063 we have evidence of violence on women who tested hiv before their husbands
2693064 disclosure to their husbands led to violence being perpetrated by the same husbands women are usually the first to know their status through ante natal clinic visits they are then chased away from their matrimonial home by angry husbands under these conditions of discrimination should we allow medical personnel to disclose hiv to partners without causing risk to their clients it is a dilemma facing the nation but it is time we started debating these issues and coming out with the way forward
2693065 untenable because to which of the clients multiple partners would the doctor disclose hiv status
2693066 you are assuming partners also visit the same practitioner which is wrong they may not even live in the same place
2693067 most hiv infections are through sex which is a conscious decision that individuals take one actually takes the initiative to have sex and so takes responsibility to know the hiv status of the person one is having sex with why must we burden health personnel with the obligation of disclosing bens hiv status to sibongile she should have found out herself before she even married him
2693068 men are the major drivers of hiv in the southern africa region and the challenge is for them to be encouraged to get tested for hiv instead of the current scenario where the woman gets to know her status first either through ante natal clinic visits or illness
2693069 the dilemma is that if we are going to protect the hiv infected from stigma by not disclosing their status how do we protect the care giver who is at a high risk from hiv infection because of contact with the body fluids of the sick patients they care for
2693070 for as long as we continue to hide behind the finger of confidentiality we will wipe out the care giver population because no one has told them to protect themselves from hiv infection caregivers should be informed in such a manner that they also do not discriminate or stigmatise the patient
2693071 we are in a desperate race against time in pursuit of prevention that works
2693072 if i had been able to say not only will arvs keep people alive but they can significantly reduce new infections this would have been a huge inducement
2693073 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage of highly active arv therapy could help to reduce the number of new infections we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment
2693074 although still unproven by human clinical research prep is considered one of the promising clinical interventions against hiv currently in development
2693075 this is the most critical and overdue reform in un history
2693076 and nothing demonstrates the need for it more painfully than hiv aids the virus has exploited womens lack of power at every level all the condoms doctors drugs and behavior change experts in the world cant stop it if we dont address the root causes of womens vulnerability a new womens agency has the potential to transform the un system and enhance its credibility around the world most importantly for those gathered here in mexico it would put womens voices where they belong in the forefront of the response to the pandemic
2693077 un member states can change the world by creating a powerful womens agency
2693078 its not a panacea for the injustices faced by women worldwide but it would ensure that in every issue involving women there would be a voice and a vehicle especially at country level to identify injustices and advance the struggle for womens rights
2693079 african leadership in countries where discriminatory laws and policies are still in place would later fail to control the spread of the disease among homosexuals drug users and prostitutes
2693080 it is hard to acquire statistics from countries with such restrictive laws and policies in place i think it is the responsibility of civil society organisations to help change the situation
2693081 i think one of the prevention strategies includes community based interventions
2693082 the invisibility of men who have sex with other men in many low and middle income countries across the globe is contributing to inadequate resources being given to hiv prevention programmes despite msm accounting for significant proportions of new infections in those countries
2693083 homophobia continues to fuel the spread of hiv in countries with concentrated epidemics and in countries with generalized epidemics alike
2693084 how we fare in fighting aids will impact all our efforts to cut poverty and improve nutrition reduce child mortality and improve maternal health curb the spread of malaria and tuberculosis and strengthen health systems
2693085 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most devastating infectious disease humanity has ever had to face and we have faced this disease we have rallied
2693086 the history of the response has been one of demanding action
2693087 identifying obstacles and unleashing the power to push these obstacles aside the activists set things sailing the international community stepped in to build the boat this is global solidarity
2693088 for the first time fewer people are dying of aids for the first time fewer people are becoming infected with hiv for the first time we have empirical evidence that our brilliant coalition can move mountains
2693089 this is cause for great encouragement but it is not cause for complacency and it is certainly far too early for declaring victory because the end of aids is nowhere in site
2693090 when historians look back on how the world responded to aids they will describe an unprecedented global mobilization in response to a health problem
2693091 just like condoms or faulty medical supplies bad laws can spread the virus
2693092 one doesnt know whether its holding hands kissing fondling or anything more extensive
2693093 the problem with abstinence as a means of hiv aids prevention is found in the fact that many people are not willing to abstain from sex even at the risk of acquiring the disease this is more in the case of young men and women who are more energetic and more prone to experimentation than the adult population who are somehow settled in their sex habits and are often very self regulatory in their behaviours
2693094 the youths especially the adolescents who often get excited about sex throw caution overboard taking risk in sexual behaviour that are detrimental to their health and are unhelpful in the prevention of hiv aids
2693095 the situation has gotten so bad today that some women cannot have unprotected sex with their husbands militating against child bearing happiness and trust in the home in some families some spouses nurse the same fear for their partners as they would have for commercial sex workers
2693096 some of these women complain bitterly that they married their husbands as virgins stayed faithful through their married years only to be given the gift of hiv aids by their husbands the worse cases is that some of these men on discovering they are positive hide it from their wives and start going for antiretroviral treatment leaving their wives to suffer until they have full blown aids this is a double stab because while they live on the women die and in some instances the men despite knowing their status go ahead to breed infected children instead of informing their families and taking necessary steps to protect mother and child cases abound where a man falls ill and dies only for his widows and orphans to discover months or years later what killed him when they start having the symptoms or test positive to the disease they just dont battle to fend for themselves alone any more they have to fight the disease which may have gone to a very advanced stage then leading to more avoidable deaths if only they had been faithful or opened to their families no matter how devastating the revelation might be to them
2693097 there has been a 50 reduction in risk of death and loss in hiv patients on treatment to follow up
2693098 i am a youth leader engaged in the fight against hiv aids
2693099 africa has burst into this whole frenetic spasm of criminalising hiv
2693100 criminal law is simply the wrong framework for dealing with hiv transmission
2693101 everywhere it has been tried it has been counterproductive and applied unjustly
2693102 the care action programme is designed as a long term project to assist zimbabwe a total of seven companies have pledged to assist in orphanages homes as well as schools in the country as a way of giving back to the community
2693103 the care action is a further step for us in implementing the spirit of china africa co operation where companies undertake to respond to the urgent need of assistance as part of their social responsibility
2693104 the challenges are huge but i have no doubt that we will live in a world without hiv some day
2693105 this is not a time to step away and invest less we need to move forward with big investments we have to be unafraid to fail
2693106 the persistence of hiv in latent reservoirs presents a major challenge to the ultimate goal of eradicating hiv from the human body
2693107 while researchers strive to answer this and other key scientific questions we cannot afford to squander the prevention and treatment knowledge that already exists today
2693108 ignoring the needs of children affected by hiv and continuing to marginalize groups at greatest risk for infection will only lead to more new infections and fewer people on treatment
2693109 i took an hiv aids test and was found to be positive the doctor gave me a weeks sick leave so i could go for medical attention when i told the managing director about my condition and that i would be on leave for a week he said he wouldnt work with someone who was hiv aids positive
2693110 thank you for bringing children from the streets to have a home we need more of people like you to give children hope
2693111 it doesnt matter where you are coming from where you are going is what matters the sky should be the limit
2693112 i enjoy our conversations our relationship is constructive and its important and also very candid
2693113 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2693114 we need to innovate and reinvigorate our approach to hiv focusing on prevention
2693115 our current practices are somewhat dated we need to think out of the box we need a creative new approach to catalyse country and regional level leadership
2693116 mobilise other leaders to advocate strong and effective action on prevention and dialogue on changing the social norms that constrain prevention
2693117 the champions will provide visibility of leadership on hiv there is no better leader to do this than president mogae
2693118 when my own country was mired in the ghastly nightmare of president mbekis aids denial president mogae was coming out very clearly on the importance of offering his people hiv treatment and care
2693119 you are all leaders who have transformed your countries and all the partners are tremendously excited this is african leadership creating african solutions and we are just junior partners
2693120 we know that we cannot sustain treatment and care infinitely unless we substantially reduce and arrest the spread of hiv
2693121 ive been feeling it a little bit in the last week
2693122 ive been getting treatment but as the match went on the pain started getting stronger and stronger
2693123 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2693124 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2693125 hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible

2693135 people alive when kennedy was killed usually remember exactly where they were when they heard about it i remember exactly where i was when a friend asked if id heard steve jobs had cancer it was like the floor dropped out a few seconds later she told me that it was a rare operable type and that hed be ok but those seconds seemed long i wasnt sure whether to include jobs on this list a lot of people at apple seem to be afraid of him which is a bad sign but he compels admiration theres no name for what steve jobs is because there hasnt been anyone quite like him before he doesnt design apples products himself historically the closest analogy to what he does are the great renaissance patrons of the arts as the ceo of a company that makes him unique most ceos delegate taste to a subordinate the design paradox means theyre choosing more or less at random but steve jobs actually has taste himself such good taste that hes shown the world how much more important taste is than they realized
2693136 one thing about geeks in my experience is that they dont have a lot of what david allen calls contexts or a lot of different sets of tools or opportunities theyre at the computer thats pretty much it and so for a lot of us gtd can be a just a text file all i would say is whatever you choose choose the tool that stops just short of being fun to use if its too fun to use youre gonna fiddle keep it to where you kind of dont love to use it

2693149 when the market expects something to happen the worst thing you can do is drag it out thats the real enemy they face right now
2693150 given current attrition rates the expected head count efficiencies could be achieved without significant layoffs
2693151 ultimately there will be positions that will not exist anymore
2693152 as lines of business grow there will be new opportunities
2693153 doing widespread layoffs is not who we are and its not how we do business
2693154 business owners are asking for more sophisticated analysis of their medical costs
2693155 to do that we need new equipment and we need to change staffing
2693156 if there is differences in pay scales based on differences on costs of living some of these factors have to be looked at
2693157 thats normal for any companies coming together but were not there yet
2693158 the question youre really asking with a name is what is the brands true essence the heart and soul that youre trying to communicate to your audience

2693160 the drug that changed the game was eli lilly amp co s prozac if you remember there was a book out called prozac nation
2693161 and what that means is when a drug goes off patent its really going to be the original manufacturers brand that theyre going to have to fall back on and rely on so that loyal customers will continue to demand that drug

2693171 did you know that one of our mutual funds just changed managers
2693172 lenders are not as patient as they once were to do a restructuring
2693173 want to be paid out and the fastest way to pay them out is to find a buyer
2693174 theyre sitting down with the bank and trying to come up with the best deal that they can and give their properties back to the bank and walk away with the best deal possible

2693181 the subprime market caught a lot of military families in a real lurch just like any family
2693182 when a husband or wife is deployed theres less income and less financial help available
2693183 many enlisted folks are straight out of high school and theres no financial literacy training
2693184 all of a sudden they get a paycheck every two weeks but at the same time theyre underpaid as a result they go to payday loan stores to fill the gap and get into deeper and deeper debt
2693185 everyone in military service needs to be vigilant on what kind of financial transaction theyre getting into

2693198 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2693199 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2693200 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2693201 the event has attracted massive publicity and as such we anticipate that the local police and security bureau will have beijing well locked down so that general security risks are likely to be mitigated and therefore not a major concern for the general public attending the events
2693202 we have recently seen a large backlash against china from various factions protesting about chinas human rights record who may well attempt to use the mass media coverage of the games to publicise their cause and attempt to disrupt the event should any such incident occur it is possible that attendees may be caught up and as such should be on the look out for anything they instinctively feel is not right or suspicious
2693203 consider the fact that such large crowds of visitors unfamiliar with beijing will attract pickpockets fraudsters and other petty criminals some popular scams to be aware of are offers of taxi services not from authorised taxi pick up points or requests to have a drink with a friendly local in order to help him improve his english skills
2693204 we assist with all aspects of the trip by acting as the security coordinator for our clients
2693205 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2693206 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2693207 normal markets possess all four of these features clarity conviction cash and closings
2693208 today were lucky to have one even in the depths of the rtc crisis we had motivated sellers and opportunistic buyers who could find cash they closed on some unbelievable long term investments now everyone is foggy headed we have reluctant emotional sellers and buyers are acting like carrion beetles
2693209 lenders have increased pricing to the point that nothings getting done private equity groups are loaded with cash but why invest today when prices could be lower tomorrow tenants meanwhile are at a standstill retailers are scrapping plans to expand even closing stores and who wants to commit to more office space
2693210 and that can work for both lenders and developers for now theres nothing we can do about clarity but there is cash for high quality transactions and conviction is up to the individual investors who make money in this environment will be the ones who get three of the four cs theyll secure cash and because of strong conviction theyll see their deals through to closing
2693211 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2693212 financial planning should be an integral part of the divorce process the earlier the financial advisor becomes involved the less likely the situation will escalate out of control
2693213 until recently the attorneys and mediators did it all themselves financial and emotional counseling along with the legal work
2693214 today attorneys understand and appreciate more than ever the value we bring to their practices
2693215 they can concentrate on the legal work and allow professional divorce financial planners to handle the complexity of providing financial solutions that work on a short term basis and long term as well

2693217 paypal is a safe and easy way to pay and get paid online
2693218 paypal allows anyone to pay in any way they prefer including through credit cards bank accounts buyer credit or account balances without sharing financial information
2693219 in a recent survey of customers by alwaysforme com we found that paypal was a preferred method of payment for its ease of use cited by 79 of respondents security 71 and reputation 54
2693220 over three quarters of customers surveyed use paypal frequently when shopping online
2693221 frozen sperm banks have been available for over thirty years egg freezing and thawing has been much more technically challenging nevertheless research has progressed and various options for egg freezing and banking have now arrived
2693222 frozen eggs offer women options in deciding when they wish to conceive whether with their own eggs or with donor eggs
2693223 some women have diseases such as cancer earlier in life and must delay childbearing in addition cancer treatments can destroy eggs around the world many women have chosen to bank their eggs and or ovarian tissue for future use others have opted to use donor eggs
2693224 many of our patients who use donor eggs are only in their thirties
2693225 they are often upset because no one informed them previously that ovarian aging is a serious and common problem
2693226 freezing eggs give women and couples the time and convenience of using their eggs when they are ready to get pregnant liberated from the financial personal and ethical dilemma presented with frozen embryos
2693227 egg donation is a highly successful treatment option for women who may not be able to get pregnant with their own eggs but are still able to carry a pregnancy however the process of selecting the right womens eggs often presents challenges
2693228 patients frustrated by years of tests and failures greatly value the speed and convenience of frozen eggs and will seek the procedure in greater percentages
2693229 it marks our transition from a successful start up in the emerging field of cell phone recycling into the undisputed global leader in electronics sustainability
2693230 our goal was to develop a profitable company that was socially and environmentally responsible
2693231 through the dedication of a talented team of people recellular has exceeded all expectations with igcs support and investment we will dramatically expand the company and set the standard for success in electronics sustainability and clean tech operations
2693232 they have revolutionized the electronics sustainability industry by providing a convenient solution for consumers to recycle their used handsets while at the same time extracting enough value from these phones to build a successful business we have investigated many clean tech companies including many in the cell phone recycling arena and we felt that recellular was clearly the worlds most promising cell phone reuse and recycling firm
2693233 we chose to partner with igc because of their deep knowledge of the sector their experience with growth stage companies and the value they can bring through rich networks in the u s europe and asia
2693234 we processed almost 5 000 phones in our first year of business
2693235 today we get an average of 24 000 phones enough to fill seven mail trucks every day five days a week with the support and resources of igc we see the potential to double the number of mail trucks delivering to recellular in the very near future
2693236 to learn english faster students must avoid these five common mistakes
2693237 when students stop making these mistakes they change the way they learn english they learn faster and their speaking improves almost effortlessly
2693238 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2693239 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2693240 if the legislation holds i believe we can expect two developments first there will be heightened activity in the period up to october 1st as affected homebuyers seek to lock into homes before they get sidelined and arent able to second we will see an appreciable decline in buyer activity and home sales as a result of down payment assistances elimination after october 1st buyers who could have purchased homes will have to wait or give up their search
2693241 we could see a 10 or greater decline in our already suffering housing market that potentially moves us away from a market that is recovering to one that is stinging taking this one step further i dont know how much more the broader economy could handle if a similar result took place across the united states
2693242 regardless of the side of the debate one is on the market reality is that wholesale elimination of the down payment assistance option does present a risk to the phoenix housing market its been an important enabler and i hope there is a compromise solution that congress and the president will take up before we see down payment assistance go completely away
2693243 whats the real reason that giving is declining in most churches today is it the economy
2693244 economic downturns do make religious people more conscientious about how and where they give and invest when wages are frozen commissions are smaller and prices are higher the coffers will be lighter thats a fact but the economy has very little to do with the decline in the number of coins that ring in todays coffers even when the economy was booming giving was waning giving has been declining for decades
2693245 a more important question is what motivates generosity at all
2693246 generosity is never tied to your circumstances but to your convictions if the economy had anything to do with giving the macedonians about whom saint paul wrote in sacred scripture had every reason to quarantine the meager resources they did have instead however and this is what shocked saint paul their generosity was outlandish
2693247 just as in macedonia this kind of outlandish generosity exists today
2693248 but it isnt because of sermons on tithing or the pulpit scolding of those who do not give if youre interest is in growing a spiritually healthy church motivation for giving must come from somewhere other than guilt for not giving or shame for giving too little
2693249 you never have to beg from people who have experienced grace
2693250 but you almost always have to beg from those who have not
2693251 if you find there is a decline in giving in your church look for a deficit of grace in peoples lives
2693252 it is there youll find the answers in your search for what motivates giving grace is the key that unlocks the door on the generosity quotient in a persons life
2693253 the objects we pick up and use in our daily lives from cameras can openers and computer keyboards to bread knives cheque books and tape measures are designed for right handed people and we left handers have to adapt and muddle along
2693254 international left handers day was launched 16 years ago by the left handers club and one of the reasons behind it is to encourage manufacturers to design left handed versions of their products in order to make our lives that bit easier
2693255 although there is a wide range of invaluable left handed products available via the left handed site we want to see far more choice on the market after all left handers make up 10 of the population so theres a big demand out there
2693256 its a great area and the building has the beauty and charm of century old brick soaring wood beam ceilings and ten foot tall industrial sized windows its got a real industrial chic flair and should fit our company culture well were close to the art galleries and restaurants and its a real dynamic urban atmosphere

2693261 based upon information available as of this date heres an example of how the new fha program might work
2693262 a homeowner who has spent at least 31 of their income on a mortgage has an existing high interest sub prime loan with lets say countrywide financial the loan may already be in default as is 48 of countrywides 30 billion sub prime portfolio the borrower can refinance with the new fha on a 30 year fixed rate loan at an interest rate significantly lower than any prime borrower on a conventional basis countrywide agrees to write down their mortgage to 90 of the current appraised value in exchange for a new loan guaranteed by fha the borrower presumably now has a loan that is affordable countrywide owns a loan that is fully valued on its balance sheet and the risk of default is assumed by taxpayers
2693263 the aftermath of greed get ready for the coming inflationary boom
2693264 our online business has grown dramatically over the last 12 months
2693265 we always knew that there is a huge difference in flavour between supermarket shelf coffee and high quality freshly slow roasted coffee it seems that the increase in use of domestic coffee making equipment combined with the growth of internet shopping had driven a lot of coffee lovers to our previous online store with this in mind we commissioned the development of a new high quality website that was better able to cope with growing customer demand
2693266 we hope our online presence will develop and change over time in response to customer feedback
2693267 we currently freshly roast on demand over 25 top quality world coffees which our customers can easily purchase at the new store we also have a fledgling coffee articles section that should expand over time as well as other coffee related features
2693268 a greater awareness of quality coffee is also a factor in the growth of this business
2693269 we are very excited to launch this program in support of breast cancer research and october breast cancer awareness month
2693270 we are thrilled that circus circus reno has invited us to help them in their fundraising efforts
2693271 its a great program because it fills three needs at once
2693272 first it gives employees and patrons of organizations a chance to sell old jewelry getting instant cash for unwanted outdated or broken items that have been collecting dust in a box or drawer second it recycles precious metals which helps alleviate the need for further mining and damage to the environment
2693273 it really gives companies a unique way to raise thousands of dollars for a great cause weve had an overwhelming positive response from this program so far
2693274 give the providers what they what two physicians share ways their facilities have improved provider satisfaction
2693275 as we continue to squeeze our health care dollars trying to do more with less the next great opportunity is the enhancement streamlining and integration of the entire system through investments in information technology

2693277 before medseek i had to log in to seven different systems that were difficult to navigate just to view a portion of patient information with medseek i log in once and can see all patient information by hospital and covering group from anywhere its like a virtual round
2693278 when we first looked into finding a web hosting service provider we were completely stumped the sheer number of web hosting service providers and available plans made it hard even for us to make a decision about which one to choose this site was made with the intent of making the whole process a lot easier for you than it was for us
2693279 part of what makes our sites so successful is the fact that we arent afraid to tell people who dont have a clue what theyre really getting out of the service
2693280 no this provider doesnt have a money back guarantee but they will refund any time for unused months of service details like that
2693281 we want people who visit the site to have an enlightening experience whether they know something about web hosting or not
2693282 we try to help people be able to make an informed decision about the web hosting service they choose
2693283 companies introducing new products in a fast paced industry need to move quickly to educate potential customers that education includes not only features and benefits but also budgetary pricing so customers can quickly understand if it is within their organizations budget prospects dont want to spend a lot of time researching a new product unless they think they can afford it echoquote gives them that budget information in seconds

2693286 writers are traditional souls and theyre wary of writing for the web because the web is huge and confusing
2693287 i was contacted by an online publicity company to write a block of 15 articles last week the completed seo keyword based articles were sent in five days with another two days for requested edits and additions

2693303 the subprime mortgage debacle which quickly morphed into a national homeowners crisis has also led to widespread disillusionment with the financial services industry even as american consumers have scrambled to keep ahead of plummeting real estate values and soaring energy food and health care costs the government accounting office found that in 2007 banks charged their retail customers 36 billion in fees while bankers had hoped for a stampede of unbanked into their branches what theyve actually witnessed has been a stampede out of those branches that is being led by their most desirable customers however there are kilowatt lit bright spots for banking industry bank customers may be dissatisfied with the bank branches tellers and customer service representatives but they are both energized and enthusiastic about mobile banking and their online banking experiences the challenge for banks to benchmark and implement best practices both in the u s and abroad even as bankers assess new products and go to market strategies they find the emotional and transactional disintermediation of their most profitable customers a continuing and daunting challenge as banks consider retooling their check clearing and overdraft policies the pricing of their products and mandate bank wide standards of respectful customer service to compete against the self sufficiency of the unbanked and underbanked they must carefully craft products and strategies meaningful to fully banked wounded and wary american consumers and yes even as all these challenges are on their plates bankers must monitor best in breed nonbank financial players targeting their best and most profitable customers

2693319 i felt there were a lot more star wars stories left to tell
2693320 i was eager to start telling some of them through animation and at the same time push the art of animation forward
2693321 they all got their own shows and within a year i was scoring all four
2693322 we manipulate sounds reverse pianos and mangle different bits of audio to make percussion out of little snips of sound we use singers cello for emotional scenes and sometimes a string section but more often than not its sounds we create from scratch thats an essential part of the composition
2693323 take the modern stuff keep it modern but give it a legit flourish film scores need to evolve i dont sit around and compose unless i see picture or if someone gives me a script theres something about picture when i see it i start hearing music
2693324 salutava sempre per primo era educato e affascinante peccato non averlo riconosciuto quando viveva qui
2693325 comprava soprattutto pane e pomodori mai alcolici o sigarette era garbato ma non certo socievole
2693326 noi non lo pagavamo dabic portava qui i suoi pazienti aveva a disposizione una camera nella clinica pensavo volesse usare la fama del nostro ospedale per farsi conoscere lo avremmo anche assunto ma non ha mai dimostrato capacit particolari
2693327 mi sembrava triste e infelice vestiva in modo dimesso penso non avesse neppure i soldi per mangiare regolarmente
2693328 penso fosse un bravo psicologo e psichiatra conosceva le propriet dei minerali per curare le malattie parlava perfettamente inglese e capiva il tedesco sono convinto che avesse molti pazienti allestero
2693329 non gli ho mai chiesto referenze e diplomi anche perch usava perfettamente la terminologia medica
2693330 le loro terapie sono in genere efficaci e tuttora oggetto di ricerca scientifica alcuni casi di guarigione sono sorprendenti
2693331 a belgrado ho incontrato anche il dottor dabic ne ho avuto unottima impressione
2693332 non ho accettato perch non voglio spostarmi da belgrado se sono veramente interessati possono mandare qui i soldati malati
2693333 qui a belgrado abbiamo il pi alto tasso di fertilit in europa grazie a dabic
2693334 curava gratuitamente le coppie che non riuscivano ad avere figli
2693335 ha voluto solo un dinaro circa un centesimo di euro ndr perch non mi sentissi troppo a disagio
2693336 un peccato che luomo che ho incontrato non sia esistito veramente dabic era tollerante professionale pieno di qualit io cerco di vivere una vita sana e positiva a questo punto lo voglio ricordare cos come lho conosciuto
2693337 chiedo a miei nuovi amici quelli che hanno conosciuto dragan david dabic di perdonarmi
2693338 era un uomo calmo e profondo ogni sua parola e sguardo comunicavano calore
2693339 parlavamo di cose banali ma anche di patriottismo e della serbia lo consideravo come un fratello
2693340 radovan il nostro pi grande eroe nazionale la personificazione della serbia sono stati gli americani a costringerlo a ritirarsi a vita privata e a camuffarsi da dottor dabic
2693341 a radovan piaceva stare tra noi si sentiva a suo agio ma non abbiamo mai parlato della guerra o di politica
2693342 un santo con quella lunga barba bianca ordinava caff poco vino rosso conduceva una vita modesta mi aveva detto di essere un neuropsichiatra
2693343 li ho intravisti mentre facevano la spesa alla drogheria non si sono mai scambiati effusioni non era una bella donna ma aveva stile
2693344 ha suonato brevemente in modo delizioso ci ha spiegato di aver imparato da bambino
2693345 era sempre educato non saltava mai la fila quando il negozio era vuoto scherzava con le cassiere
2693346 comprava solo frutta e verdura di qualit acqua minerale da cinque litri yogurt con pochi grassi
2693347 tutta la serbia dovrebbe essere oggi di fronte ai giudici dellaja non solo il nostro eroe radovan karadzic

2693350 ask not what your country can do for you as what you can do for your country
2693351 on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2693352 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player
2693353 the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2693354 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2693355 he is english and can play three different positions but i am talking about someone who can play on the left
2693356 as party members we must view this problem seriously and i regard umno now being in danger zone if money politics continues unabated
2693357 ive received unofficial reports that it has become rampant at all levels and it is frightening if this becomes normal practice in future
2693358 it is sad if one day the people see this problem as synonymous with umno so the situation must be corrected before the next general election
2693359 although umno has a disciplinary board it is difficult for the board to monitor and enforce the existing regulations under the present circumstances
2693360 this is because the ill has spread to all levels while the board has limited manpower
2693361 i think we need regulations like reducing testing we shouldnt be testing during the season plus longer life engines
2693362 that will reduce costs and i dont think anyone can argue that shouldnt be the way we go
2693363 formula one does need to control costs but how you actually achieve that i dont know
2693364 we have two race engines and we should possibly expand that everyone has been able to cope with it
2693365 obviously formula one needs the smaller teams in it at the moment it is incredibly competitive and were regularly qualifying well under two seconds off the quickest lap time and we do that off 120 million
2693366 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta

2693371 est en el punto de mira de eta desde hace mucho tiempo porque es el verdadero enemigo pol tico para todo ese mundo
2693372 sin olvidar a las v ctimas que eta haya ocasionado en los mundos ideol gicos sean del pp o del psoe el enemigo pol tico de todo ese mundo es el pnv se puede estar en el punto de mira sin recibir el embate personal directo y recibi ndolo de manera indirecta
2693373 hasta ahora eta no haya atentado de manera generalizada contra personas
2693374 no quiere decir que no haya actuado con extorsi n con chantaje con impuesto revolucionario mediante secuestros
2693375 aun cuando haya sido bajo la capa de haber sido un ertzaina pero eran militantes y personas se aladas del pnv a las que han asesinado
2693376 la convulsi n que provocar a dentro de su propio mundo
2693377 no despreciar a que haya una nueva generaci n en todo ese mundo que tenga ya menores ataduras incluso afectivas y familiares con lo que pudieran ser personas arraigadas en el pnv que pueda superar esa barrera
2693378 es una organizaci n terrorista que est en plena vigencia
2693379 hay terroristas que tienen vocaci n de seguir ejercitando la violencia y que aprovechar n cualquier ocasi n
2693380 por lo tanto nos tenemos que temer lo peor y tenemos que estar preparados
2693381 lo que hace es jugar a no arriesgarse nuevamente con el pp pis ndole los talones
2693382 vuelve a los cuarteles de invierno y apuesta por la estrategia de acci n reacci n
2693383 a mejor ocasi n pensando que va a venir dada por la debilidad de eta
2693384 eta salvo la iniciativa del a o 97 98 la poca de lizarra siempre ha pensado que su mbito de negociaci n es con el estado espa ol y todo lo dem s le sobra hace mal el presidente del gobierno espa ol en quedarse en la estrategia de acci n reacci n a expensas de mejores tiempos porque aqu hay un problema de normalizaci n de la convivencia pol tica y ese problema lo tenemos que resolver los partidos
2693385 del marco pol tico corresponde a las formaciones pol ticas
2693386 en el d a a d a a las pol ticas que se han de activar desde las administraciones e inciden en la vida diaria de los vascos
2693387 cu l es la l nea en la que quiere trabajar el psoe y el borrador de anteproyecto de presupuestos
2693388 si hay cuestiones que se pueden incorporar a petici n del grupo vasco
2693389 a mi me hace gracia cuando en base a ese talante que quiere reflejar zapatero dice que el gobierno espa ol va a buscar el consenso es que no tiene otro remedio tiene que elegir novia
2693390 cu les son los caminos que hay que recorrer pero dentro de esa responsabilidad y actitud absolutamente serena y sensata
2693391 y que el pp y pse han pretendido que fuera fiesta
2693392 maldita la gracia que estemos hablando de que ese d a se consulte a la ciudadan a vasca para que avale un intento de acuerdo pol tico entre las formaciones pol ticas y que quede sin valor por una decisi n del tc
2693393 el pnv despu s de los procesos que ha vivido sigue siendo un partido caracterizado por la bicefalia y son los rganos de decisi n del pnv los que tomar n las decisiones de qui nes son sus representantes
2693394 tienen por costumbre un h bito que es preguntar primero a la persona qu es lo que quiere qu es lo que piensa c mo se siente cu l es su valoraci n de lo que hasta ahora se ha hecho y cu les son los nimos con los que se encuentra de cara al futuro

2693405 the story that is going around that i was offered the presidency in 1997 and i declined is totally and absolutely untrue
2693406 i have never conceived that if i would be called upon to serve my country in the most minor of capacities i would refuse
2693407 this has gone beyond mischief i have never been associated with the paper as the or a peeping tom
2693408 i challenge anyone including the editor to disprove my denial
2693409 i have a role and a place in the ppp in which i have spent almost 50 years of my life trying to promote and develop this is my party i do not want the party to detract from the real issues of development
2693410 an opinion survey conducted in mid july by the north american caribbean teachers association nacta has found that most respondents miss watching sharmas tv station and tv viewers eagerly look forward to the resumption of programming
2693411 even government officials say they miss the station especially the popular voice of the people which has made cn sharma a household name he has become one of the most popular personalities in the country people of all backgrounds and political persuasions disagreed with the severe penalty imposed on the tv station for its infringement of the broadcasting code
2693412 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2693413 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player
2693414 impartial and vigorous investigation into the death of prisoner edwin niles and for the matter not to be treated as exempt from the normal processes of the law because the disciplined services are involved
2693415 its like i didnt know nothing that was happening i did take off my clothes and was in my bare shorts nobody never come and ask me nothing i din see nobody i was in the backdam picking my pigeon peas and i dont know if the person came from behind or what im not sure if maybe it was my condition because i only had on my shorts or that i must have been mistaken for someone they were looking for
2693416 even my girlfriend at the time told me not to go down that day but i turn and tells she that i had to pick the peas cause if they stay on and dry they could kill the tree plus i would prefer to be in there doing up my crops than be idle and my aunt did insist that i move and come up front just to avoid problems
2693417 otherwise i am usually at home when im ready i go out and i buy and sell shades and chains and so and i make my little hustle from that i am just thankful that i am alive even though i still have some pains i just dont fatigue myself too much

2693421 the bill seeks to amend the prevention of crimes act cap 9 01 so as to prevent repeated commission of crimes
2693422 at present section 3 of the act provides for subjecting persons who have been convicted of certain crimes defined in the act to police supervision only if the court having cognizance of the indictment direct the person to be so subjected to police supervision
2693423 of late it has been noticed that there has been a spate of commission of heinous offences by persons who have earlier been convicted
2693424 clause 1 of the bill sets out the short title of the proposed legislation
2693425 clause 2 seeks to repeal and re enact section 3 of the act relating to police supervision in accordance with the direction of the court in respect of persons who have been convicted on at least two occasions for commission of certain crimes
2693426 clause 3 seeks to amend section 4 3 of the act relating to the requirement of notifying the place of residence or change of residence of the person under police supervision
2693427 clause 4 seeks to insert a new section 18a in the principal act empowering the minister to amend the schedule subject to affirmative resolution of the national assembly
2693428 clause 5 seeks to insert a schedule to the act mentioning the offences referred to in the proposed section 3 2 for which supervision of the police is provided

2693432 what criminals have done is they have found a weak point and what they have done increasingly is that they started to exploit what is commonly known as the card not present route
2693433 the card not present technique is where somebody may well take your card information and persuade a retailer or a merchant to handle a transaction over the phone to buy goods
2693434 suriname is a different opponent with two very good wingers and an entirely different pedigree than our first round opponents dominica
2693435 this game will answer some serious questions about guyanas football going forward and is just what we need to evaluate what is necessary in the rebuilding process
2693436 we saw four guys making their debuts and how they perform against an opponent like suriname will give us a more realistic assessment of their readiness for international games whilst a few players have their intentions of retiring from international football at the end of this tournament which means that this game against suriname would be their farewell to guyanas football on home soil
2693437 the next round of matches will be played out of guyana and these players namely hercules pollard bishop and reynolds just to name a few have indicated to me that this game against suriname would be their farewell game for their country on home soil and they would like to say thanks to those in charge for giving them the opportunity of representing their country in a fabulous way
2693438 our finishing could be much better but as in football you do not get everything right as there is no magical formula to ensure that everything is perfect in the perfect timings but i can promise hard work and total commitment in this game against suriname leaving the result up to allah god as only he knows the secret of the future
2693439 between 12 17 m per annum yrs 2 5 and in yr 6 2013 it will be approximately g 45 m
2693440 previous privatisation processes have created ad hoc accounting processes in guyana
2693441 what you did not have was adherence under the law of how you distribute a companys assets
2693442 the coach and a participating coach who is coming in from cuba had problems with their flights coming in but we expect them shortly
2693443 without having accredited persons we would not be able to spread the game as rapidly as we need to spread the game locally and that is important
2693444 we have enough qualified persons here to help qualify coaches in the level one because it is not too technical its mostly the basics
2693445 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday lives and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2693446 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2693447 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur although the likelihood of them affecting any one individual is still very low
2693448 pauls utterly enchanted with nancy and hes already rolling the idea of marriage around in his head
2693449 he adores everything about her he thinks shes the one and told stella as much
2693450 he said what would you say if i asked nancy to be the next mrs mccartney and she joked back at least shes financially independent
2693451 the whole family thinks nancys great a vast improvement on pauls last love interest
2693452 theyve been with each other 24 7 a perfect way to see if theyre suitable for marriage pauls not about to rush into anything but hes happier than hes been for years
2693453 musharraf is required to obtain a fresh vote of confidence from parliament otherwise parliament being a sovereign and independent body has the option to exercise the right to impeach him
2693454 the people will soon get good news about the dawn of democracy in the country
2693455 parliament is sovereign and has the authority to take major decisions including impeachment of the president
2693456 i will fight to save my marriage we will try and work it out
2693457 jo is still certain that this russian girl means nothing to ronnie
2693458 she didnt even seem bothered that ekaterina went to see him

2693460 there is a very strong connection between us its electric
2693461 im delirious hes a wonderful man im totally crazy about him i love everything about him
2693462 we didnt want the stresses and pressures of a big wedding so we did it quietly and it was lovely
2693463 w rden sich privatanleger mit ihrer geldanlage nur so lange besch ftigen wie mit dem autokauf w re ihnen sehr geholfen
2693464 bei uns wirken herz und hirn zusammen deshalb treffen wir h ufig anlageentscheidungen die nicht rational sind
2693465 der h ufigste fehler anleger verlieben sich in wertpapiere sie versuchen verluste auszusitzen dabei w re das geld woanders vielleicht besser investiert
2693466 es gibt privatanleger die viel zeit und energie aufwenden um mit sonderzinskonten ein paar euro mehr im jahr zu verdienen

2693468 there are certain irreconcilables who could not be engaged you also have to do it through longer term ways of providing education for the people who might now study in radical madressahs study in schools that will teach them skills
2693469 you have to do it through the economic and social development of places like the federally administered tribal areas which are deadly poor really poor
2693470 there are elements in pakistan that one worries about and they had connections to the militants in the region but the country remains a strong us ally she added
2693471 there are also clearly efforts that we think are not working to have deals if you will or negotiated solutions to the militant problem but the point is that these militants are as deadly and dangerous for pakistan as they are for afghanistan
2693472 i think were taking a pretty bold stand and by the way the pakistanis themselves understand that they need to take a bolder stand
2693473 it makes sense for call centre workers to meet other call centre workers because they understand each others pressures and what the job is really about apart from anything else someone who works night shifts and sleeps during the day needs a partner with similar patterns of hours to socialise with
2693474 they buy the latest gadgets they eat well they go for movies at 2 am its high living high spending because they earn well and have no responsibilities this wont be compatible with someone who is cautious and wants security
2693475 even if my husband could accept this i dont want my in laws cribbing that its not in their culture for a daughter in law to go to work at night
2693476 i dont think other girls could take this mad crazy lifestyle this parallel universe i have found someone who will be doing the same hours as me
2693477 the excitement here is that were not talking about red wine any more were talking about real drugs we will make a drug to treat one disease but it will as an added bonus protect you against most of the other diseases of the western world one of the drawbacks of resveratrol is that the doses need to be large
2693478 now this paper says you can reduce it into a little pill taken once a day the chances of success in humans is estimated at 80 to 90 per cent
2693479 it has never before been necessary for any organisation to define a word that has been in common every day use so i see no reason why it was necessary on this occasion
2693480 astronomers use adjectives such as giant and dwarf to describe different subclasses of objects like planets stars and galaxies so why could pluto not remain as a dwarf planet just as jupiter is a giant planet
2693481 also around 90 per cent of the planets we know now are outside our solar system but under the international astronomical unions definition they cannot be classed as planets
2693482 sunt sigur ca motley crue se pot apara si singuri asa ca nu voi vorbi in numele lor

2693512 no quiere decir que no haya actuado con extorsi n con chantaje con impuesto revolucionario mediante secuestros
2693513 aun cuando haya sido bajo la capa de haber sido un ertzaina pero eran militantes y personas se aladas del pnv a las que han asesinado
2693514 la convulsi n que provocar a dentro de su propio mundo
2693515 no despreciar a que haya una nueva generaci n en todo ese mundo que tenga ya menores ataduras incluso afectivas y familiares con lo que pudieran ser personas arraigadas en el pnv que pueda superar esa barrera
2693516 es una organizaci n terrorista que est en plena vigencia
2693517 hay terroristas que tienen vocaci n de seguir ejercitando la violencia y que aprovechar n cualquier ocasi n
2693518 por lo tanto nos tenemos que temer lo peor y tenemos que estar preparados

2693522 eta salvo la iniciativa del a o 97 98 la poca de lizarra siempre ha pensado que su mbito de negociaci n es con el estado espa ol y todo lo dem s le sobra hace mal el presidente del gobierno espa ol en quedarse en la estrategia de acci n reacci n a expensas de mejores tiempos porque aqu hay un problema de normalizaci n de la convivencia pol tica y ese problema lo tenemos que resolver los partidos

2693525 cu l es la l nea en la que quiere trabajar el psoe y el borrador de anteproyecto de presupuestos
2693526 si hay cuestiones que se pueden incorporar a petici n del grupo vasco
2693527 a mi me hace gracia cuando en base a ese talante que quiere reflejar zapatero dice que el gobierno espa ol va a buscar el consenso es que no tiene otro remedio tiene que elegir novia
2693528 cu les son los caminos que hay que recorrer pero dentro de esa responsabilidad y actitud absolutamente serena y sensata
2693529 y que el pp y pse han pretendido que fuera fiesta
2693530 maldita la gracia que estemos hablando de que ese d a se consulte a la ciudadan a vasca para que avale un intento de acuerdo pol tico entre las formaciones pol ticas y que quede sin valor por una decisi n del tc
2693531 el pnv despu s de los procesos que ha vivido sigue siendo un partido caracterizado por la bicefalia y son los rganos de decisi n del pnv los que tomar n las decisiones de qui nes son sus representantes
2693532 tienen por costumbre un h bito que es preguntar primero a la persona qu es lo que quiere qu es lo que piensa c mo se siente cu l es su valoraci n de lo que hasta ahora se ha hecho y cu les son los nimos con los que se encuentra de cara al futuro

2693551 during the week we were all pretty honest with ourselves as players and pretty much conceding that weve been letting each down over the last few weeks
2693552 regardless of whether we won or lost i was very proud with the way the boys played and stuck together as a team
2693553 one good game doesnt really count for much youve got to do it every week
2693554 it was huge they made a break up the middle hes made that tackle and then hes turned up on the line
2693555 hes phenomenal hes been tremendous all year for us and what he did in that last five minutes is just indicative of his whole season the way he just keeps turning up and tries his heart out every week
2693556 we just didnt get a chance there we lost every 50 50 so added all together with our lacklustre energy we deserved to be beaten by a mile
2693557 theres form there so its not like no ones playing well in fits and bursts its just we need a consistent effort for four quarters
2693558 we are a workmanlike side we need to have our pressure up we need to work hard if we dont were not going to win
2693559 we are not a good enough side unless weve got everyone working hard we havent got the superstars of some teams to be able to turn it on like a switch
2693560 dit is het mooiste wat ons dit jaar kon overkomen

2693574 on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2693575 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player
2693576 the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2693577 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high

2693589 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time

2693613 one of our players is a porn star so he brought a lot of girls with him to tease calum
2693614 hes on a 50 day no sex thing and so of course all the girls are getting their boobs out and theres nothing he could do about it
2693615 issues with the structure and scope of the new government are likely to take centre stage
2693616 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
2693617 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
2693618 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
2693619 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
2693620 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
2693621 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
2693622 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
2693623 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
2693624 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
2693625 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
2693626 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
2693627 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
2693628 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
2693629 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
2693630 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
2693631 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
2693632 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
2693633 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
2693634 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
2693635 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
2693636 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
2693637 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
2693638 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
2693639 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
2693640 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
2693641 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
2693642 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
2693643 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
2693644 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
2693645 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
2693646 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
2693647 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
2693648 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
2693649 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
2693650 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
2693651 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
2693652 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
2693653 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
2693654 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
2693655 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
2693656 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
2693657 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
2693658 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
2693659 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
2693660 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
2693661 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
2693662 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
2693663 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine

2693825 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this recognition the awards are a powerful acknowledgement of our ongoing growth in the business travel sector and the premium services we provide our customers vlm airlines is dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and is continually striving to set new standards in the airline industry
2693826 despite good fundamentals we have been unable to insulate ourselves from sector developments indeed the second quarter was clearly weaker than the previous year the latter part of the year also seems difficult and the operational result for the second half of the year might dip into the red
2693827 high fuel prices and a trend towards lower ticket prices have been unsettling developments for airlines the overcapacity in the market has not allowed ticket prices to rise in parallel with costs the coming cost cutting programmes in the sector will be so severe that in countries where airlines collapse there may be demands for flight connections to be maintained for business needs using state funds
2693828 the situation in the sector may remain extremely difficult due to expensive fuel and uncertain development of demand in the second half of the year fuel costs are expected to account for around 28 per cent of finnairs turnover whereas last year the jet fuel bill accounted for a fifth of turnover
2693829 in punctuality we are again among the best of european airlines moreover the amount of baggage delays has also fallen to a third of last summers total

2693908 the worst part is it was very encouraging the way he was throwing the ball
2693909 it looked like he was back to where he needed to be he was healthy and his velocity was up and he had a good split
2693910 well continue to fight and its going to be interesting now weve got to look up theres one team in front of us
2693911 now hes confident hes attacking the zone it makes it a lot easier for us behind him
2693912 i didnt want to be responsible for our second loss in a row
2693913 i made some mistakes but i was able to hang in there and battle through i felt like i was able to pitch like myself a little bit today
2693914 we got into the situation off of logan where needed a big hit and we got it

2693916 i keep telling general manager kenny williams we got what we need
2693917 but some people make me look bad some people make me look disappointed some people make me think about what we have some players should look themselves in the mirror and be embarrassed and they should be better thats all i can say

2693927 for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
2693928 celebrities whose marriages in their intimate details become public knowledge are usually steering the attention themselves
2693929 the motives may vary leverage in the negotiation or settlement process personal revenge or publicity for publicitys sake the celebrity through his or her pr agent is usually the one opening the door settlements can easily be kept confidential its a private contract
2693930 having a client in the press can certainly boost a films numbers
2693931 look at the recent batman film with what happened to heath ledger and christian bale and now morgan freeman it didnt hurt some people definitely use divorce as a way to get some press of course most of them do not want that kind of coverage its too personal and too painful and i remember that uma thurman and ethan hawke spent a lot of time trying to keep their separation private with quite a lot of success
2693932 people sit in los angeles superior court sifting through papers and they do the same in orange county superior court where whitney houston and bobby brown went thinking they could keep their divorce quiet
2693933 if you have any hint of contention in those papers anything salacious or possibly scandalous or if theres a big pre nup involved then there can be trouble
2693934 judges can be made to handle the whole case so those involved dont even have to go to court
2693935 after the petition is lodged all negotiations can take place behind the scenes and the settlement will never be announced in open court it usually suits both sides to work that way often a celebrity will have a pre marital agreement that guarantees the spouse far less than he or she would normally be entitled to but if they agree to keep quiet they can profit financially from the deal its a useful bargaining chip
2693936 in america right now the mainstream papers have a very high church attitude to this kind of news
2693937 its completely different to the uk where theres a highly competitive newspaper market

2693954 me having been on the other side of the rivalry seeing all the past outfielders tonight having barry come out the energy seemed to be up the energy in this game tonight was like the energy i remember as a dodger playing against the giants
2693955 anytime you get an opportunity to have a walk off game winning hit those are some of the most exciting moments in your career
2693956 thats stuff you dont forget almost every player remembers all his walk off hits this one was special with the dodgers being here in front of all of our fans
2693957 that was a big win for us we havent had too many come from behind wins like that at home hopefully we can build on that tomorrow

2693964 it is a neck and neck race between 2007 and this year over the issue of ice loss said mark serreze of the united states national snow and ice data centre in boulder colorado
2693965 but the beaufort sea storms triggered steep ice losses and it now looks as if it will be a very close call indeed whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for ice cover over the arctic we will only find out when the cover reaches its minimum in mid september
2693966 when we did the first climate change computer models we thought the arctics summer ice cover would last until around 2070
2693967 it is now clear we did not understand how thin the ice cap had already become for arctic ice cover has since been disappearing at ever increasing rates every few years we have to revise our estimates downwards now the most detailed computer models suggest the arctics summer ice is going to last for only a few more years and given what we have seen happen last week i think they are probably correct
2693968 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic ice
2693969 the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years and when that happens there will be consequences

2693993 i was opening up a new file in painter today and started thinking about that little color wheel it shows you the standard computer color wheel with all the colors in the wheel and the brightness and darkness controlled by a slider on the side i noticed that the blue and red seem to have the illusion of spokes of more intense color poking into the wheel and the teal purple and yellow appear to have light spokes poking out of the wheel only the green just looks nearly flat all the way across if you desaturate the whole wheel all the tones are perfectly even any idea why this is

2694123 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2694124 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2694125 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2694126 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2694127 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2694128 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2694129 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2694130 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2694131 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2694132 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2694133 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2694134 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2694135 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2694136 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2694137 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd

2694142 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2694143 we thought it would be better for him to get on the bus because its a far drive

2694146 cops use tasers more than diggers use tired memes what will it take for this disturbing trend to reverse itself
2694147 a 2002 company study found that nearly 85 percent of people shocked with tasers were unarmed fewer than 5 percent were carrying guns
2694148 a 2002 study in greene county mo found that tasers were only marginally more effective than pepper spray at restraining suspects pepper spray worked in 91 percent of cases while the taser had a 94 percent success rate
2694149 if we get a call that there is a police officer coming into our trauma ward we immediately know well need a catheter from the pediatric ward

2694151 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2694152 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2694153 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2694154 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2694155 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established

2694161 row is not between jammu hindus and kashmiri muslims as branded by some section of the media but rather a fight of nationalist forces against separatist elements
2694162 you can see hindus sikhs and even muslims out on roads to support the movement
2694163 its a movement of four lakh kashmiri pandits who are bearing the brunt of being refugees in their own country for over 19 years and its a movement of every indian who consider jammu and kashmir as integral part of india
2694164 this public outcry is to throw out each and every separatist out of this country so that people of jammu and kashmir and rest of india could shun fear forever and live in peace and tranquillity

2694190 thank you for your perspective from the womens studies department
2694191 how much money do you save every year by not shaving your legs and armpits
2694192 both muslim and jews follow their laws and disregard ours
2694193 what they really should be discussing is how to better please the men in their lives if they would learn to be better in the sack keep the house tidy and cook a few good meals they might have more influence over the true leaders in this society men
2694194 and was one of my better ones if i do say so myself
2694195 i see it as a weird kind of psychological experiment finding and pushing peoples buttons is the challenge that makes it fun i can argue either side of a topic and there are certain key words phrases for certain issues that are guaranteed to get a reaction
2694196 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
2694197 broads dont have the mental fitness necessary to be a priest
2694198 writers and editors have become obsessed with comment tallies even if many dont deign to read the comments themselves
2694199 nobody would tolerate if at the end of meet the press a bunch of weirdos stormed the studio and started screaming weird racist stuff
2694200 i should have the right to express myself without being personally attacked
2694201 i would need a whole team of people to track all the comments that come in and try to verify the author
2694202 you look at them and you go gosh you guys are really in a bad way
2694203 some people are so twisted in their hate i wouldnt open myself up for somebodys hate
2694204 people will take advantage of others bullying and saying and doing things they wouldnt otherwise do
2694205 who knows that could be your little old lady neighbor next door
2694206 no importa se dijo el potro alegremente ir a ver un empresario de espect culos y ganare lo suficiente para vivir
2694207 yo puedo correr ante el publico dijo el caballo si me pagan por ello no se que puedo ganar pero mi modo de correr le ha gustado a algunos hombres
2694208 sin dudad sin duda le respondieron siempre hay alg n interesado en estas cosas
2694209 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2694210 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2694211 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2694212 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2694213 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2694214 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2694215 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2694216 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2694217 all wildlife species are susceptible to a variety of illnesses parasites viruses bacteria and some of them are transmittable
2694218 with almost all diseases theres considered to be very little concern about bringing back parts of dead animals meat that a hunter may bring back
2694219 theyre being brought back to be eaten theyre not likely to be brought into contact with another live moose somewhere here
2694220 we havent seen a case similar to newfoundland where you have a case of multiple animal problems in a single area we get reports of moose acting strangely and our district staff will go out and investigate
2694221 i get off the plane in hawaii today and the world is saying my management team said blah blah blah siiiiiiggghhhh i told the media you cant make up lies about me because i have a media outlet myself oh and sidebar i dont know if everyone has realized this yet but i dont do interviews if theres anything i wanna say ill say right here on my own blog
2694222 this is the maddest i ever will be im typing so
2694223 the glock the gat the nine the heaters see i be bustin caps like my amp be bustin speakers
2694224 dope song dope video but also gossip about the videos players as if they were all friends one note a desperate plea for emotional support reads as if it were for west alone its worrying actually a sad girls lament about a cruel boyfriend
2694225 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2694226 improve results and get more gold medals for the nation
2694227 the motherland is above everything strike for gold in the olympics
2694228 there will be no champion if one does not go through the ultimate pressure
2694229 the coaches can be very dictatorial issuing orders to athletes without explaining why
2694230 some also get angry with us and say were meddling that athletes should just follow their orders
2694231 they need to calm down not see this as the beginning or end of their life but a step along the way
2694232 the chinese are too serious they think the sky will collapse if they lose
2694233 i always missed my family but my coach brought me up and we were closer than he was with his own children
2694234 we need to do more to consider them an overall human being
2694235 hes a well polished opponent and i beat him by more than 10 points
2694236 its going to be tough all the way but ill stick it out
2694237 im in a tough draw but ill battle it out and do the best i can
2694238 it was a mature performance from the youngest member of our team a tremendous performance
2694239 my team members were a little nervous and some players lost the opportunity to score
2694240 therefore we have to resolve the problem in the shooting circle so that we convert opportunities
2694241 the main issue is how to make the best of the opportunities within the shooting circle many of them got the opportunity we also have to make sure that the senior players are kept fresh
2694242 they do not know what is friend they would rather have angry enemies than real friends
2694243 russia can have at its borders only enemies or vassals
2694244 hardened professionals and their primary strength lies in their being completely unconflicted
2694245 the primary difference is that on the level of criticizing other blogs and bloggers they can actually do some damage
2694246 will be fine the skate blade cut his exterior jugular not the interior or he would have died
2694247 we were born naked there is nothing wrong with it
2694248 dear god you owe me a woman and since you are taking your time about paying off if you even intend on following through at all i am going to spend my time in my own selfish way gratifying myself where i want and with whom i choose
2694249 hey i look just like that why is he looking at her
2694250 oh i see i dont have a body like that thats what you really want
2694251 oh i dont need your i d if you put one over on me for that amount then god bless you
2694252 ok good to have seen you i need you to go home its not you its me i need some time alone
2694253 so your dogs have more rights than these children do if anything shut your dogs up so my kids wont scream

2694281 el secretario general est alarmado por la escalada de las hostilidades en georgia que ha dejado grandes cantidades de v ctimas y una destrucci n masiva en osetia del sur y otras regiones de georgia

2694287 lamentablemente mi conclusi n es que va a ser muy dif cil si no imposible encontrar puntos de coincidencia suficientes para elaborar una declaraci n conjunta
2694288 a estas alturas el tripartito y ciu deber an haber acordado el no a los presupuestos del estado si no hay un buen acuerdo de financiaci n
2694289 zapatero pasar a la historia por ser el presidente m s falso de los que ha habido en el estado espa ol por prometer una cosa y hacer la contraria
2694290 yo creo que ayer el se or montilla incurri en un exceso verbal pero en cualquier caso y a pesar de ello el gobierno va a seguir trabajando por acercar posiciones por buscar m s los puntos de acuerdo que de desacuerdo
2694291 recorrer en dos a os el camino que no se ha recorrido en veinte
2694292 la disposici n del gobierno para seguir dialogando y negociando y llegar a un acuerdo que beneficie a los ciudadanos de catalu a y a los ciudadanos del resto de espa a
2694293 estamos preocupados pero estamos tranquilos porque utilizaremos nuestra firmeza y nuestra fuerza
2694294 los partidos catalanes se cre an que hab an recibido un cheque en blanco con el estatut pero se han dado cuenta de que es un cheque sin fondos no hab a nada en el banco
2694295 la financiaci n debe alcanzarse a trav s de un acuerdo com n de todos los partidos y una negociaci n multilateral de todas las comunidades
2694296 dicen que no es un refer ndum que no es vinculante y que es respetuosa con la constituci n entonces para qu tal consulta para qu tanto ruido
2694297 sus captores en cualquier caso probablemente confiaban en que el tormento del joven gasteiztarra fuera a n m s largo y crudo pero el juez de la audiencia nacional santiago pedraz levant la incomunicaci n en una decisi n desgraciadamente ins lita cuando de un detenido vasco se trata y los planes de los guardias civiles que ten an en sus manos a hern ez se vieron parcialmente frustrados
2694298 el gobierno es diferente se hace menos fotos y trabaja m s
2694299 ser muy dif cil si no imposible encontrar puntos de coincidencia suficientes para elaborar una declaraci n conjunta
2694300 varios miembros del consejo expresaron su firme apoyo a los esfuerzos de mediaci n internacionales particularmente los de la organizaci n para la seguridad y cooperaci n en europa y la uni n europea
2694301 se comprende que los cuatro partidos catalanes lamenten el incumplimiento del plazo incluso que critiquen las dilaciones que puedan ser imputables a la administraci n central pero un acuerdo es siempre cosa de dos har a mal el ejecutivo de zapatero en minusvalorar el malestar catal n no s lo del gobierno sino tambi n de la oposici n el empresariado y su sociedad civil pero har an pero los dirigentes catalanes si olvidasen que en el pacto est el xito y se colocaran en la tesitura de convertir la tensi n en enfrentamiento contribuyendo as a la inestabilidad por ejemplo bloqueando los presupuestos ser a tirar piedras tambi n contra su propio tejado
2694302 el plante de los socialistas catalanes ha envalentonado y radicalizado m s a n a ciu que ayer no dudaba en afirmar que el presidente zapatero pasar a la historia como el m s falso de espa a por prometer una cosa y hacer la contraria
2694303 creemos que esta estrategia es un error porque al tratar de escurrir el bulto el gobierno y el psoe dan a entender que no hay argumentos que oponer a las bravatas del psc y al victimismo nacionalista
2694304 justo hace dos a os advert amos de las peligrosas consecuencias
2694305 mencion bamos expresamente el cap tulo de la financiaci n
2694306 rodr guez zapatero abri la caja de los truenos y ahora no sabe c mo encauzar un asunto que se le va de las manos salv el estatuto cuando estaba al borde del fracaso impuso a montilla frente a maragall y prometi un desarrollo estatutario r pido y completo a las primeras de cambio ha tenido que dar marcha atr s y tal vez ahora prefiere esperar al pronunciamiento del tribunal constitucional sobre aspectos tan discutibles como la financiaci n y las relaciones bilaterales
2694307 el psoe quer a atraerse a erc y ahora ha conseguido que sus propios compa eros catalanes adem s del sector soberanista de convergencia se desplacen hacia posiciones extremas en plena crisis pol tica y econ mica el gobierno tendr que afrontar con eficacia el desaf o catalanista que l mismo ha provocado
2694308 a la espera del fallo del tribunal constitucional sobre el mismo estatut de rebotes imprevisibles asistimos sin duda a la negociaci n de mayor trascendencia entre la generalitat y el gobierno central que ha tenido lugar en los ltimos a os la sociedad catalana est ahora junto a sus pol ticos porque lejos de abstracciones ha entendido que el progreso del pa s no puede desvincularse de la suficiencia financiera de la generalitat el futuro concreto de m s de siete millones de personas tiene que ver con este debate
2694309 en esta crisis subyacen las contradicciones de la pol tica internacional el kremlin con gran cinismo apadrina a los separatistas osetios mientras reprime a los chechenos y pese a que se opuso en marzo a la declaraci n unilateral de independencia de kosovo ee uu y bruselas por su parte alentaron y apoyaron la secesi n de la ex provincia serbia cuyo caso es considerado un ejemplo para osetia del sur mientras ahora defienden la integridad territorial de georgia occidente afronta en el c ucaso las consecuencias de su irresponsable incoherencia
2694310 es necesario aprovechar este primer y sangriento chispazo para imponer una soluci n que no desestabilice a todo el c ucaso
2694311 ari liep een paar keer goed weg en gaf een assist op de zeeuw wat vandaag wat minder ging is dat we een paar keer slordig waren bij dode spelmomenten van iraklis
2694312 i wanna tell ya with me ya dont get house soul hip hop techno jazz break beat or broken beats with me ya get nuthin but tha funk tha funky funk funk funk
2694313 i can only do what i do musically detroit has in the past produced a lot of forward thinking people a lot of the music that breaks through and changes the way things are detroit has done a lot from when you look all the way back to motown maybe not right now but its done a lot
2694314 i have been using those programmes for the last year and it helps me perform when im djing as i dont have to worry about records getting lost
2694315 i started using records again and it made it very interesting for me rather than just sitting in front of my computer it allowed me to strip a record down and rebuild it to make it more complicated
2694316 you know this cd is only coming out only in europe and all ive been thinking about is whats gonna go on there in what order yknow i must have listened to the selections like a hundred million times and it looks like ive got it
2694317 we had a long list and there was only fifteen tracks to put on i would have loved to have had some underground resistance on there
2694318 nah i do still have a lot of my equipment my prophet 5 and prophet 600 pro 1 juno 106 and 101 i do use a digital mixer and a computer on my tracks though a lot of people have been using reason and ableton a lot of great records have come out that way totally from the computer but i think because i started in a different time and with a different mentality i cant convert to ive seen a lot of people try and they lose their sound
2694319 any sampler i have the sampler is most revolutionary piece of gear designed since the modular synthesiser you know a lot of people collect records some collect gear some collect cars when todd terry came out with tracks like royal house it changed how people listened to house music public enemy changed the face of all urban and electronic music by sampling james brown i view that stuff then as them putting together a collage rather than a piece of music i can listen to it takes a nation of millions to hold us back and fear of a black planet and those records are still great works of art with samplers you could use a regular rhodes c chord and play it on the keyboard and create new ideas which is easier than just sitting over a keyboard when you dont know how to play
2694320 well i did some stuff with basic channel back around 1997 and neither of us could figure out how to finish the tracks so i guess thats like the miles davis and hendrix record or the miles davis and prince record that never was for some
2694321 a lot of the people id really like to work with are dead ive worked with a lot of fantastic artists and will continue to do so
2694322 well the new record will be the sound of me out on the street accosting people
2694323 not really i have no regrets its all part of growing as a musician as an artist as a man
2694324 well i like to keep a low profile so youll know when its in the stores
2694325 yeah ive played so many places any type of crowd from ultra commercial to the real underground places i suppose it just determines the club i wouldnt say fabric is commercial its kinda difficult because fabric is the only been place ive been playing in the uk for the last few years and its hard to say because it all depends on the crowd they attract it seems the people they attract there are really into the music
2694326 well i love playing everywhere if you go to i love techno parties in gent belgium those are gonna be more based around how its always been more old skool fuse club stayed the same as well but its not all like that in europe theyre still getting excited about the new music maybe its cuz they havent gone through so many phases as much as here yknow one day itll be techno next day intelligent techno next progressive house next this next that then its trip hop theres been so many categories created in such a short time that people got disillusioned by it all some got very excited but a lot did lose interest now in germany and belgium they enjoyed it because there werent so many labels if you were at a heavy techno night and played some jazzy house you might get a little back flack but those intricate differences in just a word changing the mentality of how people view the music didnt mean as much
2694327 well those guys envisioned it different from what i did by being a professional sampler myself i heard music differently whether it be a one beat bar or a two beat bar or just a sound so i made what i made and these guys took it on to the next hypes uh i mean heights those guys were innovative for what they did and it became a global sound for them however i just made bug in the bassbin im not gonna sit here and say give me respect those guys like roni dego and goldie made and pioneered that sound
2694328 i love to see those guys i did a festival with dego in portugal played with roni in eastern europe somewhere havent seen goldie in a while though

2694525 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2694526 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2694527 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2694528 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2694529 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2694530 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2694531 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2694532 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2694533 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2694534 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2694535 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2694536 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2694562 under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2694563 we saw the impact of the air strikes buildings on fire we could hear the russian jets above us
2694564 in one air strike the pilot missed the intended military base instead hitting two apartment blocks
2694565 when we arrived flames were pouring out of the buildings and people were still trapped inside
2694566 a woman begged the firemen and soldiers to help find her family she said shed gone into the burning apartment block but had not been able to find them
2694567 we saw injured civilians being pulled from the buildings we saw at least one man pulled out dead
2694568 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2694569 ossettia is georgias territory it has been undermined by terrorists funded by moscow
2694570 this is because russia wants to punish georgia for its democratic stance and its western ties at the moment there are between several hundred and two thousand people dead this conflict is not ethnic its not religious its about russia wanting georgia to be subordinate to them
2694571 it is vital for leaders on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2694572 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2694573 in order to consider withdrawal of our forces we must make sure that there is no chance of genocide there
2694574 there is a straightforward way to stop fighting to stop killing for georgians to withdraw and then to have an agreement on non use of force signed and then we can talk on other verity things including on military and political arrangements
2694575 certain georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia
2694576 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2694577 all of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions
2694578 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2694579 maybe it will be quiet in the future im an optimist
2694580 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2694581 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2694582 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2694583 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2694584 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2694585 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2694586 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2694587 georgias actions are criminal whereas russias actions are absolutely legitimate
2694588 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are obviously a crime it is a crime against its own people first and foremost
2694589 a deadly blow has been struck on the territorial integrity of georgia itself which implies huge damage to its state structure
2694590 the aggression has resulted in numerous victims including those among civilians and has virtually led to a humanitarian catastrophe
2694591 time will pass and the people of georgia will give their objective estimations to the actions of the incumbent administration
2694592 it is based on an attempt of the georgian administration to get other countries involved in its bloody affairs
2694593 in accordance with international agreements including the agreement of 1999 russia does not only execute peacemaking functions but is obliged in case one party breaks the cease fire agreement to defend the other party which is exactly what we are doing in case with south ossetia
2694594 we perfectly realize what world we live in today we will strive for fair and peaceful solutions of all conflicting situations which we inherited from the past

2694668 the program has been under wraps for six months but with the attention to mobile device security new mobile devices and considering how companies are trying to save money on energy lately we felt it was time to announce the initiative
2694669 last year in the us alone there was 67bn invested in start ups its a huge amount of capital and its high risk
2694670 but there is no quantitative modelling being done to help inform those decisions those decisions are being made by humans meeting each other and making a decision no other industry of that size operates in that way
2694671 some of the predictions are within a stones throw of accurate
2694672 we respect a simple rule our freedom stops where others begins
2694673 the system implemented in a country such as lebanon is really good major brands that are respectable and accountable cannot afford any cheap provocation anyway and small brands with no equity are kept from disturbing the country
2694674 we get an answer within two hours and we usually have no more than five rejections and five modification requirements per year
2694675 its usually not a blatant flat out rejection i used to work in saudi arabia where they would hand us a booklet telling us precisely what we could and couldnt do here its more like guys be careful this might cause an issue so we anticipate any time we feel we have something racy or controversial we have a sense of what will or wont pass so we call them and ask if it can fly or not
2694676 the cleavage was showing slightly too much so we had to play with it to get it to pass through censorship
2694677 beyond sex and religion we can pretty much put anything out there given all the dynamics lebanon is a good place to communicate and do advertising

2694684 bitch drink the rest of that you know we dont waste
2694685 ok now slowly get off the bike put your hands behind your head and slowly walk behind the bike and turn around and face us
2694686 i that i am gonna take care of you tonight i want to see you treated well and
2694687 your crazy candice may i swear you are never gonna get married
2694688 when you reach an advanced age and look back over your lifetime it can seem to have had a consistent order and plan as though composed by some novelist events that when they occurred had seemed accidental and of little moment turn out to have been indispensable factors in the composition of a consistent plot so who composed that plot
2694689 i could have missed the pain but id have had to miss the dance
2694690 if you dont stand for something youll fall for anything
2694691 chief executive tony scholes is over in spain speaking to the player at the moment but that doesnt mean he will be signing for us
2694692 he is a player with great pedigree and has an outstanding goalscoring record but he isnt the only player we are looking at
2694693 there is a lot going on behind the scenes and i am desperately hoping we can get at least a couple in before the bolton game next week
2694694 we are working tirelessly trying to get players in and there are quite a few irons in the fire at the moment but we will not sign someone for the sake of it
2694695 i am not talking about players who belong to other clubs
2694696 what is clear is there are a lot of right backs currently available we have had a lot of calls as a result of luke moving on
2694697 we have a good idea of what we would like and we are confident we can do some business before the start of the season
2694698 when luke became aware of villas offer he expressed the wish to move on and i dont want to have to fight to get players to want to play for this club
2694699 in any case this was a fantastic deal for the club for a player of his age
2694700 thats the thing everyone feeds off each other and you put a lot of pressure on the pitchers
2694701 when you look up and down our lineup and everyones clicking youre going to score a lot of runs and we have it all going right now
2694702 after vladdys home run im like ok we got our one run now lets battle then we just kept scoring and it was fun to watch
2694703 edwar wasnt making the quality pitches weve seen him make all year
2694704 hes been very good for us and we needed him to bounce back i believe he can get anyone out when he makes his pitches yes hes had two blips in the last nine days against the angels but i know hes better than that
2694705 you feel terrible for giese because the kid pitched great
2694706 he did nothing except what we asked him to do hes got a limit of 85 pitches and he gives us six innings and shuts down a very good offense except for one home run by teixeira
2694707 ive won one championship and before its over id like to get another ring i dont rule out anything
2694708 i can be in the outfield and play every day i dont want to dh i dont feel like a baseball player when i dh i dont know how to be the leader that i am from the bench i cant be a vocal leader i cant talk to guys from the bench because i dont feel right about it
2694709 im in a role now where i dont know what to do really the guys are out there busting their butt for nine innings they come in and they hit and they grind i just sit down and hit thats all i do so i cant be in a leadership role from that position
2694710 my thing is im going to do what ive done in the past whatever opportunity presents itself im going to look at it
2694711 i dont prefer platooning here but i understand because i got off to a slow start thats part of it but i feel im playing better now im back to being a threat i need to be
2694712 i dont get pitched the same like everybody else i get pitched very carefully now that im a lot better physically i can handle tough pitching i can be the player that i know i am
2694713 i just gutted it out and played they just told me what i was doing is unheard of i had a torn labrum and a grade 2 separation they had to shave the bone in my shoulder when i fell on my elbow last july four pieces of bone chip fell off
2694714 i got the surgery in november so i had january and parts of february to get ready they told me if it was a pitcher his career would be over
2694715 they work it down and away or up and in and its always on the edges
2694716 thats how im getting pitched but i can handle that
2694717 they picked up my option so i wouldnt wind up there i would have loved it because i love that atmosphere it means something
2694718 at this stage of my career i want to feel that again thats what i play for thats what gets me revved up
2694719 its been disappointing when we pitch we dont hit when we hit we dont pitch you cant win championships that way
2694720 look at tampa bay when we played them recently there was one reason why theyre having the year they are pitching and defense weve got to be able to finish off games that were winning
2694721 we were at mannys house when the trade went down and theyre asking manny what number he wanted
2694722 no 24 was taken and no 42 was not available he was thinking no 34 in honor of big papi but that wasnt available they text back a list 28 33 50 65 94 95 96 so manny turned to me and asked you pick a number
2694723 at first i thought no 66 after route 66 but then i said why dont you take my number i always wear no 99 he said ok lets do it thats how manny chose no 99
2694724 if thats what we need to do wed do it but manny has just told me hes happy to be in la and wants to lead them to the world series
2694725 im just pinching myself because its been a year and a half and i spent so much time rehabbing and taking all the small steps you need to take to get back healthy and to be able to get back on a major league mound and throw and throw effectively is a blessing for me i mean that when youre a major league pitcher sometimes you go along every day and of course you always appreciate what you have and what youre able to do but when its taken away from you thats quite a shock
2694726 well i mean thats pitching coach dave duncan ive never been around someone who has such a system in place where each guy is out in a position where he can succeed hes just got volumes of material and things that he stresses to each and every pitcher you can go right down the line of pitchers hes helped take the next step in their careers and that was certainly the case with me after my toronto years
2694727 i was supposed to go 80 pitches in my last start but i got only 50 in because we had some rain that cut things short so im not sure that im going to take the next big jump or whether im just going to get to 80 pitches and thatll be it for this time out that remains to be seen but im sure dave and tony la russa have a plan that ill stick with for gradually building back up
2694728 not at all weve been lucky enough here in st louis that weve been in races before and we know how to handle them and how to react to the pressures i mean this is a huge series for us because this is our big rivalry chicago st louis isnt quite yankees red sox but pretty close its our version of that so theres always a little extra going on especially here at wrigley
2694729 hes a solid player with good skills in every aspect of the game i would much rather have bay than nady who is too inconsistent for me
2694730 nady is far more talented he has the potential to be an impact player while bay is a good solid everyday player but i just dont see any more upside in him he is what he is which is a good player but nady could make a greater impact
2694731 he might be a terrific starter but as a future closer hed be absolutely incredible every organization has to do what they feel is best for them i felt the same way about joba chamberlain why mess with what that kid can do at the end of the game
2694732 i think its something i would love to do at some point in my career but its not anything you can force
2694733 i think ive prepared myself for it when and if the time comes ive learned an awful lot from tito and being in this environment i can tell you that
2694734 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2694735 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2694736 this is definitely necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea
2694737 a sea blockade of georgia will also help avert an escalation of military activity in abkhazia
2694738 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2694739 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2694740 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2694741 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders

2694749 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2694750 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2694751 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2694752 no one here cares if you go or you stay i barely even noticed that you were away ill see you or i wont whatever
2694753 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2694754 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2694755 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2694756 i am the candy wrapper of a reeses peanut butter cup my appearance is the only secret to the flavor and as such i am the origin of the smile that arises after the reeses crosses the great barrier of ones mouth and the chocolaty peanut butter communes with a lapping drooling tongue zion without me the clever and wonderful packaging there would be no relationship you would know nothing youd be nothing especially you mr knorrs you are nothing you are not even the shit that squeezes out of the asshole of humanity after being digested for this too is a joy which can only belong to the power of my calculated appearance
2694757 but the taste oh the sweet rich creamy taste and to know of and to anticipate this taste is as an origin and end sensations themselves reaching into themselves oh you are so clever my demented little friend
2694758 oh the joy of a reeses peanut butter cup but this delicious awareness that rises above us regardless of the futile attempts of dispicable vermin like yourself always begins and ends in there is never any denial or acceptance but only the tastes the smiles the hate the feelings and emotions as the packaging delivers them as they are anticipated in every calculated move i make
2694759 you believe for a moment that that flavor is yours to behold and to savor you believe it is you that knows what flavor is but this is only arrogance pride and ignorance and you stand there at this alter as though you have something to offer and to sacrifice that you are the embodiment of something eternal
2694760 we are gathered here today because of a reeses peanut butter cup
2694761 i can only imagine that if the whole world were to buy your story maybe from that mass of neglect only ten persons would and could understand what youre about and perhaps from those ten five would enjoy your scam and of those five people im sure that one day you will all meet in a sanitarium somewhere or a prison and there you will rejoice in the simple fact that you made it to the other side to a place where those who never belonged are left to decompose like dog shit on an unkempt suburban lawn maybe youll flush a bar of soap down a toilet together in the confines of your padded rooms and then sit and watch as the shit backs up there youll rejoice in being restrained together and in being unfit for the normal and the good world in which you never belonged the magic to a reeses peanut butter cup is only in the packaging there is no joy in great poohbah but only in its packaging either the whole package or the individual wrapped portions welcome to you will be punished for your little act of rebellion for i am eno modgnik and i am the only champion you are perverse and criminal and your beliefs are nothing more then deceptive fantasy and as such they belong to fools
2694762 i am perverse and i am insane i am the smile delivered by the sweet taste of a reeses but i am not the wrapper falling to the ground spreading waste and defiling the joy revealed in the smile i am the child sucking out the cherry flavored coke from great poohbahs jiggly plastic two liter titties but you have always been the trash the left over waste pretending to be the prize and trying to destroy everything of flavor and taste and did i hear you right you are the shit squeezing out of the asshole of humanity ha there have never been truer words spoken
2694763 i might be a jester in the kingdom of fools but you really should stop confusing me with falou
2694764 well ill let one of you monqs check him out and if hes not hes all yours you can give him the mouth to mouth cpr and the whole shebang cop a feel for all i care

2694778 there were some good performances it was slipping away from us but we came back and kept it up
2694779 we are still unbeaten and if we can stay unbeaten at the end of the season it will have been a great result
2694780 staffordshire are a team that has frustrated us in a past
2694781 we should have beaten them in the year we came close to winning the title and it cost us the league

2694790 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
2694791 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2694792 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the
2694793 this will be nothing like that game things are different now and we have the chance to win
2694794 weve had good preparation for the pre season and now we really want to win this first match at
2694795 of course we will approach this game very differently to nigeria we have to be a lot more committed we have to play and work hard and make sure we do our best

2694805 but in the initial stages before the game has opened up you want your best decision makers your best distributors and your best tacticians on the field
2694806 its just downright nasty watson is a bok like it lump whatever but give the guy the respect he deserves and get behind him on match day the least you can do is give him an honest assesment based on how he played not his dad his walk or his tight shorts
2694807 including full arm rather than short arm penalties for all infringements

2694875 we certainly will be impressing on our athletes through their sports section managers that when their competition finishes and they go downtown it would be wise to be branded

2694929 im going to play the guy who makes the best decisions with the ball
2694930 weve had to accelerate what weve done with the guys on a daily basis jase was the most experienced guy that we had
2694931 i cannot thank you enough for such an amazing trip the awesome sights accents hilarious stories and irish craic are something i will never forget 3 days just was not long enough all the best
2694932 o body swayed to music o brightening glance how can we tell the dancer from the dance
2694933 very few writers really know what they are doing until theyve done it
2694934 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2694935 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2694936 i tend to not really get nervous when im out on a tennis court but today was a little different
2694937 its about as humid as ive ever played in and i live in
2694938 its pretty sticky youve got to keep your wristbands on and youve got to keep going to the towel
2694939 when i was changing sides there was plenty of sweat droplets on the court from chris as well
2694940 we certainly will be impressing on our athletes through their sports section managers that when their competition finishes and they go downtown it would be wise to be branded
2694941 i had a new school every year for eight years
2694942 it was hard she was a single mom her absent father was in the air force then in jail working all the jobs she could but once we were homeless and ended up in the basement of a salvation army church the rest of the kids were going to camp there and had to sneak out each morning and pretend i had just arrived
2694943 when i got to high school i said mom i dont want to move any more and we finally stayed put but even then i stayed with four different families
2694944 i just wanted to get out of poverty and i knew college was the answer
2694945 when i crossed that line i got a flashback to when i didnt make the team
2694946 suddenly i wasnt just the fastest in the u s i was the fastest in the world
2694947 it feels a bit odd when i look back to times when i went 12 races in a row finishing third thinking will i ever win
2694948 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief
2694949 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through we have been in touch with hugh throughout this tragedy and we are extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying
2694950 they know we are here for them in every way possible we are binding together as a team to lift the bachman and mccutcheon families we are a family and we will get through this together as a family
2694951 he told us ive got this happening now but we came here with a goal and we need to complete what we have started
2694952 we went into the game knowing that this tragedy had happened but we also knew that the players had invested four years for some eight 12 16 years of their lives and that we came here with some great results
2694953 we know he has several things to take care of we may see him we may not we know he has priorities and needs to take care of them
2694954 all we were thinking about is what can we offer what can we do to help the best thing we could do was just come out here and try to play volleyball
2694955 would you like to be baptized today in jesus name we have clothes for you to change into in the back room and the waters warm

2694958 im going to play the guy who makes the best decisions with the ball
2694959 weve had to accelerate what weve done with the guys on a daily basis jase was the most experienced guy that we had
2694960 he is a good tackler and a smart kid and he is seeing a lot of opportunities so far
2694961 it wasnt a bad practice it just wasnt as clean and crisp relative to what weve had
2694962 there is always a lot we have to do but we got a lot of work done
2694963 for the whole team it was really nice because we finally got to be real physical and kind of let things go let some hits fly
2694964 when you have the first five practices that are in half pads or no pads it is difficult to get caught up with the run game or to assess that part early so we made a focus on running the ball and stopping the run to see where we are in that part
2694965 we want as broad a range of interest as we can get in cycling and theyre definitely tapping into the young demographics
2694966 if im going to get into a sport im going to do it big
2694967 for some reason at halftime we decided to go to sleep
2694968 hes the guy on that team i think hes a little bit more comfortable when he gets there and is able to do a little bit more
2694969 looks like it was an easy game for russia but it was not that way
2694970 but i dont know if its as bad as it looks
2694971 the 40 i got her the 100 i got her the 200 i dont know the 400 she will kill me

2694975 we had a well pitching game from allen and then travis keating and patrick kantakevich came in during the last inning
2694976 we had some chances early on to score some runs and situational hitting wasnt the best tonight
2694977 but youve got to tip your cap to their pitcher he pitched them out of a few jams and did a really nice job
2694978 when i had men on second and first all i really wanted to do was get a ground ball for a double play because thats an easy way to get two outs with one pitch
2694979 but they let a couple go by them and that ended up being a strikeout
2694980 i still wanted a double play because i wanted to get out of the inning i wasnt thinking strikeout at all i just wanted to keep the ball low in the zone so theyd beat it into the ground but my curve ball was working for me and they werent seeing it very well
2694981 that was one of the key situations of the game right there
2694982 you get two singles and then you get out from that inning that was outstanding cause he kept us in the game right there
2694983 it was a key home run right there that put us 4 1 ahead and that gives it to the pitcher at least a little breather right there
2694984 if we continue to pitch well and everything were going to be in the ball game theyve got a pretty good team we have to play well
2694985 bluefields a good team and well see what happens tomorrow
2694986 we need to honor people like coach ball who have given so much of their lives and their time to others
2694987 its very hard to locate some of these people especially if theyve moved from the area
2694988 im an old coach i thought itd be a fitting thing to do to emphasize his career and his former players have a lot of respect for him and what he taught them in terms of work ethic and desire to be the best
2694989 through his years at princeton senior high school coach ball earned the respect of his players his students his colleagues and the community
2694990 if you were fortunate enough to attend games during the ralph ball era you watched as records were set that still stand today and you saw a coach and a team show tiger pride with 110 percent effort every game
2694991 im sure therell be some interesting stories itll be a great time and were really looking forward to it we want people to come out and honor coach at this event whether they were players for coach or just came out and watched
2694992 im still playing very well but the injury has cost me about 15 20 yards on my drives and im about a club and a half shorter with my irons
2694993 however ive become better at getting around the course and ive worked quite a bit on my chipping and putting i dont have to depend as much on hitting it well to score well
2694994 however in february i suffered a separated l5 which if you think of the spine as a stack of bricks is sort of like having one of the bricks slide away from the column
2694995 some days it hurts a lot and other days not so badly ive gained accuracy by sacrificing a little distance though
2694996 im playing every week in the next couple of years i want to turn pro and im going to need to play regularly
2694997 i wont have the luxury of taking time off if i want to make a living so ive decided to continue playing for now i will probably take some time off this winter
2694998 i played pretty well overall but i believe my game plan is what made the difference
2694999 i was patient letting the birdies come and i didnt force anything i put the ball in play and kept it in a position where i took bogey or double bogey out of play
2695000 the fincastle course more than any other course in the region is a true think tank ive been coming here for the past five years in that time i have seen golfers hit great shots and still make bogey because they werent able to put the ball in the right spot
2695001 i have a sweet tooth for this course and the people here he stated
2695002 its a great tournament very well run i love the course and the people
2695003 ive been sitting out for two years all i can say is im ready to get out there
2695004 i had defensive tackle brandon bullock i call him bull i had defensive lineman vinny curry i call him god and i had defensive lineman delvin johnson i call him d j
2695005 they made sure i went to class every day and made sure my work was straight they helped me with everything
2695006 i prayed to god to get me through it and he did
2695007 it was kind of hard because i had people doubting me thinking i wasnt going to make it
2695008 but i had to prove people wrong and let them know i was still hungry and ready
2695009 but im looking forward to it and im going to make the best out of it
2695010 its good to tell people that im with the thundering herd
2695011 we liked being here the most because we have been treated by the other guys and the coaches too like we grew up in tazewell that sure has made it nicer and we appreciate how things are going
2695012 john corner the pauleys eugene hilton theyve stayed with me the past couple of weekends and some nights
2695013 i want to get them in here let the guys know they are part of us now and welcome them to tazewell they are going to make our team better and we are happy they are here
2695014 dad was a pretty good player but he has a soft side for young kids and tazewell football
2695015 we had some good experience coming into the year and this will help when we get t j rasnick back that should really give us some options
2695016 they are dedicated and excited to play here they are looking forward to some better competition here in the southwest district most of the upperclassmen played both ways last year they dont mind to work hard
2695017 the returning players from tazewell have been very nice and made the kids feel welcome because of that they are very glad to be here
2695018 we enjoy it being at tazewell of course we didnt want to lose pocahontas but tazewell is a great place i just want to get out there at middle linebacker and start going to the ball
2695019 were here not only to play baseball and to make ourselves better and these players better with the orioles but to improve the quality of play in this area
2695020 i feel like i have a responsibility year round to promote the game of baseball to young kids anywhere from five years old to high school age weve always tried to do our best job at getting more people involved
2695021 i enjoy working with kids you know through the years when i come to the states even in the major league level some places we give clinics in the mornings and everything
2695022 that brings me back to when i was a kid too we dont have this opportunity that theyre having now we have to learn the game by ourselves but its fun you learn with kids too you watch them doing stuff and you learn
2695023 its nice to teach the kids knowledge and let them know and teaching the right way and everything
2695024 with kids like this especially you cannot talk too much to eventually youre just playing and try to show them how to do things because they learn it quicker
2695025 first you have to teach the kids the balance point how to get into a correct way fielding hitting catching pitching
2695026 you always start from the bottom its almost like when youre building a house or something like that you start with the foundation and thats what the kids are going to have to start with the foundation too so they can learn
2695027 i know when i was a little kid i used to come over here to clinics and i looked forward to it all year long
2695028 youre getting out here on the stadium field here at bowen field taking my shot at the big guys
2695029 the thing about baseball is that you have to learn how to respect yourself not only in baseball but probably in life but in baseball you have to deal with other stuff too and when you learn to respect yourself you learn to respect the game and all the people and everything its a wonderful game
2695030 we try in any way we can to give back to the community
2695031 but this is a good way for us during the season when our players are here to donate our time and give back
2695032 weve lost the whole season they came into the games and enjoyed the games and they deserve it i think this is a beautiful thing im glad that were doing it and the kids are enjoying it
2695033 were going to pick up where we left off last fall and just keep going and keep getting better
2695034 as a group i really like our football team im eager to see how quickly we could be a good football team
2695035 were not a good football team right now were too inexperienced at positions but i think we are working very hard
2695036 we are working very smart were working together great on offense and defense so im really eager to see the way this football team goes
2695037 its still early were young but were a pretty good team
2695038 i feel confident in the team were young but the coaches do a great job of coaching so i feel like if we do what were coached to do we shouldnt have no problem
2695039 these three weeks were going to need this time but at the same time were confident
2695040 weve got a lot of work to do but by the same token the cupboard isnt bare
2695041 weve got four returning guys that are quality football players and i think the guys stepping into some positions that we are replacing are quality football players
2695042 i think our first defense i have been impressed most of the spring we played defense like we play it around here run to the football and get there in an angry mood
2695043 what we need to develop is a second group weve got it at some positions but we dont have it all positions so we need to develop that depth
2695044 weve got a nucleus returning but the problem is building around that nucleus
2695045 with that there is a little youth and inexperience but that is one of the challenges that are presented to us
2695046 we understand that and theyre doing a great job that is the key for us to get better every single day we step on the field and thats our mindset right now
2695047 im in a good situation right now i honestly have six very good tailbacks right now
2695048 i honestly could not tell you who will be our starting tailback as i told them im not the one that is going to make the decision
2695049 theyre the ones that are going to make the decision on who comes out on top weve got great competition right now and i am really excited about the group that we have
2695050 each day we come out and get a little better and get a little more comfortable and the quarterbacks get a little more comfortable with us were starting to mesh a little bit
2695051 i think all of us would like to resolve it its just easier when youve got your starter and youve got your backup
2695052 life is easier but i think were dealing with a complicated situation
2695053 the best thing that i like is it is two really good quarterbacks that are two really good people and good kids and smart were going to get it worked out
2695054 i believe we will have to make a decision both young men will compete very hard and i dont think one will get it over the other and i think it will be hard for one to take it from the other
2695055 its going to be a decision we have to make as a staff but also it is a great situation to be in
2695056 id rather be in this situation than trying to find a quarterback
2695057 im not trying to get too much into that but if we go from here and take care of business and play ball and be aggressive and be dedicated to what we have to do i dont see no reason why we shouldnt

2695060 logramos solo un quiebre que fue suficiente aunque tuvimos opciones para ganarlo m s abultado luego en el segundo se nos complic comenzaron a tirar globos muy altos y as emparejaron el partido jugamos un game desastroso cuando ten amos para cerrar con 5 4 y luego con algo de fortuna quebramos y cerramos 7 5

2695086 umumnya dan terutama dalam ilmu ilmu eksakta dianggap bahwa ilmu pengetahuan disusun dan diatur sekitar hukum hukum umum yang telah dibuktikan kebenarannya secara empiris berdasarkan pengalaman menemukan hukum hukum ilmiah inilah yang merupakan tujuan dari penelitian ilmiah kalau definisi yang tersebut di atas dipakai sebagai patokan maka ilmu politik serta ilmu ilmu sosial lainnya tidak atau belum memenuhi syarat oleh karena sampai sekarang belum menemukan hukum hukum ilmiah itu
2695087 diskusi secara tertulis dalam bidang manajemen baru dimulai tahun 1900 sebelumnya hampir dapat dikatakan belum ada kupasan kupasan secara tertulis dibidang manajemen oleh karena itu dapat dikatakan bahwa manajemen sebagai bidang ilmu pengetahuan merupakan suatu ilmu pengetahuan yang masih muda keadaan demikian ini menyebabkan masih ada orang yang segan mengakuinya sebagai ilmu pengetahuan
2695088 ilmu pengetahuan memiliki beberapa tahap perkembangannya yaitu tahap klasifikasi lalu tahap komparasi dan kemudian tahap kuantifikasi tahap kuantifikasi yaitu tahap di mana ilmu pengetahuan tersebut dalam tahap memperhitungkan kematangannya dalam tahap ini sudah dapat diukur keberadaannya baik secara kuantitas maupun secara kualitas hanya saja ilmu ilmu sosial umumnya terbelakang relatif dan sulit diukur dibanding dengan ilmu ilmu eksakta karena sampai saat ini baru sosiologi yang mengukuhkan keberadaannya ada tahap ini

2695124 i am not quite sure what all the stephen ireland rumour is about there was a bit of confusion about stephen before the game against milan but i had a word with him before the game and explained my interpretation of it it has been sorted out and i explained my understanding of it
2695125 at this time of the year a lot of agents are flying around and at times some are of a view that they can start to exercise some interest in their clients anything we have said in regards of stephen has been misinterpreted and people have run away with it

2695132 we had seen some strange lights while we were leaving indiana beach on lake shaffer it was on wednesday july 23 2008 at about 10 15 i taped some of the objects but the only things you can see is when they would flare up and get really bright when we first seen them their was 3 of them and they were arranged in a triangle shape later 2 others joined them and they lined up in a straight line unfortunately i never got video of them grouped together or of them darting around and zooming from the east to the west of us in a about 2 seconds i did get some video of one of the objects directly above us and one to the east of us as they flared up
2695133 none of these objects made any sounds the only sound we heard was when a military jet flew over us and headed towards the objects the objects disappeared and never returned after a short chase by the military jet as we were driving home my sons mom called him to see if we had seen the strange lights in the sky she lives in rochester indiana which is about 40 miles from where we were at she said she was on the lake on her boat and noticed the lights darting around and flaring up
2695134 it happened thursday july 24th 2008 i live in peru indiana my wife and a few people were sitting outside last night around 10 30 pm my wife came in saying they saw a ufo they said it looked like a ball of fire shortly after i would say 10 or 15 minutes later about 10 jets started flying around where it was seen the jets started dropping flares but the people that saw the ball of fire said it didnt look the same as what they saw about 10 minutes earlier the witnesses were all females and kids and they were clearly shaken by what they saw the jets continued to fly around the area for hours afterwards
2695135 i heard a lot of noise that sounded like jet engines they were really low i stopped at a gas station to take a look and seen jets everywhere it was between nine and ten at night and they were chasing this big bright light that glowed red and yellow i guess all this was happening miles away from me in the sky but it looked closer i was at a gas station and everyone was looking at all this when i went inside the cashier said that he thought it was a ufo and everyone in there said the same thing i stopped somewhere between brookston and monticello
2695136 i heard you on coast to coast and wanted to report a bright light i seen near main street and 31 on the 24th 7 24 08 in rochester the light looked like a spotlight they use for store openings and i saw jets around it at 11pm my kid was with me and he got scared i called my wife and asked if she seen it we live near fulton avenue across town and she said the light was high in the sky above our house she didnt see the jets but heard them
2695137 for we all must appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad
2695138 for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation

2695152 i tend to not really get nervous when im out on a tennis court but today was a little different
2695153 it was something that was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him and that im now in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country
2695154 upon receiving the recommendations of the iocs disciplinary commission the executive board has declared miss thanou ineligible to participate in the 2008 beijing olympic games
2695155 to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration that this case has brought the olympic movement very much into disrepute
2695156 this is an ioc ruling based on its olympic charter
2695157 my blood pressure isnt low its a little high here today but usually after about 30 minutes it will come back down thats usually what will happen
2695158 if we can capture that group not taking care of themselves and entice them into screenings and seeing what their ratings are
2695159 after katrina morehouse has been involved in several different areas im aware of
2695160 i knew that my play on the field made a statement and hopefully i would get rewarded for that
2695161 i knew the organization was a good organization an organization that rewards players for the things that they do on the field
2695162 i think of him as a hall of fame caliber player
2695163 and i feel like im standing up here again right before the first preseason game and were talking about a hall of fame caliber player this is a premier guy leader player
2695164 theres a game plan when he gets here in terms of whats going to happen purely from a medical perspective
2695165 more economic growth more junk producing retail capitalism more motorways more landfill sites more social and spiritual alienation from urban poverty and meaningless work and more personal depression
2695166 a new society with new values based on caring and sharing not exploitation and greed
2695167 at the moment he is with us and we have no formal offer from anybody
2695168 there is interest here and there but nothing concrete i may let one or two go on loan because they need to play it is part of education
2695169 it is not especially to get premiership experience but to play in the first team every week with that pressure
2695170 then when we feel they are ready to integrate in the first team they come back
2695171 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2695172 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2695173 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion
2695174 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
2695175 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2695176 i do not rule anybody completely out at the moment so everything is possible
2695177 i am confident and have belief the team will be focused and treat twente with respect
2695178 we have learned through our experience and i am confident we can qualify
2695179 you always expect good opposition in holland but i believe we are good enough to get through
2695180 today we were very young but i in the end we learned what it is like to defend what we are not used to and in the end it was a good lesson for us
2695181 overall i am pleased because we lacked a bit of experience but we got a positive result with 1 1 even if overall sevilla had many more chances
2695182 he is an exciting player and feel he is still not there physically
2695183 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
2695184 ive beaten the world bronze medallist by 10 points so im feeling great
2695185 ive overcome this big step of getting into the ring for the first time and hopefully ill continue to improve im in a tough draw but ive got to stick to it and hopefully get through
2695186 it was a mature performance from the youngest member of the team against the world bronze medallist
2695187 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens

2695190 what about the centuries of atrocities against the serbian people

2695260 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through we have been in touch with hugh throughout this tragedy and we are extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying
2695261 they know we are here for them in every way possible we are binding together as a team to lift the bachman and mccutcheon families we are a family and we will get through this together as a family
2695262 he told us ive got this happening now but we came here with a goal and we need to complete what we have started
2695263 we went into the game knowing that this tragedy had happened but we also knew that the players had invested four years for some eight 12 16 years of their lives and that we came here with some great results
2695264 we know he has several things to take care of we may see him we may not we know he has priorities and needs to take care of them
2695265 all we were thinking about is what can we offer what can we do to help the best thing we could do was just come out here and try to play volleyball
2695266 we dont have much olympic experience but we gradually adapted to their style and played well in the second half
2695267 i think were a good team well find out just how good on wednesday when we play spain
2695268 its good to score but we have to worry about our defense
2695269 this is a much stronger german team than the one we met in japan during the last world championships
2695270 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2695271 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2695272 i tend to not really get nervous when im out on a tennis court but today was a little different
2695273 its about as humid as ive ever played in and i live in
2695274 its pretty sticky youve got to keep your wristbands on and youve got to keep going to the towel
2695275 when i was changing sides there was plenty of sweat droplets on the court from chris as well
2695276 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger they need to succeed
2695277 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
2695278 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2695279 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the
2695280 this will be nothing like that game things are different now and we have the chance to win
2695281 weve had good preparation for the pre season and now we really want to win this first match at
2695282 of course we will approach this game very differently to nigeria we have to be a lot more committed we have to play and work hard and make sure we do our best
2695283 they are a very good side but i believed we would win the fa cup if i didnt believe i would not play football you cannot just give up
2695284 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2695285 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2695286 you dont have access to write to the installation directory
2695287 you feel like it is time to move on expand your horizons etc

2695290 ich habe mir die vergangenheit der beiden erfolgreichen unternehmen sinn und leffers angeschaut und dann gesehen wie sie im karstadtquelle konzern immer mehr von ihrer eigenst ndigkeit und ihren qualit ten eingeb t hatten

2695292 exporters incurred losses last fiscal due to the rupee appreciation this time around they are cautious in adding new clients since high raw material prices has impacted production cost
2695293 our firm is not exploring new clients and we would limit exports to our existing customers only
2695294 the respondent had fixed the retail sale price as rs 9 whereas it had altered the price and declared it at rs 10 therefore altered mrp would have to be the mrp for assessment purposes
2695295 the central board of direct taxes cbdt has decided to fine tune and upgrade the cass by including over 100 parameters to ensure that the returns of all companies which could pose risk to revenue are covered in the scrutiny
2695296 identity blind cass software khan said there is a provision of adopting multiple criteria to select cases for scrutiny by changing parameters so that risk to revenue is minimised although he added the department would continue to select certain cases manually for scrutiny

2695332 theyre sweating like hell in this 90 degree heat and 90 percent humidity which they have to deal with at the moment
2695333 but to tell you the truth we really dont ride at all in beijing in the summer its like committing suicide seriously the pollution is so bad
2695334 theres no need for them to be wearing those masks its no use
2695335 i believe anywhere within 150 to 200 kilometers of beijing generally isnt suitable for sports
2695336 the training sessions were much worse here in the hills it is much better than in the city
2695337 it was like a burning impression in the lungs and the eyes
2695338 do you think 240 kilometers is good for your health
2695339 i guess its better than i expected because i didnt really feel anything
2695340 it was a lot cooler up in the hills too
2695341 i mean its humid but i didnt die or anything
2695342 i didnt have any problems with my lungs or anything
2695343 i heard from the beginning that many riders were complaining that their eyes hurt and that their lungs hurt but not for me
2695344 i think you definitely felt it in the lungs it must be a negative effect
2695345 obviously coming from a capetown in winter is a bit of a disadvantage

2695365 it sounds to me like a guy who either wanted to do a torch job or commit suicide
2695366 it appears that there has been a very hot and intense fire in an enclosed area within the washroom
2695367 until we determine precisely what happened in that cubicle and what caused those flames that took that mans life i really cant speculate
2695368 there was an explosion in the mens washroom then there was a stampede and everybody ran out
2695369 there was a call by the people that worked at tim hortons doughnuts that a package had been left by a customer and they just were concerned about it given what had transpired
2695370 we werent witness to an explosion and there was a very small amount of smoke upon our arrival
2695371 it doesnt appear that we could see much of a fire
2695372 police dealt with it by exploding the package on the street
2695373 there was nothing in the package of a suspicious or problematic nature
2695374 there was more in the tank and they never released it
2695375 training had gone well but out there i thought they produced maybe 10 less than what they had trained if we make that eighth position and go into the final hopefully theyll release what they can achieve and then well see they are inexperienced and i think it was nerves that got to them
2695376 i would be gutted for beth if she didnt make the final shes given four years for this moment but she was off centre right from the first skill and then the timing was wrong on the downswing and she clipped her heel she did well to make it from there now shes got six hours of just hanging waiting if when maybe i wouldnt like to be in her shoes of course she deserves to be there but in this game deserving isnt enough

2695409 building a deep understanding of vitas goals and objectives was a critical first step in winning this contract and our business development team played an invaluable role in defining key themes and identifying target audiences marketing and business development were joined at the hip on this positioning and branding initiative for three years we worked together to figure out how to reach the right people with the right messages at the right times and places it was a very collaborative effort and we couldnt have implemented the campaign without them

2695411 we knew that it wasnt that our channel partners didnt want to sell our services
2695412 they knew that they were leaving money on the table just as clearly as we did but many of our partners believed that cisco services competed directly with other partner offerings and because of this a number of them chose not to position services training partners and their sales staff to understand why cisco services are different and how to sell them is the ultimate goal of the arm service incentive program
2695413 by targeting both owners managers and individual sales reps were providing two very strong reasons to participate to benefit the business by increasing the sale of highly profitable services and to benefit the individuals who sell those services by giving them a chance to win cool prizes
2695414 the best markers are experimenting more with newer marketing techniques such as blogging podcasting and social networking
2695415 on top of that id like to point out that although web 2
2695416 building online communities for our customers made sense to us for two main reasons first theyd enable us to get continuous customer feedback rather than semiannual or ad hoc feedback second theyd allow us to really drill down on a particular topic and get insight we could act on when we act on the feedback we receive from our customers it shows them that were listening to them that we really care the communities enable us to do that
2695417 everyone wants to use the communities our biggest issue now is how to stagger all the activities everyone wants to do

2695448 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2695451 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2695452 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2695453 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2695454 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2695455 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats

2695463 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2695464 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2695465 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2695466 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2695467 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2695468 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2695469 restate a pechino vincete il maggior numero di medaglie e lottate sul campo sportivo per lonore del paese
2695470 since you are under the same sentence 41 we are punished justly for we are getting what our deeds deserve but this man has done nothing wrong
2695471 i tell you the truth today you will be with me in paradise
2695472 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2695473 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2695474 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2695475 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2695476 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2695477 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2695478 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2695479 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2695480 de heerser over de russische aarde is steeds de rus dit was zo en zal steeds zo zijn
2695481 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2695482 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2695483 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2695484 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2695485 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2695486 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2695487 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2695488 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2695489 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2695490 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2695491 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2695492 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2695493 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2695494 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2695495 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2695496 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2695497 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2695498 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2695499 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2695500 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2695501 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2695502 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2695503 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2695504 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2695505 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2695506 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2695507 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2695508 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2695509 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2695510 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2695511 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2695512 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2695513 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2695514 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2695515 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2695516 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2695517 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2695518 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2695519 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2695520 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2695521 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2695522 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2695523 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2695524 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2695525 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2695526 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2695527 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2695528 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2695529 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2695530 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2695531 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2695532 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2695533 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2695534 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2695535 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2695536 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2695537 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2695538 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2695539 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2695540 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2695541 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2695542 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2695543 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2695544 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2695545 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2695546 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2695547 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2695548 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2695549 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2695550 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2695551 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2695552 saturdays attack was an isolated criminal act unrelated to the games
2695553 the ioc believes this is the right decision most of all for the athletes who have trained so hard for this event
2695554 serious and life threatening injuries from multiple lacerations stab wounds and was in critical but stable condition after an eight hour surgery the u s olympic committee said in a statement sunday
2695555 because he is dead there is no way to find out his motive
2695556 i would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to you and the family f the victims over this unfortunate incident
2695557 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2695558 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2695559 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2695560 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2695561 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2695562 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2695563 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2695564 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2695565 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2695566 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2695567 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2695568 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2695569 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2695570 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2695571 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2695572 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2695573 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2695574 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2695575 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2695576 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2695577 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2695578 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2695579 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2695580 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2695581 tbr s mission is to drive the adoption of free textbooks by teachers and professors we want to get these books into classrooms our approach is to bring all of the free textbooks we can find together in one place review them and let the best rise to the top and find their way into the hands of students in classrooms around the world

2695585 britain needs a bill of rights to protect the liberty of the individual
2695586 we recommend for inclusion amongst others the right to trial by jury the right to administrative justice and international human rights as yet not incorporated into uk law
2695587 we believe that there is a strong case for detailed rights for children and we recommend that the public should be consulted about including specific rights for other vulnerable groups
2695588 rights such as the right to adequate healthcare to education and to protection against the worst extremes of poverty touch the substance of peoples everyday lives
2695589 and it would help to correct the popular misconception that human rights are a charter for criminals and terrorists
2695590 we want to see a bill of rights that would set the bar for the universal standards to which everyone is entitled and fills the gaps in the protection of more vulnerable people such as the elderly children or people with learning disabilities
2695591 i learned that we have one dog in our house and they have four also we have a fountain in our garden but they have a stream that has no end and we have imported lamps in our garden where they have the stars and our garden goes to the edge of our property but they have the entire horizon as their back yard

2695597 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2695598 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2695599 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2695600 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2695601 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2695602 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2695603 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2695604 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2695605 ive spent the last few weeks hoping that i wasnt going to get fired but now wished i would of

2695608 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2695609 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2695610 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2695611 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2695612 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2695613 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2695614 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2695615 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2695616 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2695617 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2695618 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2695619 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2695620 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2695621 the omagh community spirit i read so much about in newspaper articles never existed for me
2695622 the victims are running our own service which we did do the last five years
2695623 im not attending the other service weve held our service this last five years on the sunday closest to the date and thats the way weve been doing it everybodys welcome to come along and we want to progress that way
2695624 what ill be doing on the sunday is commemorating those murdered on the street
2695625 whats happening on friday to me is just a big facade about the great job they the council think theyve done
2695626 as a council we have tried to do our best to mark the anniversary
2695627 i realise its a sensitive time and different people will react differently
2695628 but i cant legislate for how some families are going to react thats their prerogative
2695629 the wording issue as far as we are concerned is resolved
2695630 i know the support group wanted certain wording at the garden and that has been included
2695631 this was a sensitive issue and we appointed an independent facilitation team to work on it
2695632 they came up with some very sensitive wording and included the support groups chosen words
2695633 some people had an idea that the council had already decided what they were going to do with the memorial
2695634 but that was never the case we waited for the independent teams report and accepted that

2695650 like most debating stances it obscures as much as it reveals but its assumptions are more enlightening than its conclusions mass market fiction the historical novel the thriller the crime novel and other incarnations of genre based storytelling have not been judged worthy of critical notice no matter their level of engagement with the now deceased celtic tiger where is our bret easton ellis our bonfire of the vanities

2695690 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2695691 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2695692 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2695693 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2695694 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2695695 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2695696 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2695697 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2695698 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2695699 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2695700 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2695701 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2695702 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2695703 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2695704 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2695705 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2695706 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2695707 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2695708 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

2695717 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions
2695718 the wind at the time was a south westerly force 5 7 with a moderate to rough sea state generating a heavy surf
2695719 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions
2695720 in the meantime you must try and put up with me
2695721 you will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul and your nerves will be worse than ever from moping i shall just give you letters of introduction to all the people i know there some of them as far as i can remember were quite nice
2695722 my sister was staying here at the rectory you know some four years ago and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here
2695723 you may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an october afternoon
2695724 it is quite warm for the time of the year
2695725 but has that window got anything to do with the tragedy
2695726 my husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting and they always come in this way theyve been out for snipe in the marshes today so theyll make a fine mess over my poor carpets so like you menfolk isnt it
2695727 the doctors agree in ordering me complete rest an absence of mental excitement and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical exercise
2695728 on the matter of diet they are not so much in agreement
2695729 just in time for tea and dont they look as if they were muddy up to the eyes
2695730 fairly muddy but most of its dry who was that who bolted out as we came up
2695731 could only talk about his illnesses and dashed off without a word of goodby or apology when you arrived one would think he had seen a ghost
2695732 he told me he had a horror of dogs he was once hunted into a cemetery somewhere on the banks of the ganges by a pack of pariah dogs and had to spend the night in a newly dug grave with the creatures snarling and grinning and foaming just above him enough to make anyone lose their nerve
2695733 we get in early at the first domestic and give the guy a card
2695734 it tells them there is help available its not about being punitive but telling them its ok to ask for help
2695735 no one is out to get anyone we just want them to make a change
2695736 the feedback from frontline officers is the guys are saying good something for me which is good
2695737 at the moment he is with us and we have no formal offer from anybody
2695738 there is interest here and there but nothing concrete i may let one or two go on loan because they need to play it is part of education
2695739 it is not especially to get premiership experience but to play in the first team every week with that pressure
2695740 then when we feel they are ready to integrate in the first team they come back
2695741 we havent had any recent contact with real madrid has there been any attempt to heal the rift yeah that will be right
2695742 they put a bid in i dont know if it was fax or letter or whatever just one it was sometime in the summer
2695743 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days
2695744 it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance
2695745 i think we will just let the thing settle down now it will take its course
2695746 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
2695747 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2695748 i do not rule anybody completely out at the moment so everything is possible
2695749 i am confident and have belief the team will be focused and treat twente with respect
2695750 we have learned through our experience and i am confident we can qualify
2695751 you always expect good opposition in holland but i believe we are good enough to get through
2695752 today we were very young but i in the end we learned what it is like to defend what we are not used to and in the end it was a good lesson for us
2695753 overall i am pleased because we lacked a bit of experience but we got a positive result with 1 1 even if overall sevilla had many more chances
2695754 he is an exciting player and feel he is still not there physically

2695814 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2695815 our unomig military observers report ongoing military preparation by the abkhaz de facto authorities for a military operation in the upper kodori valley probably tomorrow morning
2695816 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2695817 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2695818 the georgians have made an offer of a ceasefire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2695819 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2695820 there is great dispute and controversy about the origins of this including prior mobilisation of russian troops on the other side of the georgian border
2695821 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2695822 we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2695823 we ask that his family amp squo s privacy continues to be respected
2695824 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2695825 we were never informed or advised that an indictment was imminent of him
2695826 it had never been made clear to him nor to us that he was the suspect
2695827 theyve maintained that they are confident they have the correct person neither we nor the public have been presented with any hard direct evidence of the doctors involvement in these killings
2695828 its very difficult when you have no direct evidence that this man was involved in it to say that he was the only one that had access to this material
2695829 in that affidavit there are at least eight other people who the government had the same suspicions on or enough suspicions anyway to get either search warrants for either their laboratories or their homes or their vehicles and how those people were eliminated we just have no information about how they were eliminated
2695830 i think you have to look at the source of that information
2695831 the therapist trainee who relayed that information relayed it in court with an fbi agent at her side there are all kinds of issues about what someone says in the course of treatment whether that what that is we have no context for that information
2695832 were not saying that he wasnt depressed he was suffering from depression he was drinking excessively much later on in the investigation but to say that information is valid i would really i would highly challenge the credibility of the source of that information
2695833 there is absolutely no evidence to support anything like that i mean absolutely categorically no evidence to support that
2695834 obviously our concern is that the government has taken a couple of threads about a persons life and is trying to build a case around that without looking at the entirety of the evidence and without looking at the entire person
2695835 all you have are government leaks and the selective information they choose to release at this point as that information becomes available we will comment on it as appropriate

2695883 he is a good tackler and a smart kid and he is seeing a lot of opportunities so far
2695884 it wasnt a bad practice it just wasnt as clean and crisp relative to what weve had
2695885 there is always a lot we have to do but we got a lot of work done
2695886 we want as broad a range of interest as we can get in cycling and theyre definitely tapping into the young demographics
2695887 if im going to get into a sport im going to do it big
2695888 im going to play the guy who makes the best decisions with the ball
2695889 weve had to accelerate what weve done with the guys on a daily basis jase was the most experienced guy that we had
2695890 for the whole team it was really nice because we finally got to be real physical and kind of let things go let some hits fly
2695891 when you have the first five practices that are in half pads or no pads it is difficult to get caught up with the run game or to assess that part early so we made a focus on running the ball and stopping the run to see where we are in that part
2695892 this is joe and hes the account planner and sarah is the copywriter
2695893 were here today because youve had a large impact to a very unique set of customers in what youve done for the last nine years

2695895 dragonflies have got some jaws on em ive seen one take down a fucking wasp
2695896 well a wasp is a lot smaller than a praying mantis isnt it but then again
2695897 if the dragonfly gets to swoop down on the praying mantis then its no contest dragonfly hands down but if you put them on the ground facing each other and give em a three count to begin with i still say the mantis wins
2695898 because praying mantes have longer arms he could hold the dragonfly out like this
2695899 and the dragonfly would just be punching at the air

2695903 hes the guy on that team i think hes a little bit more comfortable when he gets there and is able to do a little bit more
2695904 looks like it was an easy game for russia but it was not that way
2695905 weve been resilient at times these are the dog days of august youve got to push yourself and rise to the occasion
2695906 i can still represent my country in the womens team finals wednesday
2695907 i fell it was a mistake im disappointed it happened but im happy it happened today instead of wednesday i know i can hit that bar routine it was a fluke

2695909 in this environment the only programs that i see as safe are football and mens and womens basketball
2695910 wed all be naive if we didnt feel better every time we got a scholarship endowed
2695911 were in a little bit of survival mode right now
2695912 people are starting to realize if you endow a program it means it wont disappear
2695913 the realization that we all have to invest in the future of things that are special to us is hitting home
2695914 rather than having the little ones we have wed like to combine them and have them grow faster
2695915 hopefully if you are proactive youll never get to that point
2695916 there is a constant pull for dollars and what you can spend today versus the dollars you can invest for the future paying for today wins out in a lot of cases and it can be hard when you have this big endowment fund but you cant touch it but that is the attraction that it is going to be there forever and ever
2695917 united behind a commitment that every american man woman and child be guaranteed to have affordable comprehensive health care
2695918 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2695919 i understand that this is a difficult and painful time to them and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2695920 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2695921 i think theres an unusual split in the group we havent seen in the past
2695922 exactly because funding va programs commands bipartisan support some in the congress like to attach unrelated pork barrel appropriations and earmarks to va bills
2695923 the result is to mix vital national priorities with wasteful and often worthless political pork
2695924 let me make very clear this card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans healthcare as some have wrongly charged
2695925 out into the local economy in hope that someone can take care of their combat wounds its essentially privatization something i cannot support
2695926 well have a simple principle for veterans sleeping on our streets zero tolerance
2695927 could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
2695928 would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory

2695932 fabrizio corona poliziotto al cinema no non sha da fare
2695933 that first inning could have exploded into a disaster but i got out of that with just one run
2695934 i thought if we hung on and hung on wed get some whacks at this guy moehler
2695935 he doesnt have overpowering stuff but he was cutting it in there with a little bit of sink and kept us off balance
2695936 thats the second time he has thrown better than me
2695937 because like i say i dont know what to say we have two choices we can give up or keep fighting were still fighting im running out of things to come up with to say
2695938 bronson got out of that first inning against some tough hitters and when he did that i thought we had action on winning the ball game
2695939 but against moehler we took good pitches and it seemed when we swung it wasnt a very good pitch to hit we made him look like cy young
2695940 one run isnt going to get it done unless you shut em out and i havent seen one of those in a long time
2695941 it didnt look good he carried us the last month and a half its a big hole to fill but were capable of filling it im just now starting to suck it up
2695942 thats how i play how i was taught how i learned the only way i know how
2695943 its all about playing the game the right way no matter how bad it is and how bad it looks or how much you struggle as a team
2695944 not only me and joey votto but the whole team is going to be fun to watch for a long time and in the near future
2695945 i know fans are tired of hearing it but just be patient a little while longer
2695946 we have all the pieces and we just have to put it together i understand the fans thats fans for you but we as a team cant worry about that because we have to take care of our business this is a baseball town that has been spoiled in the past were not going to be the big red machine or anything but this team is going to be fun to watch for a very long time
2695947 thats the most fun i ever had in baseball last year when i did color commentary for espn on the little league world series those kids can play too they show exuberance and are fundamentally sound my wife watches and when those little boys cry she cries
2695948 i was breathless when i hit it and i was thinking i will remember this for the rest of my life
2695949 i thought it was just a pop fly and i was thinking this is not going to be good
2695950 i took another look when i rounded first and it went over the fence i was ecstatic
2695951 i was really nervous coming in after all its the finals of the cana dian championships
2695952 it wasnt the greatest today it was off and on
2695953 for the most part it was there when i needed it
2695954 you cant count your eggs too early though but as we went along these guys held it togeth er and stayed solid the whole way through
2695955 you watch it on television and you read about it and now we are go ing it is amazing
2695956 white rock went last year and even though it was a completely different team they came back and told us about it so we cant wait to have that experience
2695957 he was so dominant in the 90s i feel like i still have a good 10 years left in me and i can extend that run
2695958 if you look at the guys that finished up front we pitted in a different se quence than everybody else and it finally paid off
2695959 for making all the changes that we did thats an unbeliebable race a great race
2695960 we tried to save our tires and that probably gave me enough edge to get by mike

2695962 from the seasons perspective we all know how the premiership table is tightening up so it was a pretty critical game for both clubs
2695963 its good for us because a win makes it a bit better for andrew great for him
2695964 we kicked over 100 points in those conditions and for our forward line to have 12 goal scorers weve just got to keep finding ways of making sure we can kick a score
2695965 in the first half i thought our kicking in particular was very good and we got some really powerful running which you could argue weve lacked a bit
2695966 were bitterly disappointed with our performance season on the line stuff and to come over and not play our game style was disappointing
2695967 it started virtually from the first kick of the game

2696010 i have advised the president to choose a dignified exit and resign to save the country from further polarisation
2696011 if he did not quit than its obvious i will vote in favour of his impeachment
2696012 i think there would be a settlement no impeachment in view of resignation
2696013 i think he would resign because its a stigma to be the first president who is impeached

2696017 at the moment i as a cricketer feel left out with the whole worlds focus is on the beijing olympics
2696018 inclusion of cricket in the olympics would give cricket a whole new identity as the games is massive i guess the all icc full members can get direct entry to the main event and the other teams can come in through qualifiers
2696019 also the best cricketers in the world should be eligible to play and there should not be any age limit
2696020 it will be a decision welcomed by professional cricketers if it happens
2696021 besides who doesnt want to be part of an event so huge the twenty20 version is ideally suited to the olympics as it has mass pulling power and entertainment value
2696022 it doesnt take a lot of time and will be easier for the world audience to understand i am not in favour of allowing every country to participate the full members and three or four qualifiers would ensure quality
2696023 so didnt expect maybe so many at the lower end of the spectrum

2696031 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2696090 myths and misconceptions about biofuels are coming in the way of promoting them as an alternative source of energy
2696091 we have to demystify the issues at stake to ensure our energy security in future
2696092 biofuel can make india self sufficient in energy source as the product has been proven to be efficient sustainable cost effective and pollution free
2696093 biofuels are renewable liquid fuels made from plant matter rather than fossil fuels primary biofuels are ethanol and bio diesel they help reduce air toxics emissions greenhouse gas build up and dependence on imported oil
2696094 we never encourage farmers to sow biofuel plants in fertile farmland plants like jatropha hongai and neem that yield biofuel require minimum water and maintenance whats more animals or insects do not feed on them and ethanol is a by product of sugarcane
2696095 as a future source of energy biofuel has the potential to change urban transportation and bring about a revolution in rural india where farmers can use it to run tractors and derive biogas and organic manure as its residue for lighting cooking and soil nutrient instead of using toxic fertilisers
2696096 the message is yet to spread across we have decided to conduct sustained campaign across the country
2696097 the countrys development is correlated to energy use once our energy requirements are met growth can be ensured
2696098 we want ethanol content to be increased by another 10 percent in petrol and diesel the greater the use of ethanol the more fossil fuels will be eco friendly use of bio diesel and bio petrol do not require any change in the vehicle engine

2696164 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2696165 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio

2696173 as a position player it makes you step your game up because you dont want to waste this opportunity when you get a pitcher like that you want to make sure you give him everything you got hes doing his part

2696176 if you have to ask what the price is you cant afford it
2696177 the team is better than we were a few days ago we have committed less mistakes than we have done in previous games
2696178 we now need to continue to prepare for the super cup and the league
2696179 i think that we have had some tough games against sides that were ahead of us in their preparations physically and that made things more difficult
2696180 bae may provide as many as 70 extra combat aircraft tothe saudis although some defence industry executives say thecontract is likely to be for 48

2696182 lenovo has just come to the forefront of the global stage we still have a long way to go to become as strong as thosecompanies that are on the fortune 500 year after year
2696183 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger they need to succeed
2696184 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
2696185 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2696186 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the
2696187 this will be nothing like that game things are different now and we have the chance to win
2696188 weve had good preparation for the pre season and now we really want to win this first match at
2696189 of course we will approach this game very differently to nigeria we have to be a lot more committed we have to play and work hard and make sure we do our best
2696190 they are a very good side but i believed we would win the fa cup if i didnt believe i would not play football you cannot just give up
2696191 the afc challenge cup organising committee inspected the gachibowli stadium today and found the pitch unplayable after incessant rains deteriorated the ground surface afc will conduct an inspection of new delhis ambedkar stadium on sunday both these matches would be played on august 13 if afc finds the ambedkar stadium suitable to host the games
2696192 the ground at gachibowli was also unplayable and with the kind of rain here it will be worse tomorrow the match then will not be decided by football skills it will be a shame if a final match of such an important tournament is decided by factors not connected to football
2696193 lal bahadur stadium was no better than gachibowli it will be an embarassment for the afc and aiff if the final is played at lbs which is a cricket ground
2696194 i dont know which place we would like to play with rain everywhere in the country but dont tell me kolkata
2696195 moreover we do not want to wait that long we have prepared hard for this tournament i cant keep the boys together for that long
2696196 the matches on august 10 have been postponed and the amended schedule will be announced tomorrow
2696197 we have three options now first it may be played tomorrow as scheduled either at the gachibowli stadium or lal bahadur stadium here the second option is to shift the venue to another city and play within a week the last option is to postpone the game for a month or two
2696198 no me voy a meter con este final tan abierto que no es ni final
2696199 its much more difficult for couples to sell homes unless they are selling at a loss
2696200 if a couple had separated two years ago and if they hadnt long bought a home the chances are it would have gone up in value now you might get couples who are trying to sell a home that has dropped in value so they dont really have any equity in it
2696201 couples breaking up or on the more positive side getting together is a significant driver of real estate transactions anecdotally we say that one in five property sales has something to do with a marriage issue
2696202 theyre having to wait longer than they would have if they had separated two years ago to get a price they both think is appropriate in a broken relationship they may not persevere for a higher price for as long because of the emotional stress of being under the same roof
2696203 the other edge of the sword is that with the reduction in the value of the property the amount of equity left in the home becomes much more marginal
2696204 well wanderers are always lonely i dont expect you to find fulfillment that way but some people have to be young and foolish at some point just dont take too long with this fancy if you insist then dont come to me and complain when youre 30 alone childless and barren
2696205 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2696206 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2696207 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2696208 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2696209 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2696210 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2696211 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2696212 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2696221 it rained every day we shot in a raging river and then there was the beginning of the movie with the war action scenes after the copters and bullets im in handcuffs as my character my hands tied behind my back and i have to say cut it was a pretty big day at work
2696222 i dont think any of us were afraid of that idea
2696223 we knew we had to get the tone just perfectly at the end of the day were not putting a guy in blackface were putting a really pretentious actor in blackface were the object of our own ridicule
2696224 it was so long in the gestation process that by the time we were making this movie i was so excited just to be there
2696225 at one point i thought he could play my agent in the film
2696226 tom thought it would be much more interesting for him to be the studio guy
2696227 tom said now i want to dance as this guy we filmed him doing a makeup test and he just got up and danced in perfect time to music that wasnt there i was so into it that we added music later on and put that dance over the end titles
2696228 no heres the great thing about downey he has an incredible sense of humor about himself plus hes in such a good place in his life that he doesnt have any issues with it if youre respectful toward him as a person hes fine with it
2696229 since i was about 10 or 11 i wanted to be a director
2696230 i always thought thats what i would end up doing later on when i wasnt acting anymore because you never know where an acting career will go
2696231 i love acting too but directing is much more fulfilling as a creative process you get to see the whole thing through when youre acting youre putting it out there but you dont have that feeling of completion
2696232 the direction by ben was tremendous he was great because he was one of us he takes it on from an actors perspective he doesnt make you feel like youre just a puppet
2696233 he knows if a director gets up in your face and tells you how to act it takes all the joy out of the experience
2696234 it helps to have some sensitivity to what it feels like to be in front of the camera it allows the other actors to have enough comfort to be there
2696235 i dont know im totally open to whatever makes them happy
2696236 at this point theyre so young im interested in seeing where their instincts take them
2696237 shed rather play with her princess dolls which is very healthy
2696238 my son came to the set of night of the museum and now he gets what daddy does all day with the fake dinosaurs and the fake creatures
2696239 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2696240 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2696241 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2696242 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2696243 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2696244 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2696245 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2696246 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2696247 durch die vielen gelbphasen war es ein sehr schwieriges rennen eine zeit lang sah es so aus als w rde es f r uns sehr schwer sein zu gewinnen wir haben dann aber zum schluss durch eine wirklich gute performance und audi tdi power das ergebnis doch noch sicherstellen k nnen ich freue mich unheimlich f r das team dass wir diesen doppelsieg nach hause gefahren haben und es war auch ein sehr sch ner einstand f r marcel f ssler bei audi
2696248 die strategie die wir uns im vorfeld ausgemalt hatten ging durch die vielen safety car phasen nicht auf trotzdem konnte ich mich ganz gut absetzen unser vorsprung ist durch die gelbphasen leider immer wieder kaputtgegangen gott sei dank hat es am ende trotzdem zum sieg gereicht ich bin supergl cklich auch marcel f ssler muss man loben er ist sein erstes rennen mit dem auto gefahren und hat sich am ende noch die beiden acura honda geschnappt und damit den neuerlichen audi doppelsieg perfekt gemacht das war wieder ein tolles rennwochenende danke an das team audi sport north america an die jungs zuhause und michelin
2696249 ein sch nes jubil um das rennen war nicht einfach gerade nach dem vorletzten restart als die beiden acura honda vor mir waren hinter diesen fahrzeugen verliert man sehr viel abtrieb deshalb war es unheimlich schwer an sie heranzukommen einmal war ich sogar neben der strecke am ende hat es aber gut funktioniert dank audi tdi power haben wir die acura honda auf der geraden gepackt es war ein sch nes rennen ich war lange im auto es hat viel spa gemacht
2696250 das war ein ganz besonderes rennen f r mich der restart am schluss war unglaublich es war ganz sch n eng zwischen brabham und der mauer aber ich sagte mir jetzt oder nie es hat funktioniert ich bin sehr gl cklich den zweiten platz f r das team geholt zu haben es lief von anfang an ganz gut ich bin zufrieden generell ist die atmosph re bei audi und in der american le mans serie perfekt
2696251 ich bin wirklich gl cklich es war ein sehr gutes und interessantes rennen mit vielen gelbphasen einige haben uns geholfen andere nicht ich glaube wir haben gute arbeit geleistet marcel ist sehr gut gefahren und hat sich wirklich gut in das team integriert es gibt keinen grund zur klage und wir k nnen mit strahlenden gesichtern nach hause gehen
2696252 das war ein perfekter tag mit einer perfekten fahrt aller vier piloten das team hat keinen einzigen fehler gemacht die strategie war gut die boxenstopps waren gut und beide fahrer haben am ende des rennens tolle berholman ver gezeigt

2696255 it could mean that no one is using the nt election as a guide it could mean that weve got the odds about right or it could mean that everybody is well and truly in olympic mode
2696256 people will judge harshly a government that calls an early election to avoid public scrutiny
2696257 mr carpenter called an early election to avoid people learning more about the labor government and its shady dealings through the corruption and crime commission
2696258 people dont like being used as pawns in the election process simply because the government wants to avoid scrutiny
2696259 we were effectively looking at a six to eight month election campaign stretched out in front of everybody where everything i was saying and doing and everything the ministers were saying and doing was being discounted as being said because an election was looming
2696260 we needed to get the situation sorted out to give us some certainty some clarity end the cynicism and thats what weve done

2696262 its an opportunity for small business owners to get their local mps on their own turf where they feel comfortable and are able to show what its like to run the business and what pressures they are under
2696263 they get to see how it operates in reality the local businesses have a good time it keeps mps in touch with the coalface
2696264 as long a people are alone theyre not going to be able to figure anything much out if theyre together theyll start having thoughts interchanging them and learning about them

2696354 we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2696355 i will share the road when cyclists start obeying the traffic laws
2696356 i always see bikers disobeying traffic signals they always run red lights going across r street and connecticut ave
2696357 what can we do to get cyclist to obey stop lights
2696358 if bicyclists want to be respected like other vehicles they have to obey the same rules
2696359 well officer i thought it was ok to hit this cyclists because several blocks back i saw another run a red light
2696360 but we all know its safer for cyclists to run lights than cars
2696361 he wasnt riding in the street either but coming from the median
2696362 road area he was biking on also has caused numerous fatalities due to poor construction of the roads and no sidewalks
2696363 when youve trained people to drive according to the signs you need to keep adding more signs to tell them exactly when and in what fashion they need to adjust their behavior otherwise drivers may see no reason why they should slow down on a curve in the rain
2696364 many drivers break the law i would almost be willing to say that every driver breaks the law
2696365 if you obey the law to build good will you pay full price but get only incremental benefit
2696366 yknow that thing you did to get drivers to stop running red lights you just modify it for cyclists
2696367 now hold on the one way streets are for you people another bike and i can see each other coming and pass quite safely when were traveling in opposite directions on the same road this one way scenario wouldnt even be here if it werent for you cars
2696368 everything would be fine if cyclists would stop running red lights
2696369 there is no need to be concerned for cyclists safety until they begin to bike responsibly like drivers do
2696370 di far urlare il pi possibile gli oggetti pi familiari
2696371 holy shit kev is in the olympics you have to watch it
2696372 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
2696373 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
2696374 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
2696375 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
2696376 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
2696377 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
2696378 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
2696379 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
2696380 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
2696381 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
2696382 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
2696383 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
2696384 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
2696385 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
2696386 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
2696387 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
2696388 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
2696389 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
2696390 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
2696391 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
2696392 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
2696393 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
2696394 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad

2696419 in the main part of the house walls were white and somewhat stark we painted every nook and cranny to warm it up bring it up to date
2696420 this bar is not our taste but it really belongs in this room we couldnt bear to change it
2696421 both tim and i come from large families and we often have lots of them visiting at the same time we can sleep everybody in this house

2696423 powering a fancy tv and full on entertainment system with set top boxes game consoles speakers dvds and digital video recorders can add nearly 200 to a familys annual energy bill
2696424 what scares us is that prices for plasma sets are dropping so fast that people are saying why get a 42 inch plasma set when you can get a 60 inch or 64 inch one
2696425 they have no idea how much electricity these things consume
2696426 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2696427 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2696428 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2696429 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2696430 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2696431 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2696432 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2696433 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2696434 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2696435 we tried to look for ideas in every choice that we make in our homes hoping that everyone who goes through it will be inspired to make some change on some level
2696436 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens
2696437 it is happening but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it
2696438 i like not making a negative impact on the earth
2696439 its got so much to be said for it because it uses nature and natural materials
2696440 its open you bring the outside in and you can even bring the inside out its a house built for humans its plausible in real life
2696441 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
2696442 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
2696443 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating
2696444 if youre very clever if youre a do it yourself kind of person you can do one room at a time and achieve your ultimate goal

2696462 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2696463 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2696464 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2696468 it wasnt what he said it was how he said it
2696469 thats the way it should be done all you big headed megalomaniacs
2696470 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2696471 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2696472 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2696473 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2696474 we dont have much olympic experience but we gradually adapted to their style and played well in the second half
2696475 i think were a good team well find out just how good on wednesday when we play spain
2696476 its good to score but we have to worry about our defence
2696477 this is a much stronger german team than the one we met in japan during the last world championships
2696478 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2696479 balance is the key to success in all things do not neglect your mind body or spirit invest time and energy in all of them equally it will be the best investment you ever make not just for your life but for whatever is to follow

2696492 sesungguhnya setan itu memantau kondisi hati anak adam jika ia lalai dari dzikir maka dia menggoda waswasa jika ia dzikrullah maka setan akan menjauh khanasa
2696493 yang dimaksud dzikir adalah thaatullah maka barangsiapa yang taat kepada allah maka dia tengah berdzikir kepada allah dan barangsiapa yang bermaksiat maka dia tidak dikatakan berdzikir meskipun ia banyak membaca tasbih dan tahlil
2696494 banyak orang yang menghadiri majelis dzikir ikut menangis dan menampakkan kekhusyuan tapi di luar itu mereka tidak meninggalkan praktik riba curang dalam jual beli tidak membenahi kekurangannya dalam memahami rukun rukun islam tidak berhenti menggunjing dan mendurhakai orang tua mereka adalah orang orang yang diperdaya oleh iblis sehingga mereka beranggapan bahwa majelis dzikir itu bisa menghapus dosa dosa mereka
2696495 dan ingatlah kepada rabb mu di dalam hatimu dengan merendahkan diri dan merasa takut dengan tidak meninggikan suaramu
2696496 wahai orang orang yang beriman ingatlah kepada allah sebanyak banyaknya dan bertasbihlah kepda nya pada pagi dan petang hari
2696497 jika kalian melewati kebun kebun syurga maka nikamtilah oleh kalian para sahabat ra bertanya wahai rasulullah apakah kebun syurga itu jawab nabi saw yaitu majelis majelis dzikir karena allah memiliki malaikat malaikat yang selalu mencari majelis majelis dzikir apabila mereka menemukannya maka mereka akan duduk bersama bersama orang yang berdzikir itu
2696498 rasul saw keluar dari rumahnya menuju sebuah majlis tempat berkumpul para sahabatnya lalu beliau bersabda mengapa kalian duduk duduk bersama disini jawab mereka kami disini bertahmid atas hidayah dan nikmat yang telah diberikan nya kepada kami sehingga kami memeluk agama islam kata nabi saw demi allah apakah benar kalian duduk disini hanya karena itu aku tidak minta kalian bersumpah tapi jibril telah datang kepadaku dan meberitahukan bahwa allah swt telah membanggakan kalian dihadapan para malaikat
2696499 tiada suatu kaum yang duduk duduk sambil berdzikir pada allah melainkan para malaikat datang berkumpul dan rahmat allah meliputi mereka dan ketentraman turun kepada mereka dan nama nama mereka disebutkan satu persatu oleh allah swt dihadapan para malaikat yang ada disisi nya
2696500 dan jangan kamu nyaringkan suaramu ketika shalat dan jangan pula kamu merendahkannya tetapi hendaklah kamu lakukan diantara keduanya
2696501 dan orang orang yang berdzikir kepada allah sambil berdiri duduk dan berbaring dan mereka memikirkan penciptaan langit dan bumi
2696502 rasulullah saw bersandar dipangkuanku sedangkan aku dalam keadaan haidh dan beliau membaca
2696503 ada 2 kalimat yang sangat ringan di lidah sangat berat dalam timbangan amal dan sangat dicintai oleh ar rahman yaitu subhanallahi wabihamdihi subahanallahil azhim 1
2696504 barangsiapa mengucapkan la ilaha illallahu wahdahu la syarikalahu lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala syaiin qadir setiap hari 100 kali maka bagaikan ia memerdekakan 10 orang budak dan diberikan 100 kebaikan dan dihapuskan 100 keburukannya dan syaithan tidak bisa mendekatinya pada hari itu sampai sore dan tidak ada seorang yang lebih baik darinya kecuali yang membaca lebih banyak darinya juga dikatakan barangsiapa yang mengatakansubhanallah wa bihamdihi setiap hari 100 kali maka dihapuskan dosa dosanya walaupun sebanyak buih di lautan 2
2696505 kebersihan itu sebagian dari iman mengucapkan alhamdulillah itu memenuhi timbangan kebaikan mengucapkan subahanallah wal hamdulillah itu memenuhi langit dan bumi 3
2696506 adalah nabi saw jika selesai salam dari shalatnya beliau saw membaca istighfar 3 kali lalu membaca allahumma antas salamu wa minkas salamu tabarakta ya dzal jalali wal ikram 4
2696507 adalah nabi saw jika selesai shalat membaca la ilaha illallah wahdahu la syarikalahu lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wahuwa ala kulli syaiin qadir allahumma la mania lima athaita wa muthiya lima manata wala yanfau dzal jaddi minkal jaddu 5

2696515 they contain dense proteins that these nasty bacteria use as a fuel source to create odors
2696516 when one diets saliva is diminished so there is less natural protection
2696517 high protein diets are a problem because the bacteria create odors by breaking down amino acids in proteins
2696518 saliva contains a high percentage of oxygen which is the natural enemy of anaerobic bacteria
2696519 when one sleeps there is no saliva production so you literally have a sulfur factory in your mouth for seven to eight hours since there is no natural saliva or oxygen to fight the anaerobic bacteria
2696520 the northern territory election is reminder to all of us in politics that the australian people will hold us accountable

2696538 this is an accomplished and original production which lightly splashes de rigueur pop culture touchstones a particular highlight is the montage of famous film montages with more esoteric references such as the marriage of figaro but its rooted in the traditions of barbershop music and is a delight to hear and see in such an intimate environment
2696539 musically inventive cleverly choreographed and overwhelmingly funny barbershopera expands not just the vocabulary of english but the capacity of musical theatre to offer genuine entertainment of the hundreds of a cappella rocky montages ive witnessed none come even close to that of toni amp the guys
2696540 today if someone tried a similar stunt he or she would be condemned by health experts psychologists and parents groups for setting a dangerous example we need this film to remind us that there are things worth dying for and dancing on the rooftop of the world is one of them

2696630 there has been a lot of criticism of him not doing it sooner but he wanted to see how things would pan out
2696631 my view is that in terms of those he showed strength in that he was prepared to walk away and let it flounder
2696632 it may manifest itself now as a reality check for all the parties involved peoples expectations will have to be tempered
2696633 in august he wants them all to reflect on the realities of life he will be asking them to give leadership to whom they represent in terms of what we want to do and how we can achieve it

2696690 the sport of disembodied flight among the stars must surely be the most exhilarating of all athletic exercises it is not without danger but its danger as we son discovered was psychological not physical in our bodiless state collision with celestial objects mattered little sometimes in the early stages of our adventure we plunged by accident headlong into a star its interior would of course be inconceivably hot but we experienced merely brilliance the psychological dangers of the sport were grave we soon discovered that disheartenment mental fatigue fear all tended to reduce our powers of movement more than once we found ourselves immobile in space like a derelict ship on the ocean and such was the fear roused by this plightthat there was sno possibility of moving till having experienced the whole gamut of despair we passed through indifference and on into philosophic calm

2696697 hes got to know all our prospects hes got to know our team hes got to know the significant amateur players hes got to know the existing pro players
2696698 its not possible for him to see everybody on the pro and amateur side but he has to know the players of interest on the pro and amateur side hes going to be on special assignments he has a list of things he has to check off through the course of the year
2696699 when i ask what do you think of player x in our organization or what about player y in another organization hes already built up quite a large library based on his amateur stuff this allows him to increase his portfolio
2696700 they project how these guys are going to be but they never get to truly see how these guys will be in their pro stage its a very good process hes going through to contribute at the pro stage also it will make him even better at what hes doing
2696701 our ahl team has been a very integral part of our success on the nhl level over the last five years and we expect kevin to continue this tradition
2696702 hes familiar with portland and his coaching record and player development skills the past three years in the ahl are very important to our organization
2696703 you only have seven rounds now so theres a reduction in the amount of players selected
2696704 now you have tier 2 players and high school players that may not have gotten drafted before when you had nine rounds a guy might have been an eighth round pick now he goes undrafted
2696705 we want to make sure we have a full player pool
2696706 we do have a course of action and we will follow through at some point but that hasnt begun yet
2696707 dont ignore the skill and dont ignore the player that stands out but try and find something in these players that epitomizes a bruin for me its work ethic night in and night out competitiveness and character thats my message to the staff

2696736 this is a small victory for my people when it comes to sport we will always remain friends and nothing will come between our friendship even if it is in such a scary event as shooting
2696737 the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship we have had so many big wars in the 20th century what we need is peace that is something politics can learn from sport
2696738 our embrace should show that politics can learn from sport

2696743 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2696744 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2696745 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2696746 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2696747 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2696748 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2696749 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2696750 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2696751 mattias sieben rennen sind gefahren was hat dich in dieser saison bisher am meisten berrascht
2696752 ich glaube das war unsere leistung im ersten rennen dass der neue audi a4 im verh ltnis zur konkurrenz so gut war und dass wir am ersten wochenende schon so stark waren das war sicher die gr te berraschung des jahres und die beste
2696753 damit hattet ihr ja gleich einen guten einstieg in die saison
2696754 ja denn man hat immer ein gewisses kribbeln im bauch wenn man mit einem neuen auto antritt so war das auch in diesem jahr ich war nicht so sicher wie gut das auto wirklich ist aber in hockenheim waren wir sehr gut dabei und es war wirklich toll dass das auto von anfang an so gut war
2696755 man hat immer ein gewisses kribbeln im bauch wenn man mit einem neuen auto antritt
2696756 und was hat dich in dieser saison bisher am meisten ge rgert
2696757 da muss ich jetzt wirklich berlegen also momentan f llt mir nichts ein was mich wirklich ge rgert hat allerdings rgere mich auch nur sehr selten und bisher gab es keinen anlass dazu das einzige war vielleicht dass ich in oschersleben in der ersten kurve einen kleinen unfall hatte der unn tig war aber sonst nein da f llt mir nichts ein
2696758 warum ist der neue a4 deiner meinung nach so gut
2696759 die fahrbarkeit er ist sehr leicht zu fahren und man kann ihn im grenzbereich sehr gut beherrschen das ist f r mich der hauptgrund warum das auto so gut ist
2696760 es ist also eine verbesserung im vergleich zum 2007er auto
2696761 jedes jahr wird das auto besser aber vom 2007er zum neuen a4 ist schon ein verh ltnism ig sehr gro er schritt gelungen
2696762 vier rennen stehen noch aus im titelkampf in wem siehst du den sch rferen gegner timo scheider oder jamie green
2696763 da w rde ich noch abwarten wie es nach dem rennen in brands hatch aussieht es geht ruckzuck irgendetwas passiert und dann sieht die situation wieder ganz anders aus ich wei dass jamie sehr gut ist und auch timo ist stark aber grunds tzlich w rde ich noch abwarten mit prognosen wenn nur noch drei rennen zu fahren sind kann man schon eher etwas sagen jetzt w re es noch einen tick zu fr h daf r
2696764 ich wei dass jamie sehr gut ist und auch timo ist stark
2696765 vor dem rennen am norisring wurde schon ein bisschen in die richtung spekuliert dass du nun f r timo fahren musst hast du davon etwas mitbekommen und was hast du dar ber gedacht
2696766 ja nach dem wochenende am norisring haben alle gedacht dass ich ihn absichtlich vorbeigelassen habe das hat nat rlich nicht gestimmt aber es ist halt so dass die leute so etwas glauben wollen ansonsten habe ich davon nichts mitbekommen und nach meinem sieg in zandvoort habe ich davon sowieso kein wort mehr geh rt
2696767 w rdest du denn f r timo fahren wenn die situation sich so ergeben w rde
2696768 wenn es im interesse von audi ist fahre ich f r jeden egal ob das timo ist oder martin tomczyk oder tom kristensen ich hatte schon das vergn gen f r viele gute teamkollegen zu fahren f r laurent aiello f r tom das hat mir auch spa gemacht solange man selbst mittendrin im meisterschaftskampf ist macht man es nat rlich nicht aber jetzt warten wir mal ab wie die situation nach brands hatch ist
2696769 vor dem rennen in zandvoort wurde das reglement f r die jahreswagen gewichte ge ndert werden sie euch jetzt gef hrlicher oder ist der abstand immer noch gro genug oder macht man sich als fahrer eines neuwagens ber so etwas gar keine gedanken
2696770 ich mache mir wenig gedanken ber die verschiedenen jahrg nge denn konkurrenz machen einem alle je nach strecken gibt es bei allen autos unterschiedliche st rken oder schw chen ich w rde sagen dass gary paffett auf gewissen strecken besonders stark war und oliver jarvis auch ab und zu werden sie uns so oder so gef hrlich
2696771 ganz anderes thema was machst du in der langen pause bis brands hatch
2696772 ich bleibe zu hause in der schweiz und treibe ein bisschen sport ich habe mir vorgenommen nicht allzu viel stress zu haben nur sport zu machen und den urlaub zu hause zu genie en ich habe es sehr sch n am bodensee und deshalb bleibe ich auch dort
2696773 ich mache immer viel sport und verbringe viel zeit mit meinem hund
2696774 ja ich betreue es allerdings nicht selbst sondern das machen die teammitglieder in schweden ich unterst tze sie schon aber so viel zeit habe ich nicht daf r
2696775 du konzentrierst dich wie schon im vergangenen jahr voll auf den titelkampf
2696776 ja volle attacke hei t es jetzt bei mir ich fahre auch vorerst keine rallyes oder so etwas

2696812 i grew up wanting to be a lieutenant commander in the navy air corps
2696813 i attained that fairly early in my life and i never even thought about ever being afraid of flying it was one of the most natural things i ever did one of the easiest things i ever did
2696814 i always wanted to fly airplanes and this was just a better airplane
2696815 i think its been one of the most successful government agencies in history
2696816 i think its one of the most significant events in history
2696817 while we didnt fly a historic mission we had a part in history
2696818 i think of it as a little footnote in the program where we landed a man on the moon
2696819 it has changed the way we look at the universe
2696820 it was very satisfying having done that after seeing what happened to the prior mission
2696821 we were worried that an unsuccessful flight or something that went wrong could cause the public to sour on spaceflight
2696822 every nasa employee feels that they killed seven astronauts on that mission even though we had nothing to do with it
2696823 i was listening for the boom and i didnt hear it and its not like an airline that is going to be five minutes late
2696824 as we see people going to the moon and finding new features and discoveries i think exploration of a planetary body is going to be exciting
2696825 the areas that were looking at for an outpost are dramatic in nature
2696826 its not like the apollo sites where they landed in smooth terrain these areas will be very dramatic in their elevation and i think theyll be very exciting
2696827 theres still much to be learned at the moon that we werent able to do in three day missions
2696828 embedded in the soil of the moon are solar wind particles that scientists can find and they tell them the history of our sun
2696829 part of the reason were going to the moon is to learn to operate in a hostile environment on a planetary body
2696830 everything that were doing is a step in that direction and so we look forward to that in the future
2696831 i dont think that nasa is what it was in the golden age

2696833 it is important that we inform missourians about the dangers of alcohol abuse and drunk driving
2696834 in missouri if someone chooses to get behind the wheel while intoxicated they are not only putting others at risk they are choosing to face very serious consequences that could impact their driving privileges

2696837 all sides must remember that attacks on civilians or acts intended to terrorize civilians clearly violate international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes

2696905 dearest ddv were planning a new compilation featuring violent music would you like to contribute if you would please record 3 tracks of not more than 4 minutes each from which one will be selected for inclusion when you are ready i will send you the contract terms i must know your decision by feb 26th and the music must be delivered by march 5th anyway i look forward to hearing from you soon best regards yours william bennett
2696906 we produce exquisite and extraordinary works of music and art whose comprehension will violently challenge to the fragile core of a naked soul

2696908 you know i dont know but theres a funny feeling just knocking on the horizon and i wonder what if the next moment wouldnt come but there would be an other moment coming apologizing in the name of the next moment which couldnt come and then you have to accept the situation youre sitting here in the afternoon gloom with no friends no love no values no money no prospects and you were about to think that maybe you should change your behavior be nicer to the neighbour a dog or just think nicer things and then in the midst of all this waiting for your next martini looking the legs of those girls who will eventually leave you now well here you are facing the next after moment that came to tell you the very next moment had some other things to do something was more important than you again and im sure you couldnt do better you have to sit here waiting for a moment its humiliating its just a little moment and which is more not even the right one so it should be easy to say something hello for instance but here you are looking for a word and you wont find it the next moment got inside itself

2696913 but i wont deny that there is a problem between us there has been this kind of animosity between us for a long time in fact this is the third time we have fought we have tried being friends but it just doesnt seem possible we are different people
2696914 no why should i not interested we are two different individuals he may be a great person but his values and scruples are not the same as mine i cant continue being a buddy to someone i dont get along with i am not the kind who would pretend to be great friends with someone and then back bite about the person
2696915 my show is not like dus karod referring to srks kaun banega crorepati where there may be some ghapla people end up winning phenomenal amounts i would be the last person to support something like this people in my show get out after having won just about a lakh but its genuine
2696916 its sad but thats how life goes his way of thinking is totally different from mine doesnt look like we can be friends
2696917 it makes sense for call centre workers to meet other call centre workers because they understand each others pressures and what the job is really about apart from anything else someone who works night shifts and sleeps during the day needs a partner with similar patterns of hours to socialise with
2696918 they buy the latest gadgets they eat well they go for movies at 2 am its high living high spending because they earn well and have no responsibilities this wont be compatible with someone who is cautious and wants security

2696976 now while we wont make a lot of money off that it allows us to take the risk at the earliest investment with promising companies with ideas that if they meet their milestones we can go in with our own money later
2696977 the state gave us the maximum we asked for which we take as a validation of what we are doing
2696978 were excited about this and the fact that we got a portion of this money and it didnt go all to cleveland or columbus is very good news for cincinnati
2696979 its a good deal to give these kinds of early startup companies a chance
2696980 we would see that an idea was interesting and that the entrepreneur was promising but was too early to make a judgment call with a sizeable amount of money
2696981 this enables promising entrepreneurs to validate their ideas and achieve milestones that prove the idea and the company has substance then we can go in and make our normal investments

2697012 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2697013 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2697014 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2697015 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2697016 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2697017 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2697018 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2697019 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2697042 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger they need to succeed
2697043 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
2697044 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2697045 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the european cup
2697046 it doesnt matter that manchester united beat us in the last match they are different games they need different approaches
2697047 this will be nothing like that game things are different now and we have the chance to win
2697048 weve had good preparation for the pre season and now we really want to win this first match at wembley
2697049 of course we will approach this game very differently to nigeria we have to be a lot more committed we have to play and work hard and make sure we do our best

2697060 all the schooling he hitler ever knew would come from the local priests most of the peasants were illiterate
2697061 adolf was admitted to the school attached to the benedictine monastery and was immediately fascinated by the new world of church ritual the black robed monks the abbot ruling his flock with all the authority of an earthly king
2697062 there was thus no trace of anti clericalism in the family for two years adolf contemplated the possibility of one day joining the community of monks eventually rising to the position of abbot with supreme authority over all the monks
2697063 the poor boy regarded the priest as the embodiment of all humanly attainable heights
2697064 as was only natural the abbot seemed to me as the village priest had once seemed to my father the highest and most desirable ideal
2697065 she was one of those women who lived for their husbands their children and their faith
2697066 adolf could see the swastika from the window of his fathers apartment and he saw it more clearly when he went to school abbot theodorich von hagens swastika was probably the ancestor of the nazi hakenkreuz
2697067 i sometimes picked up the volksblatt a roman catholic anti semitic newspaper i was not in agreement with the sharp anti semitic tone but from time to time i read arguments which gave me some food for thought at all events these occasions slowly made me acquainted with the man and the movement which in those days guided viennas destinies dr karl lueger and the christian social party when i arrived in vienna i was hostile to both of them the man and the movement seemed reactionary in my eyes my common sense of justice however forced me to change this judgment in proportion as i had occasion to become acquainted with the man and his work and slowly my fair judgment turned to unconcealed admiration today more than ever i regard this man as the greatest german mayor of all times how many of my basic principles were upset by this change in my attitude toward the christian socialist movement my views with regard to anti semitism thus succumbed to the passage of time and this was my greatest transformation of all
2697068 it protestantism fails however in the moment when this defense of national interests must take place in a province which is either absent from the general line of its ideological world and traditional development or is for some reason rejected
2697069 thus protestantism will always stand up for the advancement of all germanism as such as long as matters of inner purity or national deepening as well as german freedom are involved since all these things have a firm foundation in its own being but it combats with the greatest hostility any attempt to rescue the nation from the embrace of its most mortal enemy since its attitude toward the jews just happens to be more or less dogmatically established
2697070 in this the catholic church can be regarded as a model example the celibacy of its priests is a force compelling it to draw the future generation again and again from the masses of the broad people instead of from their own ranks but it is this very significance of celibacy that is not at all recognized by most people
2697071 a hermit by deliberate choice adolf despised homosexuals as much as he despised the women he sometimes encountered at the opera who indicated that they would welcome his advances his proud disdainful appearance made him attractive to women but he took pleasure in rebuffing them
2697072 for how shall we fill people with blind faith in the correctness of a doctrine if we ourselves spread uncertainty and doubt by constant changes in its outward structure
2697073 here too we can learn by the example of the catholic church through its doctrinal edifice and in part quite superfluously comes into collision with exact science and research it is none the less unwilling to sacrifice so much as one little syllable of its dogmas it has recognized quite correctly that its power of resistance does not lie in its lesser or greater adaptation to the scientific findings of the moment which in reality are always fluctuating but rather in rigidly holding to dogmas once established for it is only such dogmas which lend to the whole body the character of a faith
2697074 himmler had discovered from history an example on which he proposed to model his order the jesuits
2697075 the himmlers had always been loyal and devout catholics himmler was a practicing catholic and sunday mass was more than an outward ritual for him it was a spiritual experience
2697076 come what may i shall always love god shall pray to him and shall remain faithful to the catholic church and shall defend it even if i should be expelled from it
2697077 in 1930 through arrangements with kaas pacelli met with heinrich bruning a prominent member of the catholic center party who had been elected chancellor of the fragile new german government that had been formed by a coalition between the socialists and catholics during the meeting in the vatican pacelli lectured bruning on the virtue of granting adolf hitler a prominent place in the cabinet to pave the way for a concordant between the government and the holy see hitler after all had been born and raised a catholic had attended monastery school and had even expressed his desire to become a priest when bruning balked at the suggestion pacelli fell into a temper tantrum insisting that if bruning failed to cooperate kaas would have to resign as president of the catholic center party leaving the new chancellor without key political support more pressure was applied to the catholic center party to come to terms with the nazis in 1932 bruning was replaced as chancellor by franz von papen a distinguished papal knight and leading member of the center party
2697078 at the urgings of kaas von papen persuaded german president paul von hindenburg who looked upon the nazis with complete disdain to call upon hitler for the creation of a new cabinet hindenburg reluctantly consented and on january 30 1933 hitler became the new chancellor of germany his first act was to name von papen the new vice chancellor the nazis thanks to the clandestine workings of the vatican had gained control of the government
2697079 europe needs some kind of authoritarian government formerly it was the monarch who provided this authority or an institution like the catholic church the holy roman empire is an example
2697080 one should realize that roman catholic hostility to rightist totalitarian states is not hostility to totalitariansim as such where the state will recognize the rights of the papacy the papacy will cooperate with that state even though it is totalitarian the papacy supported the dictatorships of franco in spain it also came to terms with hitler in germany by a concordant in 1933
2697081 i do not believe that after the recently expressed and publicly promulgated dogmas of the catholic church it is possible for a secular power to arrive at a concordant without that power to some degree or in some manner losing face this the german reich cannot accept at all
2697082 pius xii also saw in the axis a new way to expand his spiritual domain to the east
2697083 in addition it offered the church untold riches in the form of a kirchensteuer or
2697084 before god and on the holy gospels i swear and promise as becomes a bishop loyalty to the german reich and to the state in the performance of my spiritual office and in my solicitude for the welfare and the interests of the german reich i will endeavor to avoid all detrimental acts which might endanger it
2697085 the fact that the vatican is concluding a treaty with the new germany means the acknowledgement of the national socialist state by the catholic church the treaty shows the whole world clearly and unequivocally that the assertion that national socialism is hostile to religion is a lie
2697086 we knew enough to contrast pius xiis silence in relation to nazism with his forthright condemnation of communism including his 1949 excommunication
2697087 if pius xii had done what his critics in hindsight wish him to have done excommunication of hitler revocation of the concordant
2697088 no catholic born nazi not goebbels himmler or bormann not even adolf hitler was ever excommunicated for being a nazi
2697089 give your servant an understanding mind and a hearing heart to judge your people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge and rul this your great people
2697090 then i did the simplest thing in the world i leaned down and kissed him and the world cracked open
2697091 he who marries does not sin but he who does not marry does even better
2697092 on the basis of the thorough probe that we conducted in 2003 2004 i can say with confidence that neither the pakistan army nor any of the past governments of pakistan was ever involved or had any knowledge of a q s proliferation activities the show was completely aqs

2697105 the pace of chinese progress will slacken as it gets nearer to the technological frontier i have assumed that per capita income will grow at an average rate of 4 5 a year between 2003 and 2030 but that the rate of advance will taper off over the period specifically i assume a rate of 5 6 to 2010 4 6 between 2010 and 2020 and a little more than 3 6 a year from 2020 to 2030 by then in our scenario it will have reached the same per capita level as western europe and japan around 1990 when their catch up process had ceased as it approaches this level technical advance will be more costly as imitation is replaced by innovation however by 2030 the technical frontier will have moved forward so there will still be some scope for catch up thereafter with such a performance china should overtake the united states as the world s biggest economy before 2015 and by 2030 account for about a quarter of world gdp it would have a per capita income like that of western europe in 1990 its per capita income would be only one third of that in the united states but its role in the world economy and its geopolitical leverage would certainly be much greater

2697113 normally at the start of a season you wouldnt want to risk any players not michael owen or alan smith if there is a doubt i will leave them out
2697114 it will be michael or myself who will decide if he is fit enough to come into a premier league game
2697115 mr robson is a winner all his life he has been a winner
2697116 when he was born as he grew his history as a football player as a manager against his illness hes a winner for ever
2697117 he taught me to be ready to fight for everything you love for everything you believe in
2697118 he enjoys life so much hell fight and ill be at his side always he is fantastic and has made his mark on me as a person and a friend
2697119 for me more important than the manager is the person when i worked with him he spoke a lot about the england job but the only moment i realized exactly what he was talking about was when i was living and working in england
2697120 then i realized how difficult it would be to be england manager for eight years and do it so well
2697121 his career deserved a world cup final but he just did not have that little bit of luck that if youre going to be winners of big competitions you need
2697122 but his career was absolutely beautiful every day is a day of passion for him and he will for ever be a legend in england and particularly at the clubs where he left his mark
2697123 i have accepted what they have told me and i am determined to make the most of what time i have left
2697124 i am going to die sooner rather than later but then everyone has to go some time and i have enjoyed every minute
2697125 i have been fortunate to survive this long it is thanks to the doctors and their dedication
2697126 he was here thats for sure i like his hair its like mine in the seventies but i cant tell you any more than that
2697127 id like to think that once the coloccini deal is completed then two more players will arrive and then well see what happens
2697128 i think therell be a lot of comings and goings late on as clubs try to re balance and somebody will come available who will be of interest
2697129 i think well be in there pitching just like everybody else

2697156 at the moment i am not close to concluding any transfer deal because i am too busy here
2697157 maybe next week something can happen but for now we have to focus on the champions league and forget about transfers because it is a big target for us
2697158 i do not rule anybody completely out at the moment so everything is possible
2697159 i am confident and have belief the team will be focused and treat twente with respect
2697160 we have learned through our experience and i am confident we can qualify
2697161 you always expect good opposition in holland but i believe we are good enough to get through
2697162 today we were very young but i in the end we learned what it is like to defend what we are not used to and in the end it was a good lesson for us
2697163 overall i am pleased because we lacked a bit of experience but we got a positive result with 1 1 even if overall sevilla had many more chances
2697164 he is an exciting player and feel he is still not there physically
2697165 at the moment he is with us and we have no formal offer from anybody
2697166 there is interest here and there but nothing concrete i may let one or two go on loan because they need to play it is part of education
2697167 it is not especially to get premiership experience but to play in the first team every week with that pressure
2697168 then when we feel they are ready to integrate in the first team they come back
2697169 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2697170 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so

2697177 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger they need to succeed
2697178 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
2697179 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2697180 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the
2697181 this will be nothing like that game things are different now and we have the chance to win
2697182 weve had good preparation for the pre season and now we really want to win this first match at
2697183 of course we will approach this game very differently to nigeria we have to be a lot more committed we have to play and work hard and make sure we do our best
2697184 they are a very good side but i believed we would win the fa cup if i didnt believe i would not play football you cannot just give up
2697185 even the one sack there was nothing to it i felt just fine out there
2697186 you dont want to go have happened what happened in the game
2697187 he gets hit pretty good on the deep ball that ended up being a pass interference call once you survive that you understand that its pretty good that it happened because you have to be able to play through those things i thought he did the things he needed to do
2697188 you start with a three and out and obviously you want to get it going early
2697189 we bounced right back and got the ball in the end zone twice preseason you want to stay away from penalties which we did you want to protect the football which we did thus far through the first half
2697190 there are some things i need to clean up of course but i felt real good out there doing the assignments that were asked of me what people expect of me i want to back that up some more and keep coming out and doing those things
2697191 the very first guy i was blocking was zach thomas
2697192 that guy has been to so many pro bowls it felt good once you do that nothing really worries you anymore youre taking on a pro bowler like that it was a good experience
2697193 practice you go through it and you really cant make contact and make good runs
2697194 you dont know what to expect when you get out here once you get out here and get the pads on you really get a chance to show what you can do
2697195 i kind of went in there on my own and watched some film i saw that formation on 3 rd and short they had wide splits and he was wide so there wasnt really too much he could do i stayed patient and made the play
2697196 he showed up and played really well hes going to be a good player for us

2697215 they were stores of some type we just dont know what they were selling who was running them
2697216 we know that it was pretty secretive whatever it was that was down here because not too many people know anything about it
2697217 you know you just think of the underground as such a dark spooky place but to think that this could have maybe been some kind of vibrant economic center is just kind of baffling really
2697218 i think it would just be kind of tragic if no one knew what it was or if no one cared
2697219 schon eine lebensverl ngerung um ein paar monate w re f r diese menschen ein erfolg
2697220 da erkl rst du ihnen geduldig was die vor und nachteile eines tests sind
2697221 und zur antwort kriegst du herr doktor ich mache das was sie mir raten
2697222 bei mentalen krankheiten sei es selbst im riesigen indien nicht ganz einfach gen gend patienten f r eine testreihe zu finden also k nne man nicht nur auf einsa hospit ler zur ckgreifen sagt michael kracht der europa repr sentant von lambda einer der indischen contract research organisations cro die gegen gutes honorar im auftrag von pharmamultis aus aller welt tests organisieren
2697223 in der westlichen welt w rde es jahre dauern bis man testpersonen in ausreichender zahl beisammen h tte wenn sie berhaupt mitmachten
2697224 f r die mehrzahl der menschen hier bedeutet die teilnahme zum ersten mal im leben berhaupt zugang zu medikamenten und rztlicher versorgung zu bekommen
2697225 dass sich die mittel die ihnen der doktor verabreicht noch im versuchsstadium befinden ist f r sie zweitrangig
2697226 patienten sind nat rlich zum beispiel viel eher geneigt an einem trial f r ein krebsmittel teilzunehmen wenn der arzt ihnen sagt die neue droge k nne vielleicht ihr leben verl ngern als wenn er sehr nachdr cklich auf haarausfall belkeit oder m gliche innere blutungen hinweist
2697227 die dann verst ndlicherweise durch die presse gehen aber mindestens 99 prozent aller pharmatests laufen korrekt nach der vorgeschriebenen prozedur ab denn jede panne w re verheerend f r das image der hersteller das will ganz abgesehen von ethischen fragen doch niemand riskieren
2697228 we decided to look at the projects that we think are going to be applicable in the next two to five years and try to build an application for them
2697229 we love to get our stuff onto apple but they seem to want to lock it up
2697230 there is a technique to get content onto a mobile phone called sideloading because it doesnt come over the broadcast from the mobile network but through wi fi or a usb
2697231 its very much like a podcast but its for your favourite tv shows
2697232 were not a huge believer in mobile tv its another of these contribution cards we believe that broadcast content is best over a broadcast network that is designed for that and dvb h and media player stuff they sort of work but its not clear if they move beyond that
2697233 ad substitution when a third of the market has pvr like sky starts to become very interesting the people who have sky are already their own demographic and you mix in the type of household from postcodes and it really can be quite exciting
2697234 all of the internet techniques are completely valid for this type of advertising not necessarily within the same department but they will be able to educate themselves quickly if you look at all the money that is going towards internet advertising you can imagine advertisers picking up on this quickly
2697235 the principal is the same use the right device for the right thing
2697236 but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us we are hard pressed on every side but not crushed perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not abandoned struck down but not destroyed we always carry around in our body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be revealed in our body
2697237 eva owns beso in hollywood and is set to launch another in las vegas she asked victoria to come on board and help
2697238 victoria was thrilled and talked it through with her husband david but he thought she was spreading herself a bit thin
2697239 and should concentrate on what she was good at running a successful fashion line and looking after the family

2697289 wir sind bereit die ordnung herzustellen und noch weiter zu gehen wenn es von der georgischen seite widerstand gibt
2697290 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2697291 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2697292 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2697293 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2697294 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2697295 ich habe es so oft versucht wenn es sinnvoll w re w rde ich es tun aber ich habe so oft versagt das will keine krankenkasse mehr zahlen
2697296 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2697297 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2697298 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2697299 its time for barisan nasional to go and pakatan rakyat to rule

2697308 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur although the likelihood of them affecting any one individual is still very low
2697309 there are certain irreconcilables who could not be engaged you also have to do it through longer term ways of providing education for the people who might now study in radical madressahs study in schools that will teach them skills
2697310 you have to do it through the economic and social development of places like the federally administered tribal areas which are deadly poor really poor
2697311 there are elements in pakistan that one worries about and they had connections to the militants in the region but the country remains a strong us ally she added
2697312 there are also clearly efforts that we think are not working to have deals if you will or negotiated solutions to the militant problem but the point is that these militants are as deadly and dangerous for pakistan as they are for afghanistan
2697313 i think were taking a pretty bold stand and by the way the pakistanis themselves understand that they need to take a bolder stand
2697314 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday lives and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2697315 musharraf is required to obtain a fresh vote of confidence from parliament otherwise parliament being a sovereign and independent body has the option to exercise the right to impeach him
2697316 the people will soon get good news about the dawn of democracy in the country
2697317 parliament is sovereign and has the authority to take major decisions including impeachment of the president
2697318 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2697319 its a shift away from the drier books we all grew up with
2697320 sometimes relatively harmless bacteria can turn into a gruesome killer

2697325 the bravest boldest and most er potent knight in all the land
2697326 a quest to solve the riddle of the foul west wind a ghastly odor that turns up whenever dangers lurking
2697327 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games
2697328 the goal of our organisation and of the vast majority of uighurs around the world is to peacefully resolve the problems facing uighurs in east turkistan
2697329 we advocate the principle of non violence and the promotion of freedom democracy and human rights through peaceful means we also sincerely hope for a peaceful olympic games

2697345 alles aufzuschreiben war eine chance f r mich diese aufregende zeit noch einmal zu durchleben
2697346 ich wollte einfach schildern wie es wirklich ist nicht alle huren sind zwangsprostituierte sondern viele machen es freiwillig und manchmal macht es sogar spa

2697351 ich denke probleme wie zwangsprostitution muss man an der wurzel bek mpfen eine frau die in ihrer heimat die m glichkeit hat ihre familie zu ern hren sich zu entwickeln wird nicht auf die idee kommen einem dubiosen typen 5000 euro zu geben damit der sie nach deutschland oder westeuropa schleust wo sie ausgenutzt wird

2697361 everything around it to win like that under those expectations and pressure its kind of amazing
2697362 oh man were pretty close well this is going to be a fun last 200
2697363 i dont think ive ever really heard michael being this outspoken about how good he feels
2697364 which is a little bit scary i roomed with michael phelps in 2004 and he wasnt like that at all he didnt talk like that this time around its really surprising to see him talking about how good he feels

2697742 i have found your podcasts to be informative educational and entertaining in fact i got a pair of dress shoes repaired after listening to one of your podcasts thanks i saved some money that day
2697743 when the politicians complain that tv turns the proceedings into a circus it should be made clear that the circus was already there and that tv has merely demonstrated that not all the performers are well trained
2697744 the truth about these issues lies somewhere in the middle
2697745 this is a lot of people even for new york
2697746 im just a little more relaxed trying to stay within myself and not press
2697747 i was maybe pressing a little bit the first time out but the past two nights have definitely been a lot more comfortable for me
2697748 its always disappointing but its my first bad outing in a long time since the all star break
2697749 i felt like i made some good pitches and got out of the second inning i am not too upset about it you move on and i have already done that i am not going to look too much into it
2697750 i dont worry about the words as much as the action
2697751 when he came out of the game i could see he was upset with the way he pitched
2697752 its a sense you get on the mound every time i throw the ball to first they go back and every time i go home they are running
2697753 after the end of this year i was ready to say that was it
2697754 fifteen months ago i was playing some of the best hockey ive played in 10 years so i have a lot in my tank
2697755 a lot of youth and were going to expect a lot out of them
2697756 i made good pitches threw strikes and they hit it
2697757 i dont think i have seen that seven runs before an out
2697758 bubba talked about how we had to get our hands right
2697759 he said better get your hands ready so i did i went into weight room and did a little finger strengthening exercise to get ready for practice
2697760 you cant simulate what he does one thing i would say is that i see why hes great he has a lot more touch than people think
2697761 i think hes trying to feel his way and hasnt let it out
2697762 it will take a little time to get adjusted but well be fine
2697763 i always thought it was from my father but now i think i got it from my mother she got mad at me last summer and threw a pastrami sandwich and hit me in the head hard she really had something on that sandwich
2697764 you can call it a miracle or a legend or whatever you want to
2697765 i just know that on that day brett favre was larger than life
2697766 we probably couldnt have acquired better than what hes done
2697767 he made a couple of mistakes but i thought he had real good stuff its good to have a guy come up and show you that kind of power arm
2697768 ive never experienced anything like that its still kind of a dream for me
2697769 he looks like hes getting into one of those streaks
2697770 i come to the ball park every day to try to feel good at the plate and this was one of those days where i saw the ball good and i was capable to put the ball in play
2697771 when he can hit a 96 mph pitch out of the park in center field thats impressive
2697772 you knew he was going to heat up at some point hes too good of a player not to
2697773 hes been the guy here for eight years and now hes going to a rival team in miami
2697774 theres going to be a lot of excitement going into that first game with a lot of comparisons its going to be fun to be a part of
2697775 well hes a good player and were going to face a lot of good players
2697776 hes definitely got some insight into the things we do but were a very gameplan specific team
2697777 players go to different places all the time and theres definitely an element you have got to be more conscious of code words and things like that
2697778 well every time ive faced chad ive lost id just like to beat the guy for a change
2697779 i hope this time is different i have nothing but the highest regard for chad hes an extremely bright guy
2697780 the knock on him was his arm wasnt that strong so what i can throw it through a wall but i dont win every game i play in it doesnt matter he was very effective
2697781 i just dont think him leaving the packers and going to the jets was a great thing because you never know with them
2697782 great quarterback i just dont know if that was a smooth idea
2697783 not saying hes going to something bad because i really dont know what the jets got this year but i think he had a pretty good thing with the packers
2697784 but if they didnt want him back they didnt want him back
2697785 thats good for them now they got the expectations so thats probably less media in our locker room and thats probably better for us
2697786 he got the broadway sign now they got to deal with it i think hes going to realize the medias a little different in green bay hes not going to control it
2697787 i think everybody knows in new york that doesnt last long you have to produce thats why its such a great city to play for
2697788 i know our offensive line weve talked wed be happy to take brett out and show him all the fine restaurants as long as he pays for the bill
2697789 its a pretty difficult offense to learn and im sure the one ive been in the last 16 years has been difficult too itll take some time but i think well be fine
2697790 i dont have the real number but theyre saying its just under 10 000
2697791 the arm strength is everything you heard it would be and probably more
2697792 i didnt want to look too bad so i tried to put as much into it as i could and ill pay for it tomorrow but ill be ok
2697793 hell toss a ball 60 yards down the field with three defenders on a single receiver but if theres a slight chance of the guy catching it hell do it hell take the risk but he wants the reward
2697794 bumped the price up 500 more but i still bought em anyways
2697795 im an original season ticket holder from the titans in 1962
2697796 the old shea i remember the little jet on the field way back when ive had this jersey for 20 years
2697797 decided to save money for the personal seat licenses by doing it this way
2697798 im looking forward to seeing the ball being passed downfield something that weve been lacking for the past couple of years

2697878 music is my life politics my mistresss the story of oscar brown jr
2697879 it was my first start in anaheim but in my head i had done it a thousand times
2697880 i have been on the other side of that as a reliever
2697881 it was emotional when i went out there to stretch to see my family in the stands
2697882 i came into the dugout and got some fist pounds and aldred walked up to me and told me i was done
2697883 i asked why he was pulling my leg but he just went to the bullpen and got the next guy up then trenton manager tony franklin came up to me and said i did a nice job i said to him jokingly what did you trade me and he said yeah maybe we did
2697884 then i walked in the clubhouse looked up at the tv and saw my name on espn
2697885 i couldnt sleep til my phone rang at 9 a m my only thought was that i should start packing then franklin called me and said i was withdrawn from the trade as soon as i got off the phone i passed out until mark newman yankees vp of player development called me and told me the same thing
2697886 i didnt see him as anything special i have him triple a tops
2697887 his fastball was 88 92 with so so command and not a lot of movement a 79 84 curve and an average change
2697888 but maybe coming out of the pen that could change for him
2697889 i just need to make sure that i stay humble and continue to be myself really
2697890 youve seen guys that have gotten to levels and completely fallen apart im just trying to stay in my own mental program for what i have to do and if i do that i will be fine
2697891 they see that our young players are good players im amazed when people say we dont have prospects we didnt have the prospects to get johan santana we didnt have prospects after that trade but the thing about it is we have a whole bunch more prospects in the minors leagues that we like a lot and that is a credit to our scouts and development people
2697892 i can see hes not thinking about anything hes just going out there and seeing the ball hit the ball
2697893 all i can control is going out there and playing the game hard and being a smart baseball player

2698038 we have undergone massive bombardment this is to save the lives of the peaceful population
2698039 however efficient a ruler may be there is always someone isnt there who feels that his diet might be improved by some artificial additive such as arsenic many rulers have sought to avoid this this is one classical method
2698040 it could mean that no one is using the nt election as a guide it could mean that weve got the odds about right or it could mean that everybody is well and truly in olympic mode
2698041 people will judge harshly a government that calls an early election to avoid public scrutiny
2698042 mr carpenter called an early election to avoid people learning more about the labor government and its shady dealings through the corruption and crime commission
2698043 people dont like being used as pawns in the election process simply because the government wants to avoid scrutiny
2698044 we were effectively looking at a six to eight month election campaign stretched out in front of everybody where everything i was saying and doing and everything the ministers were saying and doing was being discounted as being said because an election was looming
2698045 we needed to get the situation sorted out to give us some certainty some clarity end the cynicism and thats what weve done
2698046 when this recruitment drive is complete we will take the total number of police in wa to a new record of almost 6 000
2698047 a liberal government will not allow the spreading of brothels throughout the suburbs and towns of wa
2698048 to take me out in the west desert and leave me
2698049 it was really neat just getting into the car at the hospital knowing that i was going home
2698050 and as we pulled into the driveway it was pretty emotional
2698051 i could go to another realm and explain what happened but doctors couldnt
2698052 during the week we were all pretty honest with ourselves as players and pretty much conceding that weve been letting each down over the last few weeks
2698053 regardless of whether we won or lost today i was very proud with the way the boys played and stuck together as a team
2698054 one good game doesnt really count for much youve got to do it every week
2698055 it was huge they made a break up the middle hes made that tackle and then hes turned up on the line
2698056 hes phenomenal hes been tremendous all year for us and what he did in that last five minutes is just indicative of his whole season the way he just keeps turning up and tries his heart out every week
2698057 we just didnt get a chance there we lost every 50 50 so added all together with our lacklustre energy we deserved to be beaten by a mile i reckon
2698058 i just dont think he maxwell did a good job i thought we were hammered really
2698059 it is where i was born my parents live there and i go back as often as i can and i will never not represent zimbabwe as long as im swimming
2698060 i guess when i stop swimming that is when ill stop representing zimbabwe
2698061 i was so excited last night that i only got to bed at 01 00am and had to get up at 06 00
2698062 ive learnt a lot but im the youngest in the field those guys are all 24 to 28 years of age i think london is my time
2698063 its a little bit hard to get going in the morning i dont think they had the swimmers at heart when they put the finals in the morning
2698064 i was one of the weak links but with this improvement i think gold is possible but silver is in our hands
2698065 i felt tired when i woke up perhaps it was the nerves
2698066 my stroke felt better yesterday my body just caved in over the final 10 metres but i came in seeded 18th and set a personal best so im happy with that
2698067 we have crossed three lakh units since inception in india to commemorate this achievement we are launching a sports variant of sedan civic

2698069 het volkskrantblog leidt regelmatig tot onverwachte verschijnselen zo heeft ook goedmakers vaker nieuwe toepassingen bedacht van dit blog hij poneerde een tijdlang stellingen waarop anderen konden reageren via het aanbevelingssysteem dat we hanteerden en nu kopieert hij een idee van de bbc door fotos z nder een onderschrift te plaatsen en zijn bezoekers uit te nodigen om daarbij het bijschrift te bedenken ik vind dit mooie ontwikkelingen ze tonen voor mij aan dat het volkskrantblog een eigen leven begint te leiden en dat het zich een plaats verovert in het leven van de gebruikers
2698070 my one great talent lies in making those who wrong me suffer horribly
2698071 there are some debts that should never have to be repaid some debts that are so clearly illegitimate or unpayable that countries should never be asked to honour them it is a matter of justice not mercy or charity

2698077 tengo una meta alta ac un gran sue o y ojal pueda repetir algo que hicimos con nicol s ese ha sido uno de mis mayores logros y s lo que es subir al podio y quiero obtener otra medalla para mi pa s
2698078 el primer partido siempre es el m s dif cil sobre todo con un jugador que no conoc a que estaba de local muy joven que no tiene nada que perder
2698079 entr con mucho cuidado y por suerte me sent bien
2698080 para mi las medallas valen todas iguales y hay que aprovechar todas tus posibilidades
2698081 hoy no hizo tanto calor pero la humedad era muy grande es muy inc modo para jugar
2698082 a los 10 minutos ya estaba goteando uno pierde mucho l quido la pelota iba muy lenta entonces es muy dif cil deber an poner el descanso de cada set m s largo o un descanso adicional
2698083 para mi los juegos ol mpicos son muy importantes traen medallas para tu pa s y son solamente cada cuatro a os as que es un evento m s que importante para m
2698084 me sent a un poco cansado por la presi n espero mejorar poco a poco e ir avanzando hasta llegar a la medalla de oro
2698085 todos los boxeadores vienen a los juegos muy bien preparados por eso lo importante es pensar en hacer mi pelea sin obsesionarme con el rival
2698086 la tradici n del boxeo cubano que siempre ocupa la cima en los juegos ol mpicos
2698087 grecia tiene un buen equipo pero nosotros tuvimos una mejor presentaci n estoy contento por haber ganado ya que en un torneo como los ol mpicos siempre es importante arrancar ganando
2698088 estamos arriba jugamos un buen partido y eso fue lo m s relevante grecia tiene un gran equipo e hicieron un buen trabajo pero nosotros nos quedamos con el triunfo en esta oportunidad
2698089 ellos tiraron de 24 11 desde la l nea de tiros libres y eso inclin la balanza a nuestro favor es verdad que de haber logrado un mejor porcentaje no les daba los puntos que necesitaban pero sin duda alguna que hubiera cambiado el ritmo del juego considerablemente
2698090 estados unidos tiene un equipo fuerte pero vamos a ver qu pasa porque nosotros tambi n tenemos un equipo con calidad demostrada
2698091 la defensa de nuestro equipo va a ser preponderante en lo que queramos hacer de ahora en adelante y creo que tenemos muchas opciones
2698092 es una buena sensaci n estar de nuevo en unos juegos ol mpicos el equipo est bien conformado y nosotros estamos en dar la batalla hasta el final
2698093 der schmerz ein bisschen gr er als das vergn gen
2698094 del ponte besa die information dass die familie kontakte zu karadzic unterhielt sie sagte der bosnischen polizei dass dies der weg sei sehr leicht an karadzic zu gelangen
2698095 offensichtlich besa dieselbe information auch die cia die karadzic nicht in den haag sehen wollte
2698096 jetzt wo karadzic endlich festgenommen worden ist kann er sehr viel ber die geheimabsprachen erz hlen die auch zum fall der uno schutzzone srebrenica im sommer 1995 gef hrt haben f r die westlichen gro m chte stellt seine aussage ein gro es risiko dar bisher hat es keine festen beweise daf r gegeben dass die westlichen staaten srebrenica f r die mitarbeit der serben am friedensprozess bergeben haben
2698097 sir you have to calm down we are doing everything we can for you
2698098 i am an apple farmer by trade he sighed from the time i was 20 till the day i do die i will forever have my apples
2698099 at age 20 i was saved i accepted the lord as my savior
2698100 the day i accepted the lord as my savior i got this basket and each time i had a problem or concern that i could not handle i put an apple in the basket un shined
2698101 because it reminded me to give those problems to the lord for him to shine see my basket now he stated as my problems disappear so do the apples as i get new problems ones i cannot handle alone i put an apple in
2698102 to the person who thinks enough of my son to buy this painting to this person i give my entire estate

2698107 we are ready to act independently we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2698108 i have asked russian peacekeepers to reinforce their military presence on the georgian abkhaz border contacts with the current leadership of georgia are impossible
2698109 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2698110 ill have a beer and pour another one for my friend down at the end there
2698111 im sorry sir but that guys a commie and we dont serve his kind around here
2698112 well youd better because if it werent for that guy i wouldnt be here you remember that mine that caved in well i was in that mine and so was that guy when the last of us were escaping he held the roof of the mine up with his head so get him a beer and if you dont believe me look at the top of his head and youll see that its flat from holding the roof up
2698113 i saw the flat spot on his head but i also couldnt help noticing the bruising under his chin what is that all about
2698114 people that work hard are going to do really well
2698115 those that are trying to stand still and tread water are going to have problems
2698116 and we focus on the midmarket the best part of the market
2698117 its harder to grow than enterprise but there is more opportunity

2698120 my friend mike brought his pet mouse to school today and while the teacher was writing the spelling words on the blackboard he was playing with it then it got away
2698121 it ran across the room and over to the teacher then it ran right up her leg she began to scream and reached down and grabbed hold of that poor little mouse and began to squeeze
2698122 dad its a miracle the amount of water she squeezed out of that poor little mouse

2698124 ive been looking a little deeper at your numerology chart lynne and here is what i have found i see you floating in a sea of endless time great vistas and a feeling of lifetimes behind and ahead of you i get the feeling of urgency with you lynne things that must be done lessons that must be experienced i sense the rhythm of life the cycles we all experience from your life path in combination with your soul urge i get the impression that you have a pleasant personality and are generally liked by others you can be easily hurt at times and as a result are more careful with displaying your feelings than you used to be lynne i sense that you are a very busy person who is always on the go the more you have on your plate the better at times you wish you had less to do but you would be totally lost if you woke up one morning and found nothing at all to do this couldnt happen of course as every time you get a space you seem to fill it up very quickly youll be just as busy in late life as well in fact you wont get time to grow old youll just simply keep on growing having said that its not surprising you need a break after this past year lets face it we all need a little breathing space now and again to re charge our batteries remember to take time to smell the roses lynne you have had a few worries recently about money but you know you have the power to solve them while its been a bit of a bumpy ride financially these past couple of years the next 18 months or so will be a lot easier looking at your personal days and personal months you should be pleased lynne it shows that shortly you will receive some pleasant news it is nothing momentous but is sufficient to raise your sights and hopes it is good news i sense a period early on in your life teenage years perhaps when you felt misunderstood as if you couldnt really get close to anyone as it you are walking on the outside of life these feelings very occasionally reoccur you are a very special person lynne the experiences you undergo are all for a very special purpose one im sure you are not aware of yet nevertheless you are progressing in exactly the right direction your timing is good and you are learning from every experience i dont know if you believe in reincarnation but i get the feeling that you are a highly evolved person as if you have lived many times before in time you will have much to offer the rest of us romantically it has not always been easy and your outlook on life has changed because of this the future is much easier in this regard than in the past lynne you have sometimes wondered if you have made the right decisions at times and it looks as if you have you work best when you make your own mind up on things though it is useful to ask other people for advice before you make your own mind up i see some travel in your future and several new horizons beckoning your progress in this world has not always been as fast as you would like but i can see significant growth in the future you tend to feel you have a lot of unused capacity and that people dont always give you full credit for your abilities i can see you happy and productive in your old age surrounded by friends and family you are of above average intelligence and will keep on learning all the way through life

2698203 a lot of my friends are sardarjis im very fond of them for their lifestyle and daring ive never done a film that would hurt any communitys feelings quite frequently i get rid of potentially funny scenes when i feel theyre offensive i want to distribute love not hatred through my cinema
2698204 our intentions cannot be doubted people who saw the film on wednesday say singh is kinng is better than my no entry and welcome my wife thinks this is my best work to date and my children love it thats a relief if people in my home dont like a film how can i expect people outside to like it
2698205 ill say only one thing ive made a very good film its a much bigger film than my no entry and welcome but i wasnt thinking of those films while making singh is kinng i didnt want to repeat the earlier formula for the first time ive incorporated action scenes in my cinema i dont like action but because of akshay we had to include it
2698206 i go before the release of all my films and spend four five days in ajmer sharif im able to overcome my nervousness there
2698207 i dont make four films a year i make one film every two years so ive no immediate project to fall back on ive put my entire life in singh is kinng
2698208 vipul loves and respects me thats why he approached me id love to do another film with him if vipul didnt have confidence in me why would he let me direct hed have done it himself
2698209 i normally shoot one film at a time its because of my producer vipuls planning that i could complete and release singh is kinng eight months after my last release welcome

2698217 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2698218 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2698219 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2698220 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2698221 all peaceful avenues have been exhausted to resolve the conflict

2698227 last friday august 8 the lady met with her lawyer u kyi win from 1 00 pm to 3 00 pm regarding her detention
2698228 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2698229 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2698230 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries

2698257 statistics are not per se more accurate or representative than personal perceptions
2698258 your argument is consistent with saying that if a newspaper runs a headline saying that brown is popular then we should question the statistics that say he isnt just as much as we question the newspaper

2698286 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2698287 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2698288 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2698289 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2698290 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2698291 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2698292 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2698293 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2698294 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2698295 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2698296 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2698297 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2698298 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2698299 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2698300 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2698301 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2698302 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2698303 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2698304 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2698305 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2698306 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2698307 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2698308 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2698309 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2698310 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2698311 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2698312 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2698313 just so you all know we did set a record
2698314 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2698315 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2698316 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2698317 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2698318 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2698319 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2698320 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2698321 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2698322 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2698323 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2698324 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2698325 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2698326 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2698327 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2698328 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2698329 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2698330 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2698331 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2698332 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2698333 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2698334 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2698335 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2698336 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2698337 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2698338 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2698339 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2698340 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2698341 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2698342 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2698343 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2698344 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2698345 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2698346 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2698347 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2698348 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2698349 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2698350 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2698351 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2698352 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2698353 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2698354 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2698355 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2698356 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2698357 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2698358 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2698359 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2698360 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2698361 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2698362 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2698363 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2698364 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2698365 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2698366 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2698367 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2698368 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2698369 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2698370 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2698371 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2698372 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2698373 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2698374 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2698375 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2698376 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2698377 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2698378 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2698379 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2698380 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2698381 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2698382 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2698383 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2698384 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2698385 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2698386 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2698387 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2698388 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2698389 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2698390 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2698391 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2698392 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2698393 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2698394 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2698395 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2698396 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2698397 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2698398 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2698399 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2698400 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2698401 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2698402 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2698403 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2698404 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2698405 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2698406 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2698407 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2698408 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2698409 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2698410 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2698411 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2698412 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2698413 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2698414 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2698415 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2698416 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2698417 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2698418 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2698419 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2698420 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2698421 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2698422 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2698423 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2698424 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2698425 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2698426 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2698427 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2698428 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2698429 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2698430 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2698431 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2698432 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2698433 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2698434 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2698435 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2698436 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2698437 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2698438 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2698439 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2698440 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2698441 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2698442 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2698443 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2698444 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2698445 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2698446 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2698447 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2698448 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2698449 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2698450 autoon ei tullut suurempia vaurioita sellaiset havainnot kuitenkin on ett ei palo ainakaan vahinko ole
2698451 iso osa niist on sellaisia vaivattomia paloja joissa auto syttyy ajon aikana palamaan
2698452 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2698453 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2698454 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2698455 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2698456 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2698457 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2698458 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2698459 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2698460 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2698461 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2698462 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2698463 need k ed n evad v lja nagu sinu omad
2698464 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2698465 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2698466 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2698467 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2698468 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2698469 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2698470 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2698471 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2698472 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2698473 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2698474 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2698475 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2698476 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2698477 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2698478 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2698479 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2698480 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2698481 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2698482 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2698483 well as someone with a liberal bias dunsmore would say that wouldnt he
2698484 i have just become the symbol of the possibility of america returning to its best traditions
2698485 it has become increasingly clear in my travel that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2698486 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2698487 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2698488 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2698489 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2698490 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2698491 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2698492 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2698493 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2698494 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2698495 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2698496 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2698497 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2698498 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2698499 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2698500 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2698501 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2698502 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2698503 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2698504 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2698505 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2698506 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2698507 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2698508 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2698509 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2698510 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2698511 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2698512 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2698513 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2698514 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2698515 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2698516 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2698517 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2698518 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2698519 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2698520 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2698521 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2698522 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2698523 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2698524 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2698525 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2698526 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2698527 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2698528 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2698529 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2698530 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2698531 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2698532 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2698533 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2698534 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2698535 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2698536 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2698537 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2698538 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2698539 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2698540 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2698541 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2698542 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2698543 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2698544 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2698545 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2698546 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2698547 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2698548 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2698549 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2698550 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2698551 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2698552 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2698553 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2698554 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2698555 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2698556 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2698557 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2698558 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2698559 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2698560 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2698561 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2698562 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2698563 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2698564 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2698565 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2698566 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2698567 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2698568 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2698569 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2698570 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2698571 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2698572 considering the circumstances the best thing the palestinians could do is accept their fate and negotiate an agreement leading to the creation of a sovereign nation encompassing th gaza strip and west bank
2698573 why should any citizens be carrying guns and why one group but not the other are the arabs more of a threat to the jews than the jews are to the arabs
2698574 the real point as noticed here by one of americas most prominent one man bloggers is that the brits are actually leading the way in pointing out to the world that american faults are generally over reported and american strengths under reported
2698575 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the

2698582 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2698583 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2698584 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2698585 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2698586 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2698587 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2698588 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2698589 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2698590 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2698591 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2698592 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2698593 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2698594 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2698595 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2698596 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2698597 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2698598 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2698599 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2698600 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up

2698614 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2698615 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2698616 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years

2698618 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2698619 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital

2698723 none of these objects made any sounds the only sound we heard was when a military jet flew over us and headed towards the objects the objects disappeared and never returned after a short chase by the military jet as we were driving home my sons mom called him to see if we had seen the strange lights in the sky she lives in rochester indiana which is about 40 miles from where we were at she said she was on the lake on her boat and noticed the lights darting around and flaring up
2698724 it happened thursday july 24th 2008 i live in peru indiana my wife and a few people were sitting outside last night around 10 30 pm
2698725 i heard a lot of noise that sounded like jet engines they were really low i stopped at a gas station to take a look and seen jets everywhere it was between nine and ten at night and they were chasing this big bright light that glowed red and yellow i guess all this was happening miles away from me in the sky but it looked closer i was at a gas station and everyone was looking at all this when i went inside the cashier said that he thought it was a ufo and everyone in there said the same thing i stopped somewhere between brookston and monticello
2698726 i heard you on coast to coast and wanted to report a bright light i seen near main street and 31 on the 24th 7 24 08 in rochester the light looked like a spotlight they use for store openings and i saw jets around it at 11pm my kid was with me and he got scared i called my wife and asked if she seen it we live near fulton avenue across town and she said the light was high in the sky above our house she didnt see the jets but heard them

2698737 i just love to run since the time i was really little i always loved to run one day my mom came home with a flyer about hershey track and field she asked me if i wanted to do it and of course i wanted to do it
2698738 they really talked positive about their athletes and how to keep on going if you really want it you have to go for it you have to work hard for it
2698739 i met this one friend her name is nikki and she is just really nice

2698772 we also have rooms on the ground floor with parking directly outside which would be much less walking
2698773 sir there is no parking near the elevators and it would be farther for her to walk to the elevator
2698774 yes sir i understand but we have rooms on the ground floor with parking directly outside it would be much closer than if you had to park and then take the elevator

2698793 cicero mentioned that the flesh of oysters waxed and waned with
2698794 about the aurora borealis and the relation of a prisms
2698795 the war however is not constant but recurrent in a slight degree at short periods and more severely at occasional more distant periods
2698796 as in every climate there are seasons for each of its inhabitants of greater and less abundance so all annually breed
2698797 many practical illustrations of this rapid tendency to increase are on record among which during peculiar seasons are the extraordinary numbers of certain animals
2698798 now i think it cannot be doubted that during the breeding season all the mice ordinarily pair
2698799 yet we have every reason to believe from what is known of wild animals that all would pair in the spring
2698800 it should always be remembered that in most cases the checks are recurrent yearly in a small regular degree
2698801 average number of individuals is kept up by recurrent struggles against other species or against external nature
2698802 those individuals being better adapted would be slightly favoured and would tend to live longer and to survive during that time of year when the food was scarcest
2698803 the struggle of males for the females the struggle falls moreover at a time of year when food is generally abundant and perhaps the effect chiefly produced would be the modification of the secondary sexual characters
2698804 man is subject like other mammals birds and even insects to that mysterious law which causes certain normal processes such as gestation as well as the maturation and duration of various diseases to follow lunar periods
2698805 as famines are periodical depending chiefly on extreme seasons all tribes must fluctuate in number hence the progenitors of man would have tended to increase rapidly but checks of some kind either periodical or constant must have kept down their numbers even more severely than with existing savages no doubt in this case and in all others many checks concur and different checks under different circumstances periodical dearths depending on unfavourable seasons being probably the most important of all so it will have been with the early progenitors of man
2698806 animals can certainly by some means judge of the intervals of time between recurrent events
2698807 but the most curious instance known to me of one instinct getting the better of another is the migratory instinct conquering the maternal instinct the former is wonderfully strong a confined bird will at the proper season beat her breast against the wires of her cage until it is bare and bloody it causes young salmon to leap out of the fresh water in which they could continue to exist and thus unintentionally to commit suicide every one knows how strong the maternal instinct is leading even timid birds to face great danger though with hesitation and in opposition to the instinct of self preservation nevertheless the migratory instinct is so powerful that late in the autumn swallows house martins and swifts frequently desert their tender young leaving them to perish miserably in their nests
2698808 we can perceive that an instinctive impulse if it be in any way more beneficial to a species than some other or opposed instinct would be rendered the more potent of the two through natural selection for the individuals which had it most strongly developed would survive in larger numbers whether this is the case with the migratory in comparison with the maternal instinct may be doubted the great persistence or steady action of the former at certain seasons of the year during the whole day may give it for a time paramount force
2698809 the inhabitants of the seashore must be greatly affected by the tides animals living either about the mean high water mark or about the mean low water mark pass through a complete cycle of tidal changes in a fortnight consequently their food supply will undergo marked changes week by week the vital functions of such animals living under these conditions for many generations can hardly fail to run their course in regular weekly periods now it is a mysterious fact that in the higher and now terrestrial vertebrata as well as in other classes many normal and abnormal processes one or more whole weeks as their periods this would be rendered intelligible if the vertebrata are descended from an animal allied to the existing tidal ascidians many instances of such periodic processes might be given as the gestation of mammals the duration of fevers amp c the hatching of eggs affords also a good example for according to mr bartlett land and water jan 7 1871 the eggs of the pigeon are hatched in two weeks those of the fowl in three those of the duck in four those of the goose in five and those of the ostrich in seven weeks as far as we can judge a recurrent period if approximately of the right duration for any process or function would not when once gained be liable to change consequently it might be thus transmitted through almost any number of generations but if the function changed the period would have to change and would be apt to change almost abruptly by a whole week this conclusion if sound is highly remarkable for the period of gestation in each mammal and the hatching of each birds eggs and many other vital processes thus betray to us the primordial birthplace of these animals
2698810 the cause of this difference between the males and females in their periods of arrival and maturity is sufficiently obvious those males which annually first migrated into any country or which in the spring were first ready to breed or were the most eager would leave the largest number of offspring and these would tend to inherit similar instincts and constitutions it must be borne in mind that it would have been impossible to change very materially the time of sexual maturity in the females without at the same time interfering with the period of the production of the young a period which must be determined by the seasons of the year on the whole there can be no doubt that with almost all animals in which the sexes are separate there is a constantly recurrent struggle between the males for the possession of the females
2698811 with animals in a state of nature innumerable instances occur of characters appearing periodically at different seasons we see this in the horns of the stag and in the fur of arctic animals which becomes thick and white during the winter many birds acquire bright colours and other decorations during the breeding season alone pallas states that in siberia domestic cattle and horses become lighter coloured during the winter and i have myself observed and heard of similar strongly marked changes of colour that is from brownish cream colour or reddish brown to a perfect white in several ponies in england although i do not know that this tendency to change the colour of the coat during different seasons is transmitted yet it probably is so as all shades of colour are strongly inherited by the horse nor is this form of inheritance as limited by the seasons more remarkable than its limitation by age or sex
2698812 from the foregoing discussion on the various laws of inheritance we learn that the characters of the parents often or even generally tend to become developed in the offspring of the same sex at the same age and periodically at the same season of the year in which they first appeared in the parents
2698813 the coloured plumage and certain other ornaments of the adult males are either retained for life or are periodically renewed during the summer and breeding season at this same season the beak and naked skin about the head frequently change colour as with some herons ibises gulls one of the bell birds just noticed amp c in the white ibis the cheeks the inflatable skin of the throat and the basal portion of the beak then become crimson in one of the rails gallicrex cristatus a large red caruncle is developed during this period on the head of the male so it is with a thin horny crest on the beak of one of the pelicans p erythrorhynchus for after the breeding season these horny crests are shed like horns from the heads of stags and the shore of an island in a lake in nevada was found covered with these curious exuviae
2698814 changes of colour in the plumage according to the season depend firstly on a double annual moult secondly on an actual change of colour in the feathers themselves and thirdly on their dull coloured margins being periodically shed or on these three processes more or less combined the shedding of the deciduary margins may be compared with the shedding of their down by very young birds for the down in most cases arises from the summits of the first true feathers
2698815 with respect to the birds which annually undergo a double moult there are firstly some kinds for instance snipes swallow plovers glareolae and curlews in which the two sexes resemble each other and do not change colour at any season i do not know whether the winter plumage is thicker and warmer than the summer plumage but warmth seems the most probable end attained of a double moult where there is no change of colour secondly there are birds for instance certain species of totanus and other grallatores the sexes of which resemble each other but in which the summer and winter plumage differ slightly in colour the difference however in these cases is so small that it can hardly be an advantage to them and it may perhaps be attributed to the direct action of the different conditions to which the birds are exposed during the two seasons thirdly there are many other birds the sexes of which are alike but which are widely different in their summer and winter plumage fourthly there are birds the sexes of which differ from each other in colour but the females though moulting twice retain the same colours throughout the year whilst the males undergo a change of colour sometimes a great one as with certain bustards fifthly and lastly there are birds the sexes of which differ from each other each other in both their summer and winter plumage but the male undergoes a greater amount of change at each recurrent season than the female of which the ruff machetes pugnax offers a good instance with respect to the cause or purpose of the differences in colour between the summer and winter plumage this may in some instances as with the ptarmigan serve during both seasons as a protection when the difference between the two plumages is slight it may perhaps be attributed as already remarked to the direct action of the conditions of life but with many birds there can hardly be a doubt that the summer plumage is ornamental even when both sexes are alike we may conclude that this is the case with many herons egrets amp c for they acquire their beautiful plumes only during the breeding season moreover such plumes top knots amp c though possessed by both sexes are occasionally a little more developed in the male than in the female and they resemble the plumes and ornaments possessed by the males alone of other birds it is also known that confinement by affecting the reproductive system of male birds frequently checks the development of their secondary sexual characters but has no immediate influence on any other characters and i am informed by mr bartlett that eight or nine specimens of the knot tringa canutus retained their unadorned winter plumage in the zoological gardens throughout the year from which fact we may infer that the summer plumage though common to both sexes partakes of the nature of the exclusively masculine plumage of many other birds
2698816 from the foregoing facts more especially from neither sex of certain birds changing colour during either annual moult or changing so slightly that the change can hardly be of any service to them and from the females of other species moulting twice yet retaining the same colours throughout the year we may conclude that the habit of annually moulting twice has not been acquired in order that the male should assume an ornamental character during the breeding season but that the double moult having been originally acquired for some distinct purpose has subsequently been taken advantage of in certain cases for gaining a nuptial plumage
2698817 a few words must be added on changes of plumage in relation to the season of the year from reasons formerly assigned there can be little doubt that the elegant plumes long pendant feathers crests amp c of egrets herons and many other birds which are developed and retained only during the summer serve for ornamental and nuptial purposes though common to both sexes the female is thus rendered more conspicuous during the period of incubation than during the winter but such birds as herons and egrets would be able to defend themselves as however plumes would probably be inconvenient and certainly of no use during the winter it is possible that the habit of moulting twice in the year may have been gradually acquired through natural selection for the sake of casting off inconvenient ornaments during the winter but this view cannot be extended to the many waders whose summer and winter plumages differ very little in colour with defenceless species in which both sexes or the males alone become extremely conspicuous during the breeding season or when the males acquire at this season such long wing or tail feathers as to impede their flight as with cosmetornis and vidua it certainly at first appears highly probable that the second moult has been gained for the special purpose of throwing off these ornaments we must however remember that many birds such as some of the birds of paradise the argus pheasant and peacock do not cast their plumes during the winter and it can hardly be maintained that the constitution of these birds at least of the gallinaceae renders a double moult impossible for the ptarmigan moults thrice in the year
2698818 hence it must be considered as doubtful whether the many species which moult their ornamental plumes or lose their bright colours during the winter have acquired this habit on account of the inconvenience or danger which they would otherwise have suffered
2698819 precise timing of surges in sex specific steroid hormones during embryonic development primes various tissues to respond differently in males and females to photoperiodically induced surges of same hormones at the precise time of the breeding season of a mature adult animal resulting in sex specific changes in morphology physiology and behavior

2698835 the president invited prime minister rudd to address the 2nd global forum on migration and development of course we are going to have also our philippine australian ministerial meeting in october and they both agreed that this would be a good time for pm rudd to visit the philippines
2698836 so it will be an opportune time for australia to be in the 2nd global forum in as much as this meeting concerns both the sending and receiving countries
2698837 great help to our many projects including those in southern mindanao

2698839 wir haben biss gezeigt aber niemand muss angst haben dass wir aufgrund eines 3 1 erfolgs in essen die arbeit einstellen
2698840 wir sind auf eine k mpferisch starke mannschaft getroffen die sofort zur ckkam nach dem gegentor die euphorie mitnahm und uns das hat sp ren lassen bis zur halbzeit

2698843 mir geht es darum das gef ge st rker zu machen es ist und bleibt keine einzelsportart da muss ein rad ins andere greifen
2698844 wir haben uns im spiel nach vorne ein wenig verunsichern lassen und mussten schon fr h mit langen b llen agieren weil die essener die r ume zugestellt hatten
2698845 in der hitzigen atmosph re war das gar nicht so leicht in der zweiten halbzeit haben wir aber ganz ordentlich gespielt
2698846 in der ersten halbzeit haben wir uns generell schwer getan
2698847 ich habe einige jungs gesehen die einen gro en schritt nach vorne gemacht haben

2698858 cant quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment instead he commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2698859 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
2698860 whats missing is the judgment to be commander in chief
2698861 but i will say that every increase in funding must be matched by increases in accountability both at the va and in congress
2698862 i have had the good fortune to know personally a great many brave and selfless patriots who sacrificed and shed blood to defend america but i have known none braver or better than those who do so today they are our inspiration as i suspect all of you were once theirs and i pray to a loving god that he bless and protect them
2698863 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
2698864 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush
2698865 he should have been talking about veterans issues not his opponent
2698866 in my judgment this is the most modest university presidents office i have seen
2698867 i chose the current desk because it was the most attractive
2698868 his on the ground organization looks real good mccains is very quiet up here if im a republican strategist it would scare me
2698869 it wont be as small a victory as people say
2698870 hes forced to spend an incredible amount of resources here because he needs to prove or try to prove to nevadans that his record is moderate when in fact its not
2698871 hes the got the most liberal voting record in the u s senate
2698872 if youre mccain i dont think you can completely sit back and rely on a media campaign
2698873 theyre looking at ohio pennsylvania michigan electoral rich states and think if they can win two of those they can win the election
2698874 i dont want to take money out of your pocket
2698875 says no to nuclear storage and no to nuclear processing i could not disagree more
2698876 he came back to me and said look thats not my style i believe in telling it like it is and i dont believe in making any kind of false threat to do something that im not willing to do even if its politically expedient im not going to take that route and thats just not my style
2698877 what youre going to get from him is when he tells you something he means it theres no hidden agenda and its about transparency he wants to talk about the real problem he doesnt want to play politics
2698878 theres not much more that needs to be said there because hes very visible and effective
2698879 it seems like rogers is doing most of the work for higher education
2698880 itd be nice if ashley could take more of a leadership role
2698881 i dont see him i dont hear from him i dont get e mails from him
2698882 im not criticizing his leadership hes probably behind the scenes and as far as i know doing a good job
2698883 its just you dont know who he is you might not be able to pick him out of a crowd
2698884 it wouldnt be a bad idea to put some shoe leather on those sidewalks when it comes to opening up the semester
2698885 walk around talk to people look for opportunities to speak send e mails out
2698886 want to know that somebody is minding the store and doing the best to try to help the institution survive
2698887 we have lots of different events on campus and i basically come to every one when im available and i enjoy doing that i want to do that i want to be part of all different aspects of the university
2698888 i want decisions to be driven by data and consultation i really have tried to open up new avenues of discussion and consultation
2698889 i think that she over the tenure of her presidency she made a lot of good solid friends for the university that had and still have a high regard for her and fundraising is personal it comes as a result of personal relationships and i think she has some relationships that could help us raise funds
2698890 i dont think theres a right or wrong to it so i would be very reluctant to say david you should use carol or you shouldnt
2698891 its good because its not something that hes natural at

2698897 he said hey this first match in the olympic games is what were gearing up for
2698898 obviously we wish he could be here even though we understand why hes not
2698899 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think we should be doing and having him say i dont think so rather than where i am right now
2698900 he doesnt know if or when hell be able to return to the team

2698906 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2698907 there are positives and negatives to every girl in the world you have to see where the break even point is and measure your relationship from there
2698908 one 77 fuses advanced technology with stunning aston martin design to create possibly the worlds most desirable automotive art form based on a sophisticated carbon fibre chassis with a handcrafted aluminium body this 7 0 litre v12 super car will deliver exhilarating performance for a strictly limited number of discerning customers
2698909 a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents
2698910 getting critical messages through quickly and accurately is a must for road safety
2698911 we should also keep in mind that with 24 of europeans driving time spent in traffic jams the costs caused by congestion could reach 80 billion by 2010 so clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money

2698913 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2698914 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2698915 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2698916 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2698917 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2698918 the northern territory election is reminder to all of us in politics that the australian people will hold us accountable
2698919 this is an important lesson for all sides of politics particularly those of us who are currently in government
2698920 its raised expectations that it wont deliver on its failed to live up to those expectations and they will be punished
2698921 its always very dangerous to try and extrapolate state results onto federal results
2698922 ich wollte einfach nur rausgehen und spa haben und den haben wir gehabt
2698923 die freude von ditte war ansteckend da ist der funke dann bergesprungen
2698924 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2698925 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2698926 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2698927 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2698928 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2698929 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2698930 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2698931 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2698932 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2698933 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2698934 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2698935 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2698936 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2698937 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2698938 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2698939 i spoke with kaka yesterday saturday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2698940 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2698941 he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2698942 normally milan do not sell their best players we think they like the proposal but it is not so easy for them to accept it
2698943 no sooner disown his reverend as he could his white grandmother
2698944 everytime i play ponsana is hard i didnt get my strategy right and was very cautious in the first two games
2698945 ahmadinejad dan attaturk memang dua tokoh yang antagonis karena attaturk adalah sekutu dekat muhammad ridho pahlevi yang ditumbangkan oleh revolusi islam pimpinan imam khomaeni tahun 1979 sementara imam khomaeni adalah idola dan inspirator bagi ahmadinejad
2698946 iran adalah negara yang sangat penting dan menjadi agenda pembicaraan seluruh negara negara dunia memperdebatkan masalah penolakan ahmadinejad berkunjung ke makam kamal attaturk saya kira tidak lebih penting dibanding agenda pembicaraan

2699044 unlike the advertisements at least we dont put naked women in out graphics
2699045 couldnt a gaudy graphic also perpetuate the perception that an information architect is a mere data decorator
2699046 i think also future designers have to be proficient to some degree with some programming
2699047 dont replicate one in the other why replicate paper on computers when computers have nothing to do with paper
2699048 now if you want to present a fact that moves people to some action then you have to shape the information in a way that it will in fact affect them upset them excite them and move them to some kind of action
2699049 this is a growing concern of mine as i feel far behind on most software learning curves and most of all on employers requirement of advanced knowledge of various
2699050 designers seldom code if you are attached to programming all power to you the world needs more design sensitive programmers but unless you have complete control over your projects you will be short changing your users by trying to design and develop at the same a conflict of interest so if you cant stomach the thought of abandoning programming interaction design may not be for you
2699051 this is a growing concern of mine as i feel far behind on most software learning curves and most of all on employers requirement of advanced knowledge of various

2699060 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2699061 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me
2699062 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2699063 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2699064 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2699065 we had a deal i told bob that i wanted this to be my last 400 im he said i have to end on a record
2699066 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2699067 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2699068 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2699069 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2699070 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2699071 i sort of turned around and thought i saw 4 31 and i was thinking that hurt a lot for a 4 31
2699072 but when i walked over and saw the 4 29 i thought thats amazing
2699073 it was a tough race but i cant really be mad
2699074 i was only like a half second off my best time so im happy to get my first medal of the olympics
2699075 everyone did a great job and were really happy with silver because i dont think we were even expecting that
2699076 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2699077 maybe thats why it hurts so much it hit so close

2699107 recently we have seen evidence of a concerted effort to pressure the iraqi government into privatizing iraqi oil fields against the will of its citizens we have also heard that certain high level architects of the iraq war stand to gain financially this bill will ensure that the iraqi oil money stays out of the hands of u s oil companies who would otherwise benefit from the us attack on and occupation of iraq
2699108 in iraq subject to the security situation we are keen to make progress
2699109 i believe we have a moral responsibility to deal with this and to deal with it by any means that we can
2699110 the f b i is committed to protecting the news media consistent with the first amendment and department of justice policies and we very much regret that this situation occurred
2699111 i want to find more about what this is about
2699112 we will be asking our general counsel to advise us on what more we should be doing about this
2699113 i told the director that it was gracious of him to apologize of course wed still like to know more about how this happened and how the bureau is securing against similar violations in the future
2699114 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2699115 tactical battalions have completely liberated tskhinvali from georgian military forces
2699116 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2699117 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2699118 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2699119 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2699120 there were parts of this legislation that just got passed that a number of us found objectionable unnecessary extraneous too much government involvement
2699121 but i found it a simple decision to do so because there was no other good alternative
2699122 paulson and his colleagues philosophically are free market people but when things go wrong you just dont have a lot of choice
2699123 there has been a change in perception that the government needs to play a more active role when we get into a financial crisis the question is to what degree do you say we wont do this again
2699124 we told him we think we need to have an intervention
2699125 hospitals are either eating the cost or passing it along to insurers so you and i are paying it in increased premiums
2699126 some companies seem to figure no one is watching so they can get away with it
2699127 this allows ceos to walk in the door and drop 70 100
2699128 just in his tax policies alone mccain is saving corporate america 175 billion a year
2699129 theyre doing the public offering now so that the compensation can be taxed at the lower rate while bush is still in office
2699130 theyre betting obama is going to win and theyre getting their money while they can
2699131 i think we dont want to make too much of his promises on taxes
2699132 once the republicans are vanquished i wouldnt hold your breath waiting for that capital gains tax hike
2699133 in financial terms they were playing blackjack at tables where they themselves were the dealers in casinos they themselves owned
2699134 more people are involved and i think that necessarily dilutes the impact of any individual which is probably a good thing
2699135 the message is that hes going to be a friend to wall street just as bill clinton was a friend to wall street
2699136 wall street will want to be at the head of the table

2699232 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2699233 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering

2699235 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2699236 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2699237 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country

2699283 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic sea ice
2699284 the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years

2699304 sienna is being portrayed as a femme fatale and fears for her career because hollywood hates a home wrecker she hopes balthazar can get rosetta to put out a statement saying their marriage was already over

2699344 me apena decirlo pero cuanto m s cultural es un viaje menos hombres se apuntan un 80 85 de los que viajan con nosotros son mujeres siendo un sector el del single en el que hay los mismos hombres que mujeres
2699345 y es m s f cil conseguir sexo que comunicaci n
2699346 la mujer es mucho m s activa m s social necesita actividad y conocer gente al hombre le basta con tomar una copa con un amigo o quedarse en casa viendo la tele
2699347 la base del negocio es que las mujeres casadas se mueren de asco en casa

2699350 die mir als kind fr h liebgeworden und immer geblieben ist
2699351 ich mag die liturgie lieder und kluge predigten die r ume die gelegenheit zur meditation
2699352 aber warum l t gott wenn er uns vergeben will seinen sohn ans kreuz schlagen warum vergibt er uns nicht einfach
2699353 ich erlebe sie als eine gemeinschaft von menschen die guten willens sind
2699354 das ist viel und es langt um mitglied der evangelischen kirche zu bleiben
2699355 ich glaube nach dem tod kommt nichts mehr und das ist auch recht so

2699358 just sitting there watching this morning watching michael phelps set a world record it was something that was special to me because it made me realise how many people are inspired by him and that im now in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country
2699359 today was a little different this is even different than a davis cup davis cup is thrilling exciting definitely a little nervous but out here was crazy
2699360 its about as humid as ive ever played in and i live in florida
2699361 upon receiving the recommendations of the iocs disciplinary commission the executive board has declared miss thanou ineligible to participate in the 2008 beijing olympic games
2699362 to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration that this case has brought the olympic movement very much into disrepute
2699363 this is an ioc ruling based on its olympic charter
2699364 there was a whole string of events that took place in this sorry tale they really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga
2699365 anytime you think you can get close to michael phelps he jumps another level
2699366 that was the difference in the race which its kind of gratifying to see that happen after many years of trying to make it happen he paced it really well he didnt use too much energy on the butterfly he did the backstroke at the right effort level and then when he knew he was going to have to really put it into the breaststroke he did
2699367 it hit me today that that was his best race
2699368 i said to bob i wanted to sing on the medal podium but i just couldnt stop crying
2699369 everything that happened this year the ups and downs weve had this year and ryan is coming on like a freight train i was just happy to get the first one under my belt thinking about all that just made me start getting more and more emotional
2699370 he was shaking and tearing up at the same time
2699371 i was like well you just got a gold medal at the olympics
2699372 coming into the last 25 to 50 meters of the race in athens i saw myself out there alone and i just sort of smiled
2699373 its an honour to be leading ive been training really hard for this
2699374 but were only four races into this this is a very long event were not even halfway through ill take it one day and one race at a time and just keep on moving
2699375 he had a fantastic opportunity to protest me and probably get me disqualified so i had to take a penalty turn which cost me distance
2699376 its the olympics and you try and you do anything you can to get an advantage on your opponent and most of the fleet try and give me a hard time when they can
2699377 hes sailing really well hes been in the class for three years and continually improving we will have to see if we can give him a hard time in the next couple of days
2699378 he was a lovely man but i was very young
2699379 i didnt know who i was and i was still struggling as an actor i was a terrible wife
2699380 bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2699381 hij werkte bij de politie voordat wij elkaar leerden kennen
2699382 de overwaarde ging in depot om de schadevergoeding aan de slachtoffers te kunnen betalen
2699383 ik heb hem vergeven mede omdat mijn katholieke geloof scheiden niet mogelijk maakte
2699384 ik dacht dat hij nu wel zijn lesje geleerd had en niet meer de fout in zou gaan
2699385 daar zijn we weggepest door mensen van vitesse jack zat vroeger bij de arnhemse fanclub
2699386 die jongen gaat alleen maar in hoger beroep omdat hij geld geroken heeft die wil een schadevergoeding
2699387 dertien jaar geleden verloren we ons eerste kind ik ben er nog steeds kapot van toen onze dochter acht jaar geleden werd geboren hing ook haar leven na zes weken aan een zijden draadje we zijn door een hel gegaan
2699388 mia je moet kiezen hij eruit of jullie allemaal weg uit de buurt
2699389 ik wil hier blijven wonen maar als hij vrijkomt moet hij ergens wonen dan zal ik zorgen dat hij een huis heeft ik kan hem niet aan zijn lot overlaten
2699390 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2699391 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2699392 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2699393 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2699394 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2699395 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2699396 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2699397 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2699398 weve a few injury niggles at the back and i am looking for some experienced cover
2699399 ben is steady but he has a couple of clubs interested in him and i will have to have a think about it
2699400 over the summer i have had one or two players come back from long term injury but have had another two go out
2699401 ellos jugaron muy bien y nosotros no nos encontramos pero al promediar el segundo set nos recuperamos bela jug un partido excelente y el bebe comenz a sentir el cansancio y ah estuvo la clave del partido
2699402 en el 0 2 del segundo set nos pusimos muy mal nos peleamos a muerte con bela pero eso es lo bueno que tenemos que a los dos segundos estamos de vuelta tirando para el mismo lado y as sacamos el partido bela sigui machacando al bebe y ellos lo sintieron mucho
2699403 ser m s complicada de lo que generalmente es porque llegamos muy cansados yo ya sent hoy el desgaste de dos partidos a tres sets as que esperamos que se defina r pido a favor nuestro claro risas
2699404 fue un partido que jugamos muy bien al comienzo y luego nos mat el cansancio
2699405 en el primer set se notaba que bela estaba tocado y no pod a jugar tan c modo lo cual hac a que juan se apresurara mucho y fallara nosotros est bamos firmes y con el quiebre al inicio del segundo pensamos que pod amos pero contra ellos nunca se sabe ya vimos ayer lo que hicieron contra lima y jardim
2699406 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2699407 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2699408 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2699409 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2699410 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2699411 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2699412 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2699413 the party also took part in shilpa shetty bears the same the same as akshay and the shows competitors
2699414 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2699420 on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2699421 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player
2699422 the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2699423 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2699424 he is english and can play three different positions but i am talking about someone who can play on the left
2699425 the way he drew kilicci towards him on the ropes then moved either side before scoring and going out of range again was fantastic
2699426 he showed so much maturity and believe me theres better to come from him

2699491 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2699492 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives

2699579 while the issues are serious i dont think theyre going to bring down any one country
2699580 there is increasing demand for the worlds limited resources of energy particularly oil food and what i think will be a critical issue in the future water
2699581 i think the failure of the doha round of negotiations is a tragedy for the world because if it had succeeded it would have generated additional wealth to the world that could have been reportedly the size of the current chinese economy
2699582 we hope that there will be new technologies being developed and there will be renewable options other than wind because at moment the only technology is wind
2699583 but we think if there is a bridging period of that 10 years which we think gas can do the work then gas will still be important but it wont carry all the load

2699594 today billions of connected people around the world can cooperate to make just about anything that requires human creativity a computer and an internet connection unlike before where the costs of production were high people can collaborate and share their creations at very little cost this means that individuals neednt rely on markets or capital intensive firms to make or trade all of the goods and services they desire a growing proportion to the things we value newspapers included can now be produced by us or in cooperation with the people we interact with socially simply because we want to
2699595 this sounds like a potential threat to business but its an opportunity for firms to learn how to harness this creative potential in their businesses
2699596 we are at a tipping point in the economy where recession is probable so ceos and top managers need to quickly shift their strategies for 2008 the ceos who will be tossed out by their boards in a year or two will be the ones who simply focus on cutting costs over the next twelve months allowing competitors to smack their companies hard with new products and services as the economy begins to grow strongly again in 2009 smart managers will focus on innovation during the tough months ahead and come out swinging by the end of the year this is what apple tends to do so look to apple not for its products but for its strategy

2699599 they must be let alone left to themselves a great deal to take in what they can of the beauty of earth and heavens for of the evils of modern education few are worse than this that the perpetual cackle of his elders leaves the poor child not a moment of time nor an inch of space wherein to wonder and grow there is much to be got by perching in a tree or nestling in heather but muscular development comes of more active ways and an hour or two should be spent in vigorous play
2699600 i think my favorite memories of playing as a kid or at least the thing that was most constant about playing as a kid was the woods behind our house in massachusetts not so much just as woods per se but in that they became a landscape for me where i told stories and had adventures sometimes in the actual places to scale but more often taking the relatively small woods and expanding them in size into a world as a whole with countries and histories and wars that i would tell to myself never to anyone else and almost never written down so i dont remember most of it rivers were oceans rises in the land mountain ranges the strip of un forested land underneath the power lines a vast savanna and the little rocky outcroppings in the middle of the green river great island nations these places got named and re named over and over again i think mostly based on whatever i was reading at the time if it was the redwall books it was one thing if it was lord of the rings it was something else if it was star wars it was something else but i do remember that there were a few very involved story lines that went on for a long time years in fact and that id go back to over and over again bits and pieces of these stories i used to tell to myself while i walked around in the woods ended up in stories that i wrote down but most of its just gone now and i cant really remember specifics and then of course there was much more concrete playing out in the woods climbing trees swimming in the river i especially used to love building dams across the river again sometimes with other people a lot of times just by myself i think i just loved the woods so much because no one was ever out there if i ran into someone out there id usually hide until they went away and so there was free rein for me to make them and myself whatever i wanted they were my woods and my imagination was liberated to fill them with adventures of the epic scale that i loved reading about

2699606 since the network economy is so new we as a society have paid little attention to how standards are created and how they grow but we should notice because once implemented a successful standard tends to remain forever and standards themselves shape behavior

2699616 quotes from players big pictures i read about teams coming in from manchester and then boston and would come down and watch man there were some players
2699617 it was him and his brother former nfl offensive lineman justin cross and rodney mcquate on the same team they were monstrous we used to rise to the occasion against them mainly because of the nba connection
2699618 theyd bring 30 or 40 people with them with coolers the hill next to the court would be packed with people with lawn chairs
2699619 all kinds of people in manchester looked forward to coming to the games with us mostly so that we could all go out in portsmouth afterwards
2699620 the league used to start on market square day that was the kick off to our summers that really was the fun of the league the camaraderie and the portsmouth scene
2699621 and the biggest highlight for us was sitting on the hill after games watching the next games and getting into our coolers

2699651 im totally surprised its not often a 45 year old can win a race
2699652 its a beautiful town on a beautiful day and the crowds were great
2699653 it was great day it was nice to run in the sun and not the rain
2699654 i definitely had to push because iworsky is good and you knew you had pressure behind you
2699655 i took it out hard because i saw a bunch of high school kids cross country kids
2699656 so i thought theyd take it out hard but they must have been on break or something because i found myself alone behind the police cruiser
2699657 the first part of the race went great i was right where i wanted to be at 5 52 for the first mile and then i just started slowing down i dont know what happened
2699658 it could be because im training for a triathlon next weekend and ive been spending more time on the bike and less time on the road and my legs felt it mastin was getting closer and if it wouldve been another mile he probably wouldve taken me
2699659 it wasnt my fastest time but it was a good time and ill take it
2699660 at the third mile i figured if i can still run go for it and i never looked back
2699661 i dont get too competitive in that respect i just try to run and hold on and do the best i can do
2699662 its a good course with some flat spots that lets you push a little bit
2699663 usually in national recessions there are one region or two that get completely crushed and everyone else holds up well thats not the case this go around
2699664 the only big economy that has held together well is texas everywhere else it is shades of black
2699665 the two key common denominators are housing and autos but it is broadening out now and financial services are becoming more of a problem in more states
2699666 michigan is either the weakest or second weakest economy mostly due to the misfortunes of the auto industry
2699667 aside from michigan the rest of the midwest is generally struggling with weakness in the auto sector and other consumer durable goods
2699668 whats scary to me is i cant get a handle on that
2699669 anything related to technology and aerospace has held up because thats export oriented and kind of fits the story line
2699670 north carolina tennessee and texas all appear to be gaining exports are up however particularly for capital equipment and forestry and mining products
2699671 in addition production is being shifted back to many of these states from overseas bmw is downsizing in germany and expanding in spartanburg s c volkswagen just announced a new plant will be built in chattanooga tenn and kia is building a plant near lagrange georgia
2699672 the carolinas tennessee georgia and alabama are holding up better than many other parts of the country because their housing markets never really got overpriced like florida washington d c and california
2699673 as a result population growth has remained strong and actually accelerated in the carolinas increased foreign direct investment has been an added plus particularly in alabama and georgia
2699674 there is a strategic focus on sending messages to high level officials within the government
2699675 im hypocritical brass thats why im here taking in the shade
2699676 these cartel leaders are starting to feel the pain and the natural response is to up the ante in terms of violence
2699677 the costs are very high and that is the pressure that calderon will face in the coming months and years
2699678 the biggest surprise about the whole thing is that there really has been no surprise

2699694 not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere
2699695 it is the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
2699696 no one understands this better than israels enemies that is precisely why they still engage in a systematic campaign to erase the historical link of the jews to this great city for if israel were severed from jerusalem the jewish state would lose its sense of legitimacy and its will to fight only then could israel be destroyed
2699697 cantor is a real conservative who is a star he is amazing he would fire me up to have him on the ticket
2699698 hes worked hard around the country to try to build bridges and support among the jewish community and he did that very effectively as the only member of the house leadership republican or jewish it gives him substantial credibility to help reach out in that direction
2699699 i think that when it comes to israel all that gets set aside
2699700 he is pro life pro family pro free market pro military dynamic and young
2699701 eric cantor will provide a dynamism that does not exist in the republican campaign

2699714 boxing gets a bad rap because the object is to hurt somebody but its really the safest contact sport out there because of the precautions we take
2699715 in the odd case you get an accident but hockey and football are much more dangerous
2699716 its a shame when something like tavuis injury happens because it gives a false impression to people
2699717 we very much care not to have any neurologic injury and the most important thing is not to be arrogant and to miss something there was a tremendous amount of concern for this young man and in a way i almost feel bad because i think it will be a very routine thing
2699718 i dont enjoy such injuries because it can always happen to me
2699719 its an honour to be leading ive been training really hard for this
2699720 but were only four races into this this is a very long event were not even halfway through ill take it one day and one race at a time and just keep on moving
2699721 he had a fantastic opportunity to protest me and probably get me disqualified so i had to take a penalty turn which cost me distance
2699722 its the olympics and you try and you do anything you can to get an advantage on your opponent and most of the fleet try and give me a hard time when they can
2699723 hes sailing really well hes been in the class for three years and continually improving we will have to see if we can give him a hard time in the next couple of days
2699724 anytime you think you can get close to michael phelps he jumps another level
2699725 that was the difference in the race which its kind of gratifying to see that happen after many years of trying to make it happen he paced it really well he didnt use too much energy on the butterfly he did the backstroke at the right effort level and then when he knew he was going to have to really put it into the breaststroke he did
2699726 it hit me today that that was his best race
2699727 i said to bob i wanted to sing on the medal podium but i just couldnt stop crying
2699728 everything that happened this year the ups and downs weve had this year and ryan is coming on like a freight train i was just happy to get the first one under my belt thinking about all that just made me start getting more and more emotional
2699729 he was shaking and tearing up at the same time
2699730 i was like well you just got a gold medal at the olympics
2699731 coming into the last 25 to 50 meters of the race in athens i saw myself out there alone and i just sort of smiled
2699732 just sitting there watching this morning watching michael phelps set a world record it was something that was special to me because it made me realise how many people are inspired by him and that im now in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country
2699733 today was a little different this is even different than a davis cup davis cup is thrilling exciting definitely a little nervous but out here was crazy
2699734 its about as humid as ive ever played in and i live in florida

2699764 in the first place pains must be taken that if possible so no discord should arise between friends but in case it does then our care should be that the friendships appear to have burned out rather than to have been stamped out and you must indeed be on your guard lest friendships change into serious enmities which are the source of disputes abuse and invective yet even these if endurable are to be borne and such respect is to be paid to the old time friendship that he may be in the wrong who committed the offense and not he who suffered it in short there is but one security and one provision against these ills and annoyances and that is neither to enlist your love too quickly nor to fix it on unworthy men now they are worthy of friendship who have within their souls the reason for being loved a rare class indeed and really everything splendid is rare and nothing is harder to find than something which in all respects is a perfect specimen of its kind but the majority of men recognize nothing whatever in human experience as good unless it brings them some profit and they regard friends as they do their cattle valuing most highly those which give hope of the largest gain thus do they fail to attain that loveliest most spontaneous friendship which is desirable in and for itself and they do not learn from their own experience what the power of such a friendship is and are ignorant of its nature and extent but most men unreasonably not to say shamelessly want a friend to be such as they cannot be themselves and require from friends what they themselves do not bestow but the fair things is first of all to be a good man yourself and then to seek another like yourself it is among such people that this stability of friendship may be made secure a troublesome thing is truth if it is indeed the source of hate which poisons friendship but much more troublesome is complaisance obsequium amicos veritas odium parit complaisance the desire to oblige and or fall in with anothers taste or flatter another gets us friends while speaking the truth gets us enemies

2699814 it has never before been necessary for any organisation to define a word that has been in common every day use so i see no reason why it was necessary on this occasion
2699815 astronomers use adjectives such as giant and dwarf to describe different subclasses of objects like planets stars and galaxies so why could pluto not remain as a dwarf planet just as jupiter is a giant planet
2699816 also around 90 per cent of the planets we know now are outside our solar system but under the international astronomical unions definition they cannot be classed as planets
2699817 the goal was really to try to have authors helping each other get more exposure the idea was partly based on the 60s music festivals the monterey pop festival made big stars out of the then little known jimi hendrix janis joplin and otis redding none of them could have pulled in the crowd that they pulled in together but having them all on the same bill allowed people who many never have heard of most of them to experience their music i dont know if we have the equivalent of otis redding in this collection but you never know every time nikki andrews tells someone about the book shes helping to support the career of amber marshall every time amber tells someone about the book shes helping to expose jonathan wood to new fans

2699839 weve met so many people from all over the united states canada and even australia
2699840 we go to new england college and this is a good place to catch up its so pretty and fun here on the pier
2699841 im here at prescott park enjoying the music and eating and reading my union leader its so great to have this nice sunny day to be outside
2699842 were having our monthly outing here at prescott park were red hat ladies were waiting for 10 more of us to join up its great to be here today its just perfect weather
2699843 i am enjoying this nice weather before i go back to work its fun to have a walk around town on such a great day
2699844 i always get stuck here and my air conditioner isnt working
2699845 lets go over to the brewery and see if theres anyone there
2699846 look at those 1 inch lamb chops i have some crowder peas and early butter beans too

2699852 the roof needs to be stripped sheathed and shingled and the windows need to be replaced the dock needs work too the siding looks fine its a shame a real waste of an asset
2699853 if you want your kids on a see saw take them to the park
2699854 what i dont get is how they get the excavators out of the hole
2699855 when i came in the city had a lot of work to be done
2699856 weve had some operators that needed absolutely no guidance took their business very seriously and went after education opportunities
2699857 weve had others who needed a lot of assistance and education and unfortunately a few places have had to close for repairs
2699858 sometimes getting into these old buildings and trying to find out whats going on takes a monumental effort
2699859 what we are finding with some of the older facilities is we have to spend an inordinate amount of time to get them up to code and running
2699860 i dont think her objective is to get anyone into the news its about protecting the public and the business owner so they dont find themselves in a civil suit because someone got ill
2699861 i think anybody doing a good job in the industry appreciates her
2699862 were not in the business to make people sick and were not in the business to operate out of code

2699867 borat cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan
2699868 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
2699869 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
2699870 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
2699871 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
2699872 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
2699873 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
2699874 we wouldnt have wanted to do something that didnt reflect the show and didnt respect the audiences investment in the show and what made it different and unique
2699875 the police have gone way over the top its disgusting you hardly notice the campers its the police making all the noise and creating all the aggro they have the helicopter constantly circling round and their dogs barking theyre the ones causing the problems
2699876 the atmosphere was really nice and welcoming and everyone seemed kind and lively
2699877 we need to look at the cost of the technology and the cost return
2699878 outcomes assessment and instructional development for faculty across degree programs
2699879 when i came in the city had a lot of work to be done
2699880 weve had some operators that needed absolutely no guidance took their business very seriously and went after education opportunities
2699881 weve had others who needed a lot of assistance and education and unfortunately a few places have had to close for repairs

2699886 were not in the business to make people sick and were not in the business to operate out of code
2699887 the baby was in her removable car seat sleeping on the patio and kirra was playing
2699888 i was right there and had most of the area raked out when i heard rustling
2699889 so what do i do i scream which i know youre not supposed to do i grabbed the kids and ran inside
2699890 wed been to storyland the day before and she saw all the animals so i think she was a little bit unfazed by the animal watching by the time we saw the bear
2699891 i think if i didnt have the kids i would have been like oh what a cute bear
2699892 but my hands were shaking so badly once we got inside
2699893 black bears are very opportunistic eaters most of their diet consists of grasses roots berries and insects they will also eat fish and mammals including carrion and easily develop a taste for human foods and garbage
2699894 i heard something brush against the house outside and i thought ok thats bigger than a mouse
2699895 ive had people randomly talk to me about starting after labor day
2699896 i always thought it was good because i like a slow start
2699897 what weve found is its a really nice transition back to school
2699898 on the monday we come together as a teaching staff then the kids come in tuesday wednesday and thursday theyre off on friday and mondays a holiday
2699899 we used to hear from businesses about high school kids working
2699900 we start with three days and then the long holiday weekend so they can be there at work
2699901 wed have been pushing into that last week in june we had two days to make up
2699902 weve started before labor day for the last eight to 10 years to get in enough school days for snow days and teacher in service days and try to be out at a reasonable time in june
2699903 its somethings weve been doing for quite for a few years
2699904 we have a calendar committee we work with the portsmouth school department
2699905 we actually have meetings with a committee and teachers we have surveys that go out to the community
2699906 would extend our year lately with the weather were getting out later
2699907 people think the days in the beginning of the year are more productive than late june
2699908 the concept behind it is to celebrate people places and products that make maine so special
2699909 weve a got a wide variety of vendors theres a whole list of people working together to make this festival happen
2699910 this is a perfect place for families to come and were all about family events
2699911 we cover it with sand to keep all air out and it sits there and cooks for 20 hours
2699912 the reason we come is to reinforce the local aspect and let the consumer understand when they buy cabot cheese theyre helping preserve the rural landscape
2699913 its for our farmers the more we get that message out the better
2699914 were very proud of it and its a great opportunity to sell the juice
2699915 that single investment in the resources of the committed veterans of the united states of america has had a huge impact
2699916 its sometimes fashionable to say the government cant do anything right but i think our government along with help from the american legion got that one right
2699917 we all owe all veterans a great debt of service and gratitude
2699918 we should all be giving to you yet the american legion gives so much to our community and to our country
2699919 thats the kind of country we are that youll find pretty much across the spectrum people who stepped up and served
2699920 i had my mother crash the party because its her dad that carried shrapnel around in his body his whole life
2699921 sixty percent of our people are the working poor so they do have jobs however with the cost of energy and food they have to make a decision
2699922 we are up about 30 percent versus last year in distribution yet inventory has been down about 30 percent the increased demand and resources is a tough scale to balance
2699923 were sending out 15 000 pounds a day typically keeping up with the demand is a challenge for us and the demand is not just the seacoast area its national across the country we hear it every day
2699924 food we thought would last is gone that is off the scale for us it doesnt look like its going back to normal very soon
2699925 we had five families in desperate need just this past week
2699926 there is no major holiday no kids in school to come up with drives and the civic organizations that help us during the summer are not active and so we are forgotten
2699927 its been a three year trend weve noticed and it continues to get worse
2699928 we are really trying to take a proactive stance and offer more outreach programs nutrition education for families on a budget and sending home backpacks with food and nutritional information to needy children on weekends we are really trying to look at other ways to reach people
2699929 were down at the food pantry not having what were needing
2699930 we are an after school enrichment and summer program of intentional engaging activities
2699931 we bus from portsmouth middle school but any kids are welcome here we are a free program so any help is welcomed
2699932 we offer a wide range of things we do big trips there are arts and adventure trips we have sports programs a new media program and a newspaper any child who comes here gets matched up with a mentor the kids love our programs and come for the same one week in and week out
2699933 we raised about 40 000 last year and most of our sponsors are returning this year
2699934 we get that income stream into the hands of new heights its a tough climate for charities but we seem to be holding our own of all the charity tournaments where else can you have a lobster lunch and hit a few balls by the atlantic
2699935 at one stage one of our players was standing 20m away from him and i asked why you would actually allow andrew mcleod to stand on a halfback flank by himself at that particular point
2699936 thats what happens when you start worrying about what the scoreboard says rather than just playing sometimes that switches the brain off which is not great in any standard of footy
2699937 we wanted to get the ball in as quick as we possibly could their ability to hold their structure defensively was very good early
2699938 our inability to engage their defenders was very poor and the times we did get it in we were outnumbered
2699939 we still clearly at the moment havent been able to get our game structure going and our style going against the better sides in the competition and probably the sides whove played a bit of finals footy
2699940 what you need to be able to do is either stand up and have your structure stand up or be able to fight out a really dour one on one struggle when conditions were like today
2699941 from the seasons perspective we all know how the premiership table is tightening up so it was a pretty critical game for both clubs
2699942 its good for us because a win makes it a bit better for andrew great for him
2699943 we kicked over 100 points in those conditions and for our forward line to have 12 goal scorers weve just got to keep finding ways of making sure we can kick a score
2699944 in the first half i thought our kicking in particular was very good and we got some really powerful running which you could argue weve lacked a bit
2699945 were bitterly disappointed with our performance season on the line stuff and to come over and not play our game style was disappointing
2699946 it started virtually from the first kick of the game

2699985 i attended a couple of introductory evening classes in counselling
2699986 what i can wholeheartedly say is that there were many many times when
2699987 i once heard someone say that youre either part of the problem or
2699988 i suppose my biggest bugbear is the fact that people of all ages in
