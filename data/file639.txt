6390203 as part of the exchange caltech astronomers in collaboration with swinburne astronomers will have greater access to state of the art supercomputing instrumentation on australias radio telescope facilities joint symposia are being planned as well as student exchanges
6390204 we now have the right combination of outstanding individuals and phenomenal technology to achieve rapid high impact discovery
6390205 the keck telescopes instrumentation is a portal to the early universe it will enable us to provide undergraduates with a view of what the universe was like billions of years ago from the remote operations centre to be established on campus
6390206 there is a surprising abundance of massive galactic systems both star forming and passive in these early epochs of the universe
6390207 this contradicts our current theoretical models which suggest mega galaxies should be fewer at this time as they should only have accreted or clumped together later on due to their gravitational attraction to one another
6390208 this observation challenges the models subscribed to by many astronomers in which galaxies build up hierarchically by merging it implies that star formation in massive clumps of dark matter started early was highly efficient and was later strongly quenched
6390209 the reasons why there should be such a sharp peak in star formation early on are unclear and this is one of the questions we hope to answer
6390210 we wont just be looking at the biggest and the brightest galaxies but also at the more average ones similar to our own milky way
6390211 we will be asking which types evolve the fastest the massive ones or the much smaller ones
6390212 and we will be examining the rich galactic clusters where many galaxies are coming together and trying to measure the speed at which their stars and gas rotate and see how this is affected by the proximity of others
6390213 galactic clusters are bound together by gravity and this defines the structure of the universe
6390214 there are a few issues to be resolved but in principle it is do able
6390215 an advantage is that night time in hawaii when observation takes place is afternoon in australia and ideal for the public to see whats going on ultimately too we hope to be able to actually control the keck telescopes from swinburne itself
6390216 senior cb castine bridges returned to practice after resting tuesday and he participated in most everything despite donning the red injury bib still bridges broke up a pass intended for wr jeremy maclin at one point early on in 11 on 11 work later in the session freshman lb will ebner intercepted a ball over the middle as the reserves went against each other
6390217 chase coffman and danario alexander both participated in practice with red pullovers on they were held out of full contact drills but both caught passes jared perry is still out with a shoulder injury brian coulter whose mri was negative according to mizzou was also in a pullover
6390218 freshman defensive end aldon smith practiced for the first time on wednesday after getting clearance from the ncaa eligibility center on tuesday he lined up behind fellow freshman marcus malbrough on the stretch lines its safe to say smith will redshirt this season after missing the first two and a half weeks of camp
6390219 because of injuries to danario alexander and jared perry no position could reveal more today than receiver where true freshmen jarrell jackson and gahn mcgaffie could get extra playing time

6390221 sabotage the nation and reverse the progress we have so far made as a democratic nation
6390222 some foreign entities who are hell bent on creating instability in nigeria in order to play down the growing influence of nigeria in regional and international affairs
6390223 the honourable minister of defence alhaji yayale ahmed regrets any inconveniences the postponement might cause all those invited to the retreat especially former heads of state and royal fathers
6390224 the call for an interim government has no place in the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria and is therefore not only illegal but also treasonable to the extent that it calls for the overthrow of an established constitutional order
6390225 idle talk that can only emanate from a warped mind the allegation by the pdp that the opposition is seeking to undermine the federal government and reaching out to foreign interests for that purpose
6390226 the allegation by the pdp amounts to shooting the breeze and it is the work of a ruling party that has no initiative on how to address the plethora of problems facing the country and how to ensure better life for the countrys long suffering citizens
6390227 apparently confronted by the enormity of the problems facing the nation and without any idea on how to go about it pdp leadership and the governments it controls at federal and state levels are fast descending into a frightening level of paranoia which can only worsen the problems of lack of basic infrastructure insecurity food crisis and militancy in the niger delta just to mention a few it said
6390228 if the regular efforts by the opposition to point the government to the right direction is what the pdp has misconstrued as an attempt to undermine the federal government then those running the pdp must immediately undertake a crash course in constitutional democracy
6390229 at no time did we say we were raising money for obama what we are saying is that obama is for the world and he has been getting support from europeans from arabs and from all over and nigerians should not be left out

6390245 pour une femme jai un caract re un peu sp cial
6390246 im not here to get a tracksuit or to just make the games thats what i did in 1996 i think i came 26th there
6390247 i was satisfied then but 20th place today i dont do this to make teams any more i do this to win medals
6390248 today i was hoping to do that again and thats why i continued on after athens because i really thought i had more in me and i could do it
6390249 ive had faith in my body and my mind that i could do it so it was just a horrible feeling when you dont do it
6390250 my guess is with this big a spike in the local cost of living its going to be hard for wages to keep up
6390251 they have to get their fertilizer and seed from the lower 48 too
6390252 theres two trains of thought if you win tonight you guarantee yourselves a medal but it could put her under the pump
6390253 so all of that will be considered by the medical team certainly in consultation with penny the athlete who needs to make some calls herself whether she feels comfortable suiting up tonight or deferring it
6390254 for her another two days recovery would be ideal and that may be the way we have to go it the decision could be as close to one hour out from game time
6390255 at the moment she didnt do training this morning and the doctor and physio will have a look at her and her agility work in the warm up time frame but i think shes pretty doubtful at this stage probably 50 50 at this stage
6390256 obviously if we can hold her off that would be the ideal world
6390257 but were playing the host nation china and thats a fairly big challenge for us
6390258 our preparation has been totally focused on the likelihood that she would not suit up for tonight
6390259 we want the verdict as far this side of election day as possible
6390260 because i wanted alaskans to have a first hand opportunity to learn the facts of this matter
6390261 i understand the courts decision today and continue to have every faith in the fairness of the american judicial system and the courts commitment to conduct a speedy trial
6390262 i welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that i am innocent of these changes
6390263 they didnt have to bring this 28 days before a primary and 98 days before the election
6390264 this court went to great lengths i emphasize great lengths to rearrange its calendar
6390265 this is a proper venue for the crimes charged in the indictment
6390266 these forms are very important they serve a very important public function
6390267 i think its about some forms and some statements made in the district of columbia
6390268 so far thank god thats not a crime in america
6390269 if he slips into declaring himself innocent i say great for him

6390281 its just preliminary but im pretty confident of the results
6390282 just given the proximity and the frequency of their being seen in that country its just unlikely that theres a mix up
6390283 im not suggesting that weve got all the brown bears on record but the only other sow that we know with cubs this year never ventures in that part of the world
6390284 male brown bears are notorious cub killers and theyll munch that guy in a heartbeat
6390285 weve had unusual bear activity this year and we think it was the right thing to do for public safety
6390286 since we cant clearly know that it was a rogue bear and not just increased bear activity we are going to maintain the closure
6390287 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public
6390288 it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate

6390353 contrary to intuition because the uranian satellites are much less massive than those of jupiter

6390370 i ran to get a spare key from elsie upstairs but when we opened her living room door smoke just engulfed the whole place we couldnt see and we were choking so we had to come out again
6390371 it was awful to see her when the firemen brought her out and its really sad that she couldnt get out
6390372 it was so upsetting she was a nice lady and she really loved her family they used to come and visit her every day to cook her meals and theyd take her on holiday with them

6390383 there is clearly a relationship between economic development and the level of technology existing in a country a well thought out programme that is technology driven and technically oriented by our country will transform our economy and provide jobs for millions of our graduates that are job seekers
6390384 in advancing his argument for a sustainable economic growth through science and technology mitchell 1977 posits that technology is the science of industrial arts the systematic application of various branches of knowledge to practical tasks the implication of this is that the scientific application of this knowledge would provide a ready made avenue to empower many to make the society a better place
6390385 invention and construction of machines and fabrication of diverse tools such as ice block making block making farm equipment cassava processing machines and many more are things that can encourage self employment and increase wealth creation awareness in addition it will bring about practical value and benefits such as improved health longer lives and relief from pains shorter working days under safer and easier condition more and better food clothes and housing opportunities for education entertainment and leisure it will contribute to increased export earnings when breakthroughs are made for instance in the fields of minerals extraction or agro processing
6390386 we need to systematically target young people with ability and provide them with career guidance and inspiration we have to grow science knowledge workers at a robust pace to breathe new life into the sector

6390390 theres a good crowd that comes here and were really pleased to be celebrating 100 years
6390391 its a good traditional pub with a beer garden and pool tables and i think we have a good family atmosphere here
6390392 the bowling green at the back is a hit in the summer and we get lots of people come down and as long as theyre not wearing high heels they can have a game

6390394 ash was a really lovely gentle man to see so many people at his funeral showed how much he touched peoples lives
6390395 he was very sociable but very modest too and intelligent its just been horrific for us since he died
6390396 he was a great person and its been devastating for all of us because he would always take the others out when he came to see cameron so we were still all a family together
6390397 he used to love writing poems and stories just for himself really but im going to compile them and give them to cameron when he gets a bit older
6390398 its such a fantastic thing for alan to do and im really grateful
6390399 my other children still have their dads around to give them a legacy for the future but cameron wont have that and i think alan just wanted to do something to help
6390400 i was so shocked when debbie told me ash had died
6390401 he was one of the nicest men you could meet he was gentle and kind and worked hard he was a really great guy
6390402 you dont expect someone of that age to die of a heart attack and its such a shame for cameron
6390403 my grandson michael goes to school with cameron and i just wanted to do my best for the little boy

6390410 in my experience people who are victim to sexual abuse as a child rarely get over it it can mean flash backs and memories triggered by something as simple as a smell
6390411 it impacts on people throughout their adult lives and can cause problems with relationships it can also cause difficulties in holding down a job because it can result in people having a mistrust of those in authority
6390412 the judge indicated that there was an overwhelming likelihood green will face an immediate and significant sentence of imprisonment when he is sentenced next month this can only be right and proper given the dreadful abuse he subjected a succession of young boys to
6390413 it is highly probable that there are a number of men still living in manchester who are either too frightened or ashamed to come forward
6390414 i would however urge them to either contact the police or speak to me in confidence in order to bring closure to their ordeal
6390415 we have co operated with the authorities since the beginning of the investigation

6390423 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart he said
6390424 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge he said
6390425 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area

6390626 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6390627 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6390628 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6390629 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6390630 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6390631 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6390632 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6390633 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6390634 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show

6390662 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart he said
6390663 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge he said
6390664 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6390665 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded said zaheer shah of edhi rescue pakistans largest private charity
6390666 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work shah said

6390715 were very pleased with the wheat winter barley and the spring barley
6390716 we had a very heavy hailstorm a week prior to combining the wheat and the zebedee lost about two cwt through shedding
6390717 at the moment its alright but if we get another week of this weather it will really start to suffer
6390718 i am more depressed than i was during foot and mouth
6390719 i cut 90 acres last week and it was just about acceptable now everything has grown out and looks horrible it is really desperate
6390720 global demand for meat and milk is going to continue to increase so were going to need skilled farmers to deliver the goods and in turn competent advisers to help them
6390721 i want to be part of that future action but to meet increased demand for sound technical advice theres going to be a need for a lot more trained young people its simply a case of being aware of whats out there
6390722 when i was studying and starting to investigate the options available i remember taking the careers directory off the shelf and finding lots of opportunities for accountants bankers lawyers and other mainstream professions but there was no mention of ruminant nutritionist
6390723 thats what sparked my interest and led me to sign up for a degree in animal science at the
6390724 the course featured hands on r amp d including a work placement year which i spent with what was then adas this gave me real inspiration to follow my degree with a phd in nutritional biochemistry at nottingham looking at improving the fatty acid profile of lamb meat
6390725 ive moved through various jobs here to my current position of ruminant nutritionist with kw alternative feeds requiring me to provide technical support to our 23 field sales specialists that means i can be out on farm during the day with a member of our sales staff formulating a high performance dairy or beef ration before moving on to an evening meeting presenting to 100 farmers the next day i might be office based writing technical support material before going off to provide technical training for sales staff

6390727 we have had measurable rain on 17 of the first 20 days of august i dont think i can ever remember having that
6390728 i suspect the wheat is losing hagberg now the glasgow was starting to sprout when we cut it
6390729 the worry is that the quality starts to go but i dont think our wheat will be ripe enough to sprout yet

6390753 anyone who visits calton hill will realise that investment is needed in the area
6390754 but theres a combination of new business and new development coming to the area which is raising the tone and bringing life back to what has been quite a quiet and sometimes deserted area we can combine that with contributions towards physical improvements
6390755 there are a lot of people who will never go to calton hill after dusk and i can understand why but its a fantastic view they miss out on and i think everyone should be able to see it at nighttime
6390756 calton hill is an important heritage spot that attracts tourists and its iconic not only to look at but to look from
6390757 i do get representations from all over the city asking if we can do something about it
6390758 the result of this crackdown is great news for road safety in edinburgh
6390759 since car tax can only be purchased with a valid mot and insurance certificate it reduces the number of potentially dangerous untaxed uninsured and unroadworthy vehicles on the road
6390760 this helps to make the roads a safer place for everyone our figures show that eight out of ten cars impounded for being untaxed are also without insurance
6390761 from a drivers perspective the number of uninsured drivers or those without licences on the roads is probably of more concern
6390762 i do have concerns that the dvla records are notoriously unreliable there have been a number of cases where cars have been destroyed because of mistakes in the dvla database or by its on street enforcers
6390763 nothing has come from management and theyve never said to us that theyll change procedures
6390764 this was just a big misunderstanding i went into the fire station to see if i could help i spent a couple of hours at the station then helped lots of people at the fire whats wrong with that
6390765 he was obviously credible to the extent that he was given the keys for a red cross vehicle and as it happened an incident did take place
6390766 mr gleeson got into a car with emergency signage and blue lights and drove to this incident
6390767 it was obvious to members of the fire service there that he should not have been in attendance
6390768 we have tightened up our procedures in conjunction with the red cross to prevent an incident like this happening again
6390769 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land
6390770 it will be a major event that will celebrate scotland in a city like edinburgh we are used to having international performers on our doorstep but a growing number of people also want to celebrate their own history and culture
6390771 it will be a car version of the edinburgh cow parade and i think it will definitely capture the imagination as a major one off event the cow parade was a real mix of professional art and art at a community level and this should be similar
6390772 the cow parade which had the whole of edinburgh talking when it hit town two years ago showed the impact that a community art event can have and we have high hopes that the car parade will be a similar success
6390773 there will be so much going on in edinburgh next year from art exhibitions to events including the gathering when more than 8000 clansmen and women from around the world will descend on edinburgh
6390774 if new owners were to come onboard or baa were to sell glasgow we would expect that there would be substantial investment in edinburgh in order to compete effectively with glasgow especially on long haul routes
6390775 we will be looking to plan which routes to operate the boeing dreamliner aircraft we have on order a key factor when deciding whether we will fly from glasgow or edinburgh will be the services available for these long haul aircraft
6390776 there are differences in the airports infrastructure and this is likely to change if they were in competition
6390777 there are issues about the number of long haul direct flights that go into edinburgh and there has been criticism in the past that baa has been slow to invest in edinburgh in this regard
6390778 any suggestion that this airport may be sold could seriously put at risk the citys economic future
6390779 we could not welcome anything which might risk the competitive position of the city

6390798 weve never had any complaints the guys who work round here have offered to write stating they have no objections there has never been an accident or staff injured but moving the van overnight would put staff at risk
6390799 we have been told if we have been here more than eight years we cant be forced to move
6390800 we can apply for planning permission but it would only be granted for five years and after that it would be put out to tender we could lose the spot weve been in for all these years so were looking for another option
6390801 its just this one official hes got a bee in his bonnet he doesnt have any objection to us staying here at peak hours but he does to us staying here from 8pm 6am which i find very strange
6390802 i have had a street traders licence at south gyle crescent for the last 11 years the snack van i own has been in the same fixed position for over 25 years and has never moved
6390803 in my view it seems ridiculous to ask 20 plus snack vans in close vicinity all to move during peak traffic hours
6390804 surely this has a greater risk of accidents to the public than to be left stationary
6390805 the sco has demonstrated specific results in the years of its existence and its future is cloudless
6390806 more than 55 000 people die in scotland each year palliative care should be an integral part of the support given to patients and their families and carers
6390807 in many areas of scotland the voluntary sector and the health service provide excellent care but access to good quality palliative care varies across the country
6390808 from an international level having this one facility in glasgow is fine but from a grassroots point of view we need two three or even four across scotland because parents wont be able to take their kids through to glasgow all the time to train
6390809 all we need in edinburgh is a 200m track that can be placed inside a building it doesnt have to be international standard
6390810 this is scotlands capital city and i think the current regime has the responsibility to maintain and improve facilities for future generations
6390811 we committed to over 30m of investment in sports facilities in our last budget and i think thats a very strong sign in terms of this administrations commitment to sport
6390812 we are investing millions in new grassroots facilities across scotland helping increase participation and nurture our sporting stars of tomorrow
6390813 anti littering laws are applicable to all city residents and visitors including city of edinburgh council employees
6390814 whilst most people are law abiding individuals who drop litter can be issued with a 50 fixed penalty notice the message is simple if you drop litter you can be fined if you fail to pay the fine you will be reported to the procurator fiscal environmental wardens patrol all areas of the city
6390815 recently a member of staff from waverley court was served with a 50 fixed penalty notice and reported to the procurator fiscal for smoking related litter littering by council staff is a particular embarrassment to the council
6390816 we all represent the council during work hours and the public expect a high standard of behaviour wardens will continue to regularly patrol the areas outside council buildings
6390817 the city centre and parks teams have been working hard to clean up the city centre and improve its visual appearance we would expect this effort to be supported by staff in council buildings by being vigilant about litter
6390818 in particular we would encourage staff to dispose of cigarette litter in the bins provided managers of staff without e mail access should make sure their staff are aware of the content of this message
6390819 this person must feel a bit of a twit to be served with a fine by a council colleague
6390820 it is an embarrassment for the council council workers and councillors have to be careful not to bring embarrassment to their employers
6390821 if anyone drops litter they have to pay the consequences i can never understand why people dont put cigarette butts in the litter bins
6390822 diese eile war ein wesentlicher grund f r das ganze desaster

6390830 twilight basketball is already making a real difference to the lives of young people in many parts of glasgow blighted by antisocial behaviour and gang activity
6390831 we currently have a golden opportunity to achieve a permanent change away from car use towards public transport
6390832 soaring prices on the forecourt have made public transport an attractive option for people who would otherwise drive but this will only continue if it remains cost effective
6390833 it is essential that the government takes action to ensure that the current move towards increased use of public transport is not just a flash in the pan

6390840 ya no es posible recuerda natalie moureau economista y especialista de la cultura evaluar una obra en funci n de sus caracter sticas materiales y particularmente de su adecuaci n a un patr n de belleza como ocurr a en los tiempos de la academia otros criterios como el saber hacer el trabajo la innovaci n la t cnica el dominio del oficio la originalidad y la autenticidad operan poco en la evaluaci n de una obra de arte
6390841 ahora el comprador certifica al artista as como la academia lo hac a en el siglo xviii
6390842 entendemos por eso precisa natalie moureau durante una entrevista el conjunto de recursos que sostienen la extensi n y el tama o de su red de influencias y la capacidad para cada uno de sus miembros de hacer conocer y reconocer su poder de legitimaci n en materia de arte contempor neo si tomamos la lista de los 200 mayores coleccionistas se descubrir por ejemplo que la mayor a de ellos pertenece al consejo de administraci n de alg n museo
6390843 los criterios tradicionales que fundamentan el valor de una obra en los mercados del arte antiguo de los impresionistas y modernos ya no se aplican al particular mercado del arte contempor neo
6390844 es verdad que una gran cantidad de coleccionistas compran obras en galer as reconocidas porque saben que el galerista garantizar tanto la perennidad de la obra como el apoyo de su mercado pero tambi n existe una buena cantidad de coleccionistas en mi opini n la mayor a sobre todo entre los europeos que compran obras con las cuales desean vivir m s ac o m s all de cualquier consideraci n de mercado
6390845 a t tulo de comparaci n la galer a gagosian presente tanto en beverly hills como en nueva york londres y roma tiene una facturaci n anual al menos quince veces superior a la nuestra que es de 15 millones de euros
6390846 como el comprador elige con frecuencia artistas de su propia nacionalidad a veces por simples razones de proximidad geogr fica los artistas anglosajones est n hoy entre los mejor cotizados
6390847 aunque no importe quien puede convertirse en pl stico ni importe quien trate de serlo todos no podr n lograrlo porque hace falta un m nimo de audiencia ciertamente esto no es nuevo pero lo que s lo es es que no hay un v nculo l gico entre el hecho de seguir un recorrido t pico profesional o educativo y la obtenci n de esa audiencia para tener xito ahora basta con saber venderse
6390848 la cultura de la inmediatez las formas deben ser comprensibles e inmediatamente seductoras mirar un jeff koons exige menos esfuerzo que otros artistas
6390849 si no hubiera nada en ella piensa usted realmente que un coleccionista habr a pagado ese precio
6390850 en realidad concluye ir nicamente un observador del mercado el comprador ha conseguido no una pieza sino un precio un precio que constituye todo el valor de la pieza s lo que la pieza es a veces tan d bil que uno se pregunta si el dinero tiene todav a alg n valor en esos c rculos donde abunda
6390851 es el traspaso que debe pagarse para entrar en un circuito de relaciones donde cada uno es juzgado por criterios de solvencia un derecho de entrada espectacular para ecos medi ticos particularmente importantes para los nuevos empresarios de los pa ses emergentes
6390852 los compradores saben observa herv perdriolle especialista en arte indio que los precios del arte contempor neo indio pronto seguir n al crecimiento del pa s el punto positivo de ese repentino inter s es otorgar finalmente un reconocimiento financiero a grandes artistas que eran todav a ignorados en la escena internacional
6390853 all donde lleg bamos a interesar a cien personas para la primera venta de una obra hoy llegamos tal vez a 10 20 30 veces m s
6390854 cu ntos m s acontecimientos hay m s hay que producir y cu nto uno m s produce menos capaz se es de regenerar y de crear finalmente para m entrar en este sistema es negar mi calidad de artista
6390855 escuchan m s de lo que miran dice desolado un galerista pero c mo censurarlos cuando una cotizaci n se logra en quince d as cuando se promueve menos la cultura que su resultado uno termina deseando una crisis financiera para purgar algunas cotizaciones indecentes y sanear el mercado y para volver a encontrar los valores art sticos detr s de los valores financieros no olvidemos que el mercado del arte vive al ritmo de los ciclos econ micos y que en marea baja s lo las grandes piedras no resultan arrastradas

6390976 we are delighted to be making another film about quentin crisp given the naked civil servant was such a landmark film for itv its a real thrill and honour to be bringing an actor of john hurts stature back to the channel to reprise such an iconic role this is largely down to the quality of brian fillis wonderful script which completely captures the extraordinary and outrageous character of quentin crisp

6390988 after the collapse of the soviet union i was among the group of americans led by george kennan the father of containment theory senator sam nunn and the foreign policy expert michael mandelbaum that argued against expanding nato at that time
6390989 it seemed to us that since we had finally brought down soviet communism and seen the birth of democracy in russia the most important thing to do was to help russian democracy take root and integrate russia into europe wasnt that why we fought the cold war to give young russians the same chance at freedom and integration with the west as young czechs georgians and poles wasnt consolidating a democratic russia more important than bringing the czech navy into nato all of this was especially true because we argued there was no big problem on the world stage that we could effectively address without russia particularly iran or iraq russia wasnt about to reinvade europe
6390990 the clinton and bush foreign policy teams acted on the basis of two false premises
6390991 one was that russia is innately aggressive and that the end of the cold war could not possibly change this so we had to expand our military alliance up to its borders despite all the pious blather about using nato to promote democracy the belief in russias eternal aggressiveness is the only basis on which nato expansion ever made sense especially when you consider that the russians were told they could not join the other premise was that russia would always be too weak to endanger any new nato members so we would never have to commit troops to defend them it would cost us nothing they were wrong on both counts

6390999 when attending a discovery day program at corp hq dont limit your exposure to the talking heads that have been selected by the franchisor to meet greet and speak with you one of the best ways to test a corporate culture is to walk around the offices chat it up with the work a bees in the cubes gauge their moods and temperments the people reporting to work there daily either support franchisees directly or do the work in support of those who do if these people are not happy and passionate about what they do guess who will suffer for it downstream

6391233 its not always best to have two people the exact same hooking up together because you know theyll have nothing new to teach each other
6391234 we had such a great time making this movie im just so glad that our good feeling has come across on screen
6391235 even a third of the way into the shoot everyone was saying oh id love to do another one and given the box office it seems very likely that we will be
6391236 yeah nothings more painful than when you know the movie doesnt quite work
6391237 and were all being really polite hey how are you
6391238 aware thats a good way to put it we were aware of the bar that we had to try to reach because people especially in the united states love this series and we wanted to do it justice
6391239 thats the exact conversation we had when it came to working out the dynamics between our characters
6391240 or analysed it too much we just knew from my audition that we had chemistry and that we should take our cue from that it would see it through
6391241 yeah we used ourselves as a barometer of what might work
6391242 we would try a scene different ways to see what worked and we would always find one version where we would look at each other and say thats the one that works
6391243 because i think everything he does is funny so im a little biased
6391244 you know as soon as i say id go to a certain age ill probably fall in love with an 18 year old so i never like to be too specific about it
6391245 i think more than the age discrepancy between us the discrepancy in terms of physical attractiveness if people can get over that the age is really no issue at all
6391246 steve in addition to being named by life magazine as the funniest man in hollywood
6391247 i think we both approach the success with a grain of salt
6391248 were always sort of waiting for the other shoe to drop but enjoying as much as we can being in the moment i dont want to be one of those people who is clammering to stay where i am because if this is all the success i ever obtain then ive had plenty so i could gladly just remember this with fond memories
6391249 school of thought folks keep it or i dont take advantage of this is to say on my household were purchased from best buy
6391250 when they were asked to use the digital device so called feature fatigue set in they became frustrated with the plethora of options they had created and ended up happier with a simpler product
6391251 of course i do i clicked the button didnt i
6391252 well dozens of other people have used it and they dont sound like geniuses i can do what they do
6391253 dependency injection the reason for doing this is because it makes your code more testable and results in a little less boilerplate code
6391254 if you have an object to test then create the object to test and pass it the objects you want to test with
6391255 which hardware is best in terms of my limited for the sake of argument definition of scalability
6391256 we need a full month of off site jad sessions to gather requirements
6391257 we need uml diagrams for each class and interaction with rational rose
6391258 we just need to document key classes and flows lets use visio or staruml
6391259 youve got plenty of bugs on your plate let me fix that
6391260 yeah thats a troublesome piece of code can we do any refactoring and perhaps add more unit tests
6391261 rather than any kind of argument against or for a nca seems like just a soapbox article for giving your opinion on various technologies

6391266 architecture is about enabling business capabilities and software architects make artifacts that bring different view points to meet the business requirements identified earlier at a high level

6391268 the end state requirements are not known at programme initiation
6391269 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6391270 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6391271 these enormous price hikes will be a huge blow to millions of people already wondering just how theyre going to pay their bills this winter
6391272 we are extremely concerned that the one in three pensioner households likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of the year will feel forced to cut back on essential food or fuel
6391273 the government must seize control of this escalating crisis and take immediate action to ease the pressure on millions of households
6391274 as an emergency measure to help alleviate the problem this winter the government and energy companies should be working together to offer fuel vouchers to the poorest pensioners
6391275 but in order to stand a real chance of helping the poorest pensioners the government must make it mandatory for energy companies to offer social tariffs at the cheapest rates

6391281 when the kingdom of byzantium was subjected by the arabs practically the whole land belonged to the big proprietors while the soil was cultivated by the former owners who had remained on their plots as tenants
6391282 the palestinian arabs are the descendants of the philistines and of all semitic peoples who have lived in palestine since the time of the canaanites
6391283 the historical record disproves the zionist lie that palestine was undeveloped before the establishment of jewish settlements in palestine muqqadisi a native of jerusalem who died in 986 a d enumerated the principal products of palestine in the 10th century among whose agricultural produce was particularly copious and prized fruit of every kind olives figs grapes quinces plums apples dates walnuts almonds jujube and bananas
6391284 palestine is watered by the rains and dew its trees and plowed fields do not need artificial irrigation palestine is the most fertile of the syrian provinces
6391285 in 1615 the english traveler george sandys described palestine as a land that flows with milk and honey
6391286 the german geographer alexander scholch concluded that between 1856 and 1892 palestine produced a relatively large agricultural surplus which was marketed in neighboring countries
6391287 laurence oliphant who visited palestine in 1887 wrote that palestines valley of esdraelon was a huge green lake of waving wheat and it presents one of the most striking pictures of luxuriant fertility which it is possible to conceive
6391288 wheat shipments from the palestinian port of acre had helped to save southern france from famine on numerous occasions in the 17th and 18th centuries
6391289 in 1948 the zionists seized 90 percent of arab owned citrus groves packaging and storage facilities as well as that years crop looting the prosperous arab citrus groves and making them the arab owners destitute refugees
6391290 the indigenous arab population was recognized by paragraph 4 of article xxii of the league of nations covenant as a provisionally independent nation palestine was placed under a class a mandate the very status of which indicated that the indigenous population was well advanced toward self determination
6391291 there were 309 high government arab officials and 30 178 lower grade arab officials
6391292 we came to this country which was already populated by arabs and we are establishing a hebrew that is a jewish state here jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because these geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either there is not one place in this country that did not have a former arab population

6391318 using a four bit microcontroller i would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness from snow white to coal black the program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16 element table of initial timer values then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table at the end of the time delay it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast come back next week and ill show you a working prototype
6391319 toasters dont just turn bread into toast they are also used to warm frozen waffles what you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker as the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated they will demand more capabilities they will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage fry bacon and make scrambled eggs a toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete if we dont look to the future we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years
6391320 with this in mind we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem first create a class of breakfast foods specialize this class into subclasses grains pork and poultry the specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast muffins pancakes and waffles pork divided into sausage links and bacon and poultry divided into scrambled eggs hard boiled eggs poached eggs fried eggs and various omelet classes
6391321 the ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork dairy and poultry classes thus we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance at run time the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says cook yourself the semantics of this message depend of course on the kind of object so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs
6391322 reviewing the process so far we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food in the design phase we have discovered some derived requirements specifically we need an object oriented language with multiple inheritance of course users dont want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying so concurrent processing is required too
6391323 we must not forget the user interface the lever that lowers the food lacks versatility and the darkness knob is confusing users wont buy the product unless it has a user friendly graphical interface when the breakfast cooker is plugged in users should see a cowboy boot on the screen users click on it and the message booting unix v 8 3 appears on the screen unix 8 3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook
6391324 having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase an intel 80386 with 8mb of memory a 30mb hard disk and a vga monitor should be sufficient if you select a multitasking object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built in gui writing the program will be a snap imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware first design strategy to lock us into a four bit microcontroller

6391336 has held that the uk government is under a duty to disclose evidence which it holds about the treatment of binyam mohamed between his detention by pakistani authorities in april 2002 and his subsequent reappearance in bagram air base in july 2004
6391337 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6391338 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system
6391339 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6391340 i dont know what the common thread of that is but im going to tell you this were going to break whatever bad trend that weve had in the semifinals
6391341 just knowing kobe i know hes going to take this kind of personally
6391342 anybody who has aspirations to be a champion you understand that theres a sense of pride that comes along with beating a champion
6391343 it came down to the last shot of the semifinals which felt like it was the gold medal game
6391344 you kind of forgot that we played for the gold medal
6391345 weve played all the best teams in the tournament and were going to beat them all
6391346 were being humble of course but we need to be confident if were not confident we have no chance
6391347 i think the struggles been a great thing because were not coming into this underestimating anything
6391348 i think its been a blessing in disguise really because you get to the semifinals and you kind of focus on the gold medal game to be honest with you this time were not doing that
6391349 it has to be the case from the decline in numbers that some young people are focusing their efforts on fewer gcses that has been a trend that has been happening since 2003
6391350 of course we were all very nervous and all the team was thinking about what was happening in our country it was very difficult and very tough to concentrate on sport but i tried

6391447 guys who used to be chemical farmers tell me they have fewer problems with pests since they went organic
6391448 the biggest mistake made in conventional farming is over fertilizing which makes plants more susceptible to pests and diseases
6391449 more cell density leads to better resistance to pathogens it also leads to crunchier denser food
6391450 a conventional farm is a sterile environment with no beneficials
6391451 when farms become more stable ecologically you see a diversity of pest eating insects and birds and spiders theyre amazing predators and are heavily damaged by pesticides

6391561 look there are 7 million people in tajikistan half of them are men a million and a half out of 3 5 million are children another million tajiks are in russia only 1 million tajik men are left in tajikistan out of them only 225 000 attend friday prayers the rest are an absolutely useless bunch of people
6391562 their goal is to create antagonism in society and destroy unity among muslims
6391563 this idea that we at the u s embassy give money to religious groups is a crazy idea
6391564 its not true i can assure you but we do work with the tajik government to support freedom of conscience for all peaceful religious groups but no we dont give money to the salafi or other groups i also read the article in which someone said we support hizb ut tahrir and salafi in order to create divisions within the islamic world its nothing but propaganda
6391565 dangerous because it shows itself from its good side first and then gradually becomes dangerous
6391566 i heard that the tajik government after analyzing and studying this group and perhaps they have also got some information from other countries has ordered that this movement should not be supported and even it should be restricted
6391567 to some extent i support this idea although in my opinion not supporting the movement would be enough

6391617 the latest jcw model to be produced at minis plant oxford is a firecracker not only is it one of the quickest cars in its class its also one of the most environmentally friendly it outscores all its rivals for entertainment bringing the no frills thrills of the original to life in a thoroughly modern and brilliant package
6391618 reinventing a legend is never easy but that is exactly what fiat has achieved with its new 500
6391619 so what makes the fiat so special in a similar vein to the mini the 500 manages to capture the spirit of a legend without coming across as forced or tacky its low prices go hand in hand with the great looking exterior and interior styling to create an irresistible package
6391620 and the worst news for rivals is that this is only the beginning for the 500 there are technical innovations such as an ultra efficient two cylinder engine waiting in the wings while the abarth sporting brand will bring hot hatch performance to the fiat at the end of the year looking further ahead the italian firm will also launch an estate version to rival the mini clubman as well as a 500 convertible by keeping the style and spirit of the original but adding refinement versatility and luxury fiat has built a car that we will be talking about for decades to come just like its predecessor
6391621 this is yet another example of the fans the fiat 500 is winning among the uks leading commentators and journalists and i am delighted to say that that same confidence in the product is being shown by customers too
6391622 to date we have sold or taken orders for more than 11 000 fiat 500s in the uk and there are a lot more to come yet we are delighted with auto expresss choice of best city car for 2008 and look forward to many more important awards like this one for the 500

6391627 the achievement of tqs is seen as an important milestone in the quality improvement journey but not the destination the benefits arising from a clear focus on customer orientation and quality improvement are well understood by bmw consequently well continue to seek new opportunities to pursue these critical objectives

6391635 what she did was special i dont think thats a record that will ever be broken you can say they are the best ever at beach volleyball
6391636 this is just another reason why we play in bathing suits
6391637 i dreamt about rain last night it could have been 500 degrees or 500 below and wed be happy
6391638 the rain makes it better we felt like warriors out there
6391639 they are more experienced and stronger but we have made great strides for these olympic games this is the best that we could do
6391640 we looked at the clock and there was a long time left so we were going to have to defend for a long time
6391641 weve been resilient and we showed that against argentina as well weve figured out ways to make a block of eight and fight through that time its not always easy thats when we got let off the hook
6391642 i think he was by far their most direct attacker up the wing and i think he was having a lot of success getting behind us
6391643 it helped us a great deal when we brought damarcus beasley in
6391644 he did a very good job of working with heath pearce and helping to make that situation better
6391645 although probably everybody would assume that were the strong team of the group and everything else we havent won here in 20 years and theres a reason for that
6391646 it was a quick reminder for everybody tonight that these qualifiers are tough theyre hard games and it was a testament to the players efforts tonight and its a great result
6391647 it was not a game where i think our soccer was
6391648 it was a game where we relied much more on the effort of the team and the team spirit and that was the most important thing for us in a very hard game
6391649 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6391650 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6391651 raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6391652 the real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets it gets to the heart of their economic philosophies
6391653 both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in iraq
6391654 been law for eight years now and taxpayers are used to those rates
6391655 allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase
6391656 maksudku begini kau tidak akan mampu mengubah seluruh keadaan andai kau sekarang sudah mengalami pencapaian yang seperti ini itu artinya kau sudah cukup sukses terlalu berat jika ingin mengubah semua hal itu bukan tanggungjawabmu sendiri
6391657 dan kau kurang fokus artinya kau masih ragu mana prioritas yang akan kau capai mestinya ambil saja dua dua nya sekaligus nanti baru ketahuan kau akan lebih sukses dimana kalau cara biasa tidak bisa pakailah cara ekstrim
6391658 mengubah kebiasaan itu cukup gampang hanya diperlukan waktu maksimal 90 hari aku sudah membuktikan

6391666 its his hobby dont you remember that show and tell last year
6391667 vidtomp3 that can convert your online videos from youtube or any others to an mp3 file
6391668 there has not been that much criticism from the public i did hear a board member got an email that i should be fired i am sure jeff fisher gets emails like that every week
6391669 the year began with a lack of integrity surrounding the secret changing of fairview high to a trimester and ended with misrepresenting to all or some of the board the county commission the media and or the public concerning the handling of improper release of confidential information she told the public the media and the county commission that the individual who improperly disclosed confidential information resigned without pressure or being asked to in a written report to the board she said she threatened him with termination unless he resigned

6391674 this puts our caravan some seven years earlier than the current histories believe which makes it a very important piece of british motoring heritage
6391675 its had a little bit of modernisation over the years such as new wheels and axle from a 1930s austin and a more modern hitch but everything else is basically the same as it was when constructed
6391676 its very much like a garden shed on wheels and i can imagine it was very cosy in its day especially if you tried to fit more than one person inside it
6391677 by the second grade there was no statistically significant difference in educational performance attributable to pre k participation
6391678 its a tragedy that state government squandered hundreds of millions of tax dollars on a program that simply doesnt help children
6391679 hard lessons learned applying 40 years of government pre k to benefit tennessees children today
6391680 its unfortunate that gov bredesen and state lawmakers didnt heed our warning three years ago when we highlighted the problems associated with government pre k
6391681 but state leaders can redeem themselves by shuttering this ineffective program and empowering parents with educational options

6391689 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our energy security
6391690 i would guess that these leases are pretty well picked over

6391693 we think that this is a good document for the security council to pass and we are looking forward to a positive reaction by other members of the security council
6391694 to rubber stamp an russian interpretation that we do not agree with
6391695 i drove past at about half past four and there was nothing happening

6391714 a nybody who is doing appointments at schools would have to make sure that the person was able to implement its policies and all schools have to have an anti racism policy
6391715 we were aware of mr walkers political beliefs from day one theres no evidence that he used his time at teesdale school as a political platform weve been pleased with the teaching he has carried out for us he solved a very difficult position where we were struggling to staff particular courses and he has turned that around we have much to be grateful to him for

6391762 vai pois povo meu entra nos teus quartos e fecha as tuas portas sobre ti esconde te s por um momento at que passe a ira pois eis que o senhor sai do seu lugar para castigar a iniq idade dos moradores da terra a terra descobrir o sangue que embebeu e j n o encobrir aqueles que foram mortos
6391763 por isso em um s dia sobrevir o os seus flagelos
6391764 ent o ouvi vinda do templo uma grande voz que dizia aos sete anjos ide e derramai sobre a terra as sete ta as da ira de deus
6391765 o primeiro saiu e derramou a sua ta a sobre a terra e apareceu uma chaga feia e dolorosa nos homens que tinham o sinal da besta e que adoravam a sua imagem
6391766 e esta ser a praga com que o senhor ferir a todos os povos que guerrearam contra jerusal m a sua carne ser consumida estando eles de p e lhes apodrecer o os olhos nas suas rbitas e lhes apodrecer a l ngua na sua boca
6391767 n o te assustar s do terror noturno nem da peste que se propaga nas trevas caiam mil ao teu lado e dez mil tua direita tu n o ser s atingido nenhum mal te suceder praga nenhuma chegar tua tenda
6391768 o segundo anjo derramou a sua ta a no mar que se tornou em sangue como de um morto e morreram todos os seres viventes que estavam no mar
6391769 o terceiro anjo derramou a sua ta a nos rios e nas fontes das guas e se tornaram em sangue
6391770 ent o ouvi o anjo das guas dizer justo s tu senhor que s e que eras o santo porque julgaste estas coisas
6391771 porquanto derramaram o sangue de santos e de profetas tamb m tu lhes deste sangue a beber s o merecedores disto
6391772 e ouvi uma voz do altar responder na verdade senhor deus todo poderoso verdadeiros e justos s o os teus ju zos
6391773 os aflitos e necessitados buscam guas e n o as h e a sua l ngua se seca de sede mas eu o senhor os ouvirei eu o deus de israel n o os desampararei
6391774 o quarto anjo derramou a sua ta a sobre o sol e foi lhe permitido que abrasasse os homens com fogo
6391775 os homens foram abrasados com grande calor e blasfemaram contra o nome de deus que tem poder sobre estas pragas mas n o se arrependeram para lhe darem gl ria
6391776 o senhor quem te guarda o senhor a tua sombra tua direita de dia n o te molestar o sol nem de noite a lua
6391777 o quinto anjo derramou a sua ta a sobre o trono da besta e o seu reino se fez tenebroso os homens mordiam as suas l nguas de dor
6391778 e por causa das suas dores e por causa das suas chagas blasfemaram contra o deus do c u e n o se arrependeram das suas obras
6391779 o sexto anjo derramou a sua ta a sobre o grande rio eufrates e a sua gua secou se para que se preparasse o caminho dos reis do oriente
6391780 ent o vi tr s esp ritos imundos semelhantes a r s sa rem da boca do drag o da boca da besta e da boca do falso profeta
6391781 s o esp ritos de dem nios que operam sinais e v o ao encontro dos reis de todo o mundo a fim de congreg los para a batalha naquele grande dia do deus todo poderoso

6391784 s fiel at o fim e dar te ei a coroa da vida

6391848 i think that if you went in and could see whats going on in their minds though they may never say that stuff and im not saying theres some conspiracy or something like that but i think the thing is they realise that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer
6391849 i think that just based on their actions what they say is one thing but what they do is another
6391850 when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is elicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit
6391851 you can make philosophical arguments that are difficult to debate but at the same time youre just sort of ignoring the enormity of the problem
6391852 if you understood anything of that you most likely have a masters degree in geologics and thus might have a use of this tool but if youre like me snowed in swede you didnt get any of that
6391853 surely youve got enough on your plate with all the current goings on to have more important things to do than idle the day away on yahoo answers
6391854 it appears that google is embracing the walled garden approach of salesforce com and microsoft instead of the cloud approach of amazon
6391855 i strongly believe that in the future most if not all server side software applications will be deployed in a cloud computing like manner
6391856 there need to be tools available that enable a developer to build and deploy an application without having to download anything to their desktop
6391857 googles app engine see app engine grid computing deployment tools for cloud computing
6391858 by markus klems telling of a report in which the authors identify 10 companies 2 unconventional plays with exposure to cloud computing growth the companies
6391859 they seem to think that during periods of lower economic activity it gives them a rare opportunity to establish themselves in new areas of emerging technology that may give them a competitive advantage down the road
6391860 he didnt make a big deal about the awards and medals
6391861 we were in a different school every year it was always an adventure
6391862 sound like it was one of the greatest places to be on the planet
6391863 what he enjoyed the most was running his own company
6391864 the freedom to do things the way he wanted to
6391865 hes going to leave a big gaping hole i think for a long time
6391866 im a little biased but he was the best dad ive ever known i try to be as much like him but those were big shoes to fill
6391867 no coffee no hot food no slicers this is crazy
6391868 tell me the truth are you taking out a girl
6391869 if dad were here he would say we should have charged admission at the door
6391870 i figure a 3 million loss to pears this year
6391871 this is the worst impasse ive seen since ive been here
6391872 were not much closer than we were from day 1
6391873 we probably need to lock everyone in the room and not let anyone out
6391874 a large part of why were in such a budget mess now
6391875 staying hard and fast to the rule of no more borrowing
6391876 in the assembly thats not easy because both sides have been very polarized
6391877 i keep telling locals and groups to push the governor to lead he isnt doing that but he should
6391878 its not how much money we have its how we spend it
6391879 the rest of it was just kind of petty stuff
6391880 but the surfboard was a big item and the two 100 gift cards then he just got munchies at longs i think
6391881 if she stays here it will create a very dangerous precedent for other kids
6391882 what family would send their child abroad if maybe they would not come back
6391883 we all kind of imagined we had tanya with us for another year and then we learned that we wouldnt and she was crying for hours that sparked more serious thought
6391884 our purpose was to have her here physically to apply for another visa a student visa a work visa
6391885 we didnt even know you had to go to belarus and come back to do that we just assumed we were getting an extension
6391886 she has continuously experienced violent abuse and drug use by persons present in the household
6391887 maybe some people will understand some nice people who have nice heart
6391888 this place reminds me of a city its so big im really excited
6391889 but we are just kind of walking on air this is just a miracle
6391890 in the end there is some inconvenience some additional expense but we think there is some benefit to students coming back and not seeing a beautiful complete building
6391891 last time i was here there was just frames of buildings its so exciting all this new stuff
6391892 the united states of america will continue to support georgias democracy
6391893 our military will continue to provide needed humanitarian aid to the georgia people
6391894 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6391895 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6391896 i hope someday you can forgive yourself because i cant
6391897 i dont believe you have sympathy for those you killed
6391898 if there was a sentence known as forever in state prison i would give it to you
6391899 i didnt mean to do this a lot of innocent people died i dont deserve to live i apologize for everything please pray for me please
6391900 its clear to me that if the plaintiff jacob was denied this relief he would suffer irreparable harm
6391901 they had a special relationship that this court considers more than typical
6391902 in fact on the very night mrs gunvalson and her son were staying at the home of a ptc employee another patients parent was staying with her as well
6391903 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6391904 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6391905 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current clinical trials in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124
6391906 its clear that hes getting weaker as it goes on
6391907 weve had reports of people having 3 to 5 feet of water in their home
6391908 i had no idea what it looked like out there until today
6391909 i didnt think it was going to be that deep
6391910 it pretty much came up to my ears and chin i saw this little kid coming toward me so i grabbed him and swam him back to the shore line and went back for other two guys that were still stuck in there
6391911 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial there are other areas of the state getting 10 12 inches that have crops in the ground and are getting too much
6391912 john mccain lets face it hes got a compelling biography hes a p o w
6391913 let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6391914 sen obama has made it clear that he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight
6391915 but when i bring our troops home they will come home with honor and victory leaving iraq secured as a democratic ally in the arab heartland
6391916 today we reached the height of hypocrisy when john mccain questioned sen obamas record
6391917 sen mccain cheered president bushs decision to take our eye off the ball and start a war that had nothing to do with 9 11
6391918 is one of the least experienced candidates in the last hundred years if not the least experienced
6391919 diplomatically and politically and with negotiations and with economic pressure
6391920 i think john mccain has the experience thats needed for our safety
6391921 dont spend a lot of time defending their record because they cant theyre not going to argue the issues
6391922 you can tell the history of the environment from whats in the water
6391923 the magnitude and frequency of floodings may increase because springtime flooding is usually caused by rain on snow
6391924 but thats a long way down the road we have a lot to learn in the interim
6391925 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
6391926 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
6391927 as you get older the vaccine becomes less cost effective
6391928 im very concerned we have to make sure hes protected from having those psychotic symptoms again
6391929 if it had to be done again i would do it
6391930 it was the closest thing to hell that i have seen
6391931 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6391932 youth online have a lot of socio political energy and word of mouth impact
6391933 so we really needed to get the video to key social locations on the web where it couldnt be overlooked feed company understood this and delivered the expected reach and engagement
6391934 no doubt that mendis performance in the on going india sri lanka series is very good but media has highlighted him a bit too prominently it is too early to say if he will continue to perform like this for long
6391935 so far mendis has done extraordinary well and launched his cricket carrier in a marvellous way but indian batsmen are capable enough to tackle his bowling
6391936 it is shockingly insensitive that a man who had spoken in such a manner about a minor girl has been reinstated at his position
6391937 i will write a letter to the uttar pradesh chief minister asking her to remove him from the post
6391938 i am quite relieved that the high court has taken a strict view in the matter and i hope that the system will improve with the verdict
6391939 this is utter despair because i am also a part of this system so i feel ashamed
6391940 no punishment is good enough but what can you do
6391941 in a way the sentence is much lighter than expected because there was blatant attempt at interference in administration of justice
6391942 it is a fairly detailed judgement passed after months and months of hearing and nobody can complain as all aspects have been taken into consideration
6391943 there is a clear message a very clear signal to the members of the bar that not only should every member practice what is supposed to have originated as a noble profession but particularly the senior members of the bar in that category have to be like caesar and caesars wife even above the normal standards
6391944 in my opinion it could have been even stronger infact they should have sent him to jail because there was clear evidence for sure
6391945 ive achieved what i came here for and none can take it away that surely takes the pressure off my shoulders and ill be in a free state of mind tomorrow
6391946 but that does not mean ill just go through the motions tomorrow it will be the same vigour and the intensity too would remain same im going for the gold
6391947 although i didnt realise it at the time having a stroke was the biggest blessing in disguise i ever could have wished for
6391948 i have amazed myself by the turnaround to be honest but im loving every minute of it now i wouldnt change my life for anything
6391949 my doctor told me following a stroke your brain usually rewires itself to avoid the damaged bits and often leads to discovering hidden talents
6391950 we had immediately informed the news channels to run scrolls once the decision was made and carried out public announcement at the station the passengers however could not hear any of our pleas
6391951 yellow heads which he painted in 1979 was showcased along with steal 2 an oil on canvas measuring 167 8cm x 228 5 cm by multimedia specialist subodh gupta as part of the 20 exclusive art works displayed at a select preview in the capital
6391952 the works by over 80 artists are expected to raise between usd 10 million to 14 million
6391953 two dimensions comprising a collage of miniature snapshots of lahores urban landscape is estimated to fetch between 3
6391954 rana is among the eight artists from pakistan whose works will be auctioned on september 16
6391955 to be honest this was a below par show by rajiv of course mocco was superior of the two but i still feel rajiv could have done better we did not expect him to win but rajiv did not try enough
6391956 moccos defence was quite shaky but rajiv did not attack him i told him to go on the offence but he did not heed to my advice
6391957 tactically speaking rajiv did not have a chance against him
6391958 no it wont happen to me it may happen to someone else but it wont happen to me
6391959 how i wish i have bought that health insurance policy how i wished id looked into health insurance sooner
6391960 whats in it for me if i talk like this what do i get out of this
6391961 lets wait and see what happens who knows what this could be
6391962 the reason most people are so miserable is that they cant stand themselves
6391963 over in the wps op ed page david ignatius tells of his one on one interview with president bush where the two talked about iran
6391964 in his column charles krauthammer analyzes one of bushs public statements which leads him to state the signal is unmistakable
6391965 sen barack obama d il makes his iowa debut at sen tom harkins d ia steak fry in west indianola ia tongues are wagging over news that the freshman senator will be accompanied by steve hildebrand the democratic strategist who managed then vice president gores 2000 win in the iowa caucuses against former sen bill bradley d nj

6391989 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
6391990 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs
6391991 in an even more dire situation than the active army but both have the same symptoms i just have a higher fever

6392015 baloubet era mais genial como animal mas com uma certa dificuldade poderia apresentar um pouco de problema rufus de segunda a domingo o mesmo cavalo
6392016 rufus um cavalo cl ssico com temperamento padr o bem adestrado obediente calmo vamos dizer um cavalo mais para o ordin rio um cavalo comum com as qualidades necess rias de respeito e pot ncia o baloubet era mais genial temperamental inteiro com todas as dificuldades que um cavalo inteiro mostra um verdadeiro macho garanh o
6392017 isso dava sempre uma certa expectativa na performance dele como o que fez em sydney com rufus normalmente jamais passar uma coisa dessas e isso deixa o cavaleiro muito calmo abordando a aproxima o da pista
6392018 todos os cavalos s o diferentes este um cavalo que tem menos for a menos pot ncia naturalmente mas tem outras qualidades tamb m um cavalo que n o olha nada superfranco imposs vel de ele dar uma parada ou algo assim
6392019 antes do come o da prova o rodrigo n o era apontado como o grande candidato mas ele mostrou que seu cavalo se desenvolveu de forma precisa para chegar aqui em excelente forma havia uns dez cavalos mais favoritos que o dele no torneio
6392020 ele caiu no ranking e n o se classificou para a final do global champions tour por causa disso
6392021 isso deu ainda mais confian a a eles pessoa e rufus e este cavalo tem gabarito para substituir o baloubet

6392083 television trade is big business for the uks dynamic creative sector and im pleased weve consolidated our global position second only to the us in overall television export sales
6392084 the uk is also becoming more successful in cracking the us market over the past five years there has been a massive 90 increase in international coproduction compared to a 22 increase worldwide
6392085 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
6392086 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
6392087 we are compelled to respond tomorrow if he does not do it again we will not talk about it again
6392088 im very disappointed and race will not have any role in my campaign nor is there any place for it im disappointed that hes used race
6392089 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
6392090 so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
6392091 n m vi alle st sammen og komme med felles l sninger p de store utfordringer vi n st r overfor

6392093 heres something for the mccain campaign to remember democracies dont always elect the man who has done the most for his country
6392094 today russian political circles are creating an organzational basis for a revenge of political forces and ideas that lost four years ago
6392095 problem issues of teaching common ukrainian russian history in educational establishments
6392096 i was a constitutional law professor which means unlike the current president i actually respect the constitution obama told an audience at a campaign fundraiser
6392097 several direct mail pieces issued for obamas primary senate campaign said he was a law professor at the university of chicago he is not he is a senior lecturer now on leave at the school in academia there is a vast difference between the two titles details matter
6392098 because some folks were willing to march across a bridge so they got together and barack obama jr was born so dont tell me i dont have a claim on selma alabama
6392099 earlier in the day at a prayer breakfast the illinois democrat said if it hadnt been for selma i wouldnt be here
6392100 barack obama was born in hawaii on august 4th 1961
6392101 obama has claimed on numerous occasions to have become fluent in indonesian in six months yet those who knew him disputed that during recent interviews israella pareira darmawan obamas 1st grade teacher said she attempted to help him learn the indonesian language by going over pronunciation and vowel sounds he struggled greatly with the foreign language she said and with his studies as a result
6392102 obama said at some point in fall 2005 he got a stockholder letter he said he believes it was from avi or skyterra but he couldnt remember which company
6392103 the origin of the shareholder update obama referred to remains unclear skyterra like many public companies sends investors copies of its securities and exchange commission sec proxy forms also known as 14as but none were issued during the fall of 2005 according to sec records
6392104 it doesnt sound like anything we would have sent out
6392105 avi generally sends mailings to shareholders or institutional investors that proactively request them or sign up for e mail lists said michael hubbard avis investor relations director it doesnt sound like anything we would have sent out hubbard said
6392106 thursday obama said of de vellis that his campaign had no way of knowing who this person was if i have a phone contract with verizon and an employee of a phone company does something that you know were not responsible for that obama said
6392107 obamas campaign says it had no role in creating or posting the ad but wednesday democratic operative philip de vellis took credit for the ad it turned out that he worked for blue state digital a computer firm that is among obamas consultants
6392108 blue state helped design obamas web site and one of the firms founding members joe rospars took a leave from the company to work as obamas director of new media
6392109 on thursday an earlier e mail surfaced in which de vellis boasted to numerous people about his role in the creation of a web page my barackobama com a site designed by blue state digital
6392110 the press secretary for sen barack obama d ill recently lived with the creator of the scathingly satirical youtube video ad that attacked sen hillary clinton d n y a revelation that seems to undermine the senators claim that he and his campaign had only very attenuated ties with the ads creator
6392111 but its not something that we had anything to do with or were aware of and that frankly given what it looks like we dont have the technical capacity to create something like that
6392112 i made the ad on a sunday afternoon in my apartment using my personal equipment a mac and some software uploaded it to youtube and sent links around to blogs
6392113 according to the obama campaign obamas punahou classmate keith kakugawa explicitly raised the possibility that he could make up false stories about obama implying he would do so if the campaign did not give him money
6392114 that allegation infuriated kakugawa prompting him to speak to the tribune after repeatedly refusing to do so
6392115 kakugawa wouldnt discuss his school days with obama other than to say he considered the senator a brother and wouldnt do a damn thing to ever hurt his campaign
6392116 unfairly omits others responsible for the successes of the asbestos campaign
6392117 and though most memoirs place their authors at the center of events critics of dreams from my father say the book unfairly omits others responsible for the successes of the asbestos campaign an event that obama portrays as central to his maturation as a political leader
6392118 obama did not play the singular role in the asbestos episode
6392119 they say obama did not play the singular role in the asbestos episode that he portrays in the best selling memoir dreams from my father a story of race and inheritance credit for pushing officials to deal with the cancer causing substance according to interviews and news accounts from that period also goes to a well known preexisting group at altgeld gardens and to a local newspaper called the chicago reporter obama does not mention either one in his book
6392120 in his best selling autobiography dreams from my father obama describes having heated conversations about racism with another black student ray the real ray keith kakugawa said he does recall long soulful talks with the young obama and that his friend confided his longing and loneliness but those talks kakugawa said were not about race not even close
6392121 the handful of black students who attended punahou school in hawaii for instance say they struggled mightily with issues of race and racism there but absent from those discussions they say was another student then known as barry obama
6392122 then theres the copy of life magazine that obama presents as his racial awakening at age 9 in it he wrote was an article and two accompanying photographs of an african american man physically and mentally scarred by his efforts to lighten his skin in fact the life article and the photographs dont exist say the magazines own historians
6392123 when asked about the discrepancy obama said in a recent interview it might have been an ebony or it might have been
6392124 but that ad diminishes him and makes him look silly
6392125 u s sen barack obama evidently cared more about criticism back home than visiting wounded american soldiers in germany
6392126 r ather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been considered a political controversy of some sort what we decided was that we not make a visit and instead i would call some of the troops that were there

6392132 senator both you and senator clinton have said senator mccain favors 100 more years of war in iraq sunday in the new york times frank rich wrote really barack obama and hillary clinton should be ashamed of themselves for libeling john mccain he felt that the american troops should be a long term presence the way they were in japan and south korea are you willing to admit that youve distorted his statements
6392133 no thats not accurate we can pull up the quotes on you tube
6392134 senator obama hasnt said that senator mccain said we would be at war for 100 years
6392135 mccain wants to continue this war in iraq maybe for another 100 years
6392136 and when it comes to foreign policy john mccain says he wants to fight a hundred year war a hundred years he says as long as it takes
6392137 w e are bogged down in a war that john mccain now suggests might go on for another 100 years
6392138 sen mccain says that he is willing to send our troops into another 100 years of war in iraq
6392139 really barack obama and hillary clinton should be ashamed of themselves for libeling john mccain
6392140 really barack obama and hillary clinton should be ashamed of themselves for libeling john mccain as a growing chorus reiterates their refrains that mr mccain is willing to send our troops into another 100 years of war in iraq as mr obama said or willing to keep this war going for 100 years per mrs clinton are flat out wrong what mr mccain actually said in a new hampshire town hall meeting was that he could imagine a 100 year long american role in iraq like our long term presence in south korea and japan where americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed see for yourself on youtube
6392141 l ately barack obama in particular has stepped up his attacks on mccains 100 years notion but in doing so obama is seriously misleading voters if not outright lying to them about exactly what mccain said
6392142 it is not even remotely true and they know it
6392143 you might have heard from the new hampshire democratic party and democratic presidential candidates that sen john mccain wants 100 more years of war in iraq it is not even remotely true and they know it
6392144 but the timetables flippantly tossed out have been condensed into sound bites by his democratic opponents turned into fund raising appeals and mashed into youtube parodies many of the sound bites mischaracterize and distort what was said in mr mccains six minute exchange on jan 3
6392145 d emocrats imply that mccain wants to keep us troops in iraq for 100 years under the same conditions theyre fighting right now which is simply not what mccain said mccain explicitly said that us presence in iraq long term would be predicated on the absence of violence and on the establishment of stability in the region
6392146 sen mccain and the democrats vying to run against him in the fall are engaged in a debate of sorts over how long u s troops should stay in iraq and under what circumstances thats a genuine point of contention but hillary rodham clinton and especially barack obama have distilled mccains position into sound bite oversimplifications suggesting he foresees a war without end in anyones lifetime
6392147 m ccain has never said he wants war and never advocated 100 more years of war making in iraq in january he indicated at a new hampshire town hall meeting that maintaining a postwar presence in iraq would be fine
6392148 sen mccains offhand comment about keeping u s troops in iraq for 100 years has been distorted he said that meant as long as troops werent getting killed or wounded
6392149 5 years after shock and awe a shallow debate on iraq
6392150 well the charge that mccain wants to carry on the war for 100 years is a total canard what mccain said was yes we could stay in iraq for 100 years on the same basis we have been in korea ever since the end of the korean war or germany ever since the end of the second world war as long as our troops arent being shot and it seems perfectly reasonable and so they sens clinton and obama are mischaracterizing what he said badly
6392151 but a serious argument is not what democrats are seeking
6392152 as lenin is said to have said a lie told often enough becomes truth and as this lie passes into truth the democrats are ready to deploy it
6392153 the charge that john mccain wants to wage a 100 year war in iraq has become a recurring theme of the obama campaign the candidate has made the claim several times on the campaign trail as has susan rice one of his top foreign policy advisers mccain has never talked about wanting a 100 year war in iraq
6392154 leftists claim the comments mean mccain supports a century of combat their hyperventilating criticism suggests they either did not read his words or deliberately are distorting them
6392155 hillary clinton and barack obama have suggested that this means mccain wants to fight a 100 year war in obamas words this is so obvious a distortion that it must backfire against democrats over time especially if they nominate barack obama who has so loudly advertised his commitment to civil discourse
6392156 havent we been listening to talk of 100 years of war in iraq for 100 years now it certainly feels that way but this favorite talking point of the two democrats presidential candidates is bogus
6392157 in context mccains statements seem clear he doesnt want the war to continue for 100 years but hes willing to keep a few brigades there as long as theyre not getting killed f or obama and others to paint mccains stance as a war without end doesnt quite hold up
6392158 the dncs message portrays mccain as bent on fighting an endless war in iraq dnc we cant afford four more years with a president who fights an endless war in iraq on the war mccain scoffed at bushs call to leave troops in iraq for 50 years saying make it a hundred that of course is a serious distortion of what mccain actually said to a town hall meeting in new hampshire back on jan 3 theres little doubt that mccain is less eager than either clinton or obama to bring troops home without further suppression of insurgent attacks but its a rank falsehood for the dnc to accuse mccain of wanting to wage endless war based on his support for a presence in iraq something like the u s role in south korea
6392159 obama twisted mccains words in the cleveland debate he said we are bogged down in a war that john mccain now suggests might go on for another 100 years as we explain above mccain was referring to a peacetime presence not the war so we find obamas statement false
6392160 its really a distortion of what mccain said mccain was talking about a peace time presence in iraq that would continue he even said as long as 1 000 years not a war that would last that long and so the line that obama and some other critics of the war have been using is really not an accurate description of what mccain said

6392167 the unfolding tragedy in tibet should draw the attention of the entire world i deplore the violent crackdown by chinese authorities and the continuing oppression in tibet of those merely wishing to practice their faith and preserve their culture and heritage i have listened carefully to the dalai lama and am convinced he is a man of peace who reflects the hopes and aspirations of tibetans i urge the government of the peoples republic of china to address the root causes of unrest in tibet by opening a genuine dialogue with his holiness the dalai lama reports of shutting down youtube and confiscation of sim cards are disturbing and reports of multiple deaths are far more so especially in a year when china is preparing to host the olympic games i urge the chinese authorities to ensure peaceful protest is not met with violence to release monks and others detained for peacefully expressing their views and to allow full outside access to tibet
6392168 weve been in germany for 60 years but the point is if we can reduce and eliminate american casualties then americans will be satisfied with an american presence here
6392169 weve come a long way in five years and its been well worth the effort
6392170 our analysis was that the americans were going to make the mistake sooner or later to invade iraq
6392171 and that this invasion will lead to the fall of the regime and that we should play an important role in the confrontation and resistance
6392172 i just think what that means if al qaida wins they tell the world that their dedication is to follow us home

6392181 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6392182 normally if you notice then you will find one thing whenever state bank of india sbi falls something like say 7 or 6 on a particular day the very next day you dont get much of a downswing there of course if situation warrants and the inflation figure is so bad people take it very badly then maybe there will be more fall but otherwise i would be more comfortable going fresh short in sbi something like rs 1 375 1 380 kind of range because a number of moving averages say 14 day moving averages are all located above rs 1 400
6392183 if one stretch a bit too far from the moving averages chances of a pullback remains so banking stocks have fallen considerably today so i would not like to initiate short position out there
6392184 but the stock that i feel actually might crack is the bellwether reliance industries if it were to fall below rs 2 190 then it would be an occasion to open fresh short position out there my feeling is that before this clearing probably it is going to hit rs 2 120 so that would be the space where i might actually open a short position

6392255 and free meals for life for anyone who ever knew fredy
6392256 if we are not willing to provide the troops necessary for victory however victory itself will be impossible
6392257 john recognized early on that more troops would be needed in order to achieve the security necessary for the iraqis to make the political progress were seeing now
6392258 he supported that action even though many said it would hurt his campaign for president he didnt care about popularity he cared about success for our troops and our country and now that the surge has worked it proves that johns judgment was correct
6392259 we need to tell the american people and i think theyll support it
6392260 we lost in vietnam because we lost the will to fight because we did not understand the nature of the war we were fighting and because we limited the tools at our disposal
6392261 without john mccain there would never have been the surge
6392262 difficult work to do in iraq we are bringing order to parts of that country that remain dangerous
6392263 theres no doubt in my mind that we will prevail and theres no doubt in my mind once these people are gone that we will be welcomed as liberators
6392264 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives
6392265 why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier the major conflict is over
6392266 he gets up and starts speaking looks at senator mccain and says you know im a british citizen i dont pay taxes in america and i will never vote for you and i will probably never see you again but heres what i think we dont have it right we dont have enough people i dont have the right kind of people
6392267 that british colonel opened our eyes beyond anything else you can be briefed in washington they can show you charts but when you get on the ground and actually talk to the people its a completely different story
6392268 and said youre going to have to start shooting some of these looters
6392269 i think theres a danger that unless we do whats necessary quickly that we could find ourselves in an extremely and i emphasize extremely difficult situation
6392270 the simple truth is that we do not have sufficient forces in iraq to meet our military objectives
6392271 simply put there does not appear to be a strategy behind our current force levels in iraq other than to preserve the illusion that we have sufficient forces in place to meet our objectives
6392272 if a militia or an internal conflict of some nature were to erupt
6392273 that would be a challenge out there that i do not have sufficient forces for
6392274 i hope that secretary rumsfeld would recognize that the realities on the ground and the realities on the ground are that things are not getting better however you do it i think we need more people there
6392275 he told secretary rumsfeld there was danger that the peace was being lost and asked that they ramp up both the troop strength and the civilian assistance programs
6392276 made a very passionate case that we need to look at adding more troops
6392277 in that first visit to iraq in august it was very subtle as to what was going on and it wasnt obvious to everybody that the country was going into chaos but john could see that the dynamics were all wrong
6392278 mccain believed the pentagon was spending too much time on search and destroy missions that were ineffective when in fact the troops needed to focus on the growing threats to civilians targeted by the insurgency creating a chaos that could destabilize the entire country
6392279 rumsfeld responded by assuring senator mccain that the commanders had told him they had all the assets they needed on the ground
6392280 in november 2003 secretary rumsfeld and senator mccain had one of a number of conversations that ended with the two in agreement on the need to win in iraq
6392281 senator mccain may prefer to characterize their meeting as a showdown at the ok corral but thats not straight talk its a fairy tale
6392282 i had breakfast with senator mccain he said the answer may not be more troops in iraq but the answer is not the status quo i agree with him
6392283 republicans embraced the idea well this violence is basically manufactured by the media its not as bad as it looks
6392284 democrats were so over the top this is hopeless and we cant win so johns voice which was consistent was drowned in the raucous clamor of partisan politics
6392285 the most serious american defeat on the global stage since vietnam
6392286 its not up to the commanders on the ground its up to the leadership of the country to make these decisions
6392287 thats why we elect them and have civilian supremacy were now facing a terrible insurgency
6392288 ive thought that for a long time election or no election
6392289 i have strenuously argued for larger troop numbers in iraq including the right kind of troops linguists special forces civil affairs and so forth
6392290 it will take time probably years and mean more american casualties to win in iraq
6392291 you know ive always said that we needed more troops over there i have said that for years
6392292 given the deteriorating situation it is clear at this point that we cannot through putting in more troops or maintaining the presence that we have expect that somehow the situation is going to improve and we have to do something significant to break the pattern that weve been in right now
6392293 general casey will make the decision as to how many troops we have there
6392294 the irony of ironies in my opinion is that if the republicans had not lost in 2006 the house and the senate
6392295 i doubt secretary rumsfeld would have ever been replaced and when he left it gave an opening to a new idea
6392296 they thought iraq was the death blow to the republican party
6392297 so you had a group of different republicans coming up with different plans that had the same result we would begin to end combat operations and pull out
6392298 i think johns finest moment and in many ways mine and senator liebermans was to stop the stampede of republicans who wanted to find ways out of iraq
6392299 there were a lot of late night phone calls where general petraeus and i talked
6392300 and then id be relaying everything to john who was on the campaign trail
6392301 while theres no doubt that a number of changes in policy are necessary i believe that none will be successful without an increase in the number of u s forces there
6392302 only the presence of additional coalition forces will give the iraqi government the opportunity to restore its authority and install the government
6392303 surging five additional brigades into baghdad by march tasking them with traditional counterinsurgency activity including protection of the population and intensive reconstruction would give the coalition in concert with iraqi security forces a real chance to succeed in its mission the surge shouldnt be limited by an artificial timeline
6392304 i believe success in iraq is still possible and that by finally bringing security to baghdad and by reducing the violence plaguing other areas we can give iraqis the best possible opportunity to construct a stable and self governing state our national security compels us to try and to try immediately
6392305 i do expect to give a report to the president on what ive learned and my perceptions
6392306 its always been my view that a heavy and sustained american military presence was not going to solve the problems in iraq
6392307 now is the time for bold and decisive leadership to chart a new course forward in iraq
6392308 some of the necessary changes including new leadership in both the civilian and military leadership have already been made we also strongly encourage you to send additional american troops to iraq to improve the security situation on the ground for far too long we have not had enough troops in iraq to provide security it is time to correct this mistake
6392309 it is clear that we need to change our strategy in iraq
6392310 our past efforts to secure baghdad failed for two principal reasons there were not enough iraqi and american troops to secure neighborhoods that had been cleared of terrorists and insurgents and there were too many restrictions on the troops we did have
6392311 it was also the day you realized you just helped to expand this war
6392312 i believe that this war is lost and this surge is not accomplishing anything
6392313 it seems to me senator reid has lost all sense of priority
6392314 he replaced a lost republican vote he gave us the vote that we needed on many occasions to avoid pulling the plug on iraq
6392315 in the words of chairman mao its always darkest before its totally black
6392316 i know its not possible for even the most grateful nation to compensate you in kind for the measure of devotion that you have with great personal sacrifice given our country
6392317 we have incurred a debt to you that we can never repay in full we can offer you only the small tribute of our humility
6392318 as you know the war in which you have fought has divided the american people but it has divided no americans in their admiration for you we all honor you
6392319 i have had the good fortune of knowing personally a great many brave and selfless patriots who sacrificed and shed blood to defend their country but ive known none braver nor better than you you are my inspiration and your countrys
6392320 it was just john and myself in the plane with a few staff folks
6392321 i never will forget as we took off he looked over at me and said if these kids can do this we can get our campaign back going it rededicated him to winning the primary
6392322 this campaign is going to be won on the ground vote by vote
6392323 and im convinced that if every voter learns of my unparalleled experience we will win
6392324 the military objectives of the surge are in large measure being met in recent months in the face of tough enemies in the brutal summer heat of iraq coalition and iraqi security forces have achieved progress in the security arena
6392325 the level of security incidents has decreased significantly since the start of the surge of offensive operations in mid june
6392326 based on all this and on the further progress we believe we can achieve over the next few months i believe that we will be able to reduce our forces to the pre surge level of brigade combat teams by next summer without jeopardizing the security gains that we have fought so hard to achieve
6392327 i think the surge has had some impact as i suggested
6392328 i would argue that the impact has been relatively modest given the investment
6392329 gen petraeus its astonishing the number of things that people come up with but one of the latest statements is that the surge had nothing to do with anbar province and the rather stunning success weve had there how do you respond to that
6392330 the success in anbar province is a political success but it is a political success that has been enabled very much by our forces who have been enabled by having additional forces
6392331 it would not have happened as quickly without the surge and i dont know whether we could have capitalized on it the way that we have without the surge
6392332 petraeus comes back crocker comes back in september and they knock it out of the park were in the ballgame now
6392333 after we had the meltdown and went from a national campaign of 30 states down to two or three that put a lot more emphasis on new hampshire
6392334 if the only time you had been to iraq was in january 2006 and youre thinking about running for president as a democrat you heard what you wanted to hear
6392335 he saw what he wanted to see he came back and declared the war lost
6392336 you raised a lot of eyebrows on this trip saying even knowing what you know now you still would not have supported the surge
6392337 katie as youve asked me three different times and i have said repeatedly that there is no doubt that our troops helped to reduce violence theres no doubt
6392338 but yet youre saying given what you know now you still wouldnt support it so im just trying to understand this i really dont mean to belabor this senator because im really im trying to figure out your position do you think the level of security in iraq would exist today without the surge
6392339 katie i have no idea what would have happened had we applied my approach which was to put more pressure on the iraqis to arrive at a political reconciliation so this is all hypotheticals what i can say is that theres no doubt that our u s troops have contributed to a reduction of violence in iraq
6392340 senator obama has indicated by his failure to acknowledge the success of the surge that he would rather lose a war than lose a campaign
6392341 senator obama does not understand the challenges we face and he did not understand the need for the surge and the fact that he did not understand that and still denies that it has succeeded i think the american people will make a judgement

6392459 nothing remains that looks like a plane its horrific everythings burned its a horror i dont want to tell you its the most like hell ive ever seen
6392460 the scene is devastating said pablo albella an emergency rescue worker
6392461 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6392462 the problem was that after the plane crashed the area around it was engulfed in flames the firefighters could not get to the plane
6392463 that is why the helicopters came with their water tanks they were putting out the fire
6392464 from my seat i could see smoke coming up from the end of the runway there was a small mushroom cloud as you might expect after an explosion
6392465 when we came in to land the emergency services were alongside our plane as we slowed they overtook us and went straight to the crash scene they were at the scene within two minutes there must have been about 80 or 90 ambulances
6392466 i could see flames coming from the tail end of the plane it looked like the left wing was broken and the aircraft was lying on its side
6392467 the plane was set to take off it was late on the second take off attempt there was fire in the motor of the plane

6392480 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
6392481 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage

6392488 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6392953 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6392954 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system
6392955 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6392956 we listened to feedback from gamers and weve introduced a new gameplay mechanic that allows virtual drive bys to be possible for the first time in a game
6392957 cruise control makes driving and shooting out the side window easier you can set the speed of the vehicle and then adjust the speed faster or slower on the fly with the gas pedal now drive bys are fun to do weve added a whole activity around doing drive bys on rival gang members
6392958 combat was cited as one of the strengths of the original game that over the top craziness has been upped a notch with the introduction of human shields which can be used to absorb bullets and then discarded like yesterdays trash

6392982 as the new executive director of this previously all volunteer organization i was thrown into the meeting planning industry by necessity

6392987 we are currently full at all three of our cemeteries we need more land
6392988 i would be happy if we could get an extra four acres
6392989 this is very time constraint we still have to meet with the prosecutor and the auditor to get all of the paperwork in order
6392990 sometimes we have to contract out to have the lawn mowed and that usually costs us 430

6393011 we need to go after the little people out selling drugs to our children
6393012 in the future we will put more resources into the training and mentoring of the afghan army
6393013 there are now 60 000 in the afghan army i believe the figures will go up from 60 000 to 80 000 and then 120 000
6393014 i believe that in time the figure for the afghan army given the size of this country may need to be even higher than 120 000
6393015 we emphasized the importance of better co operation between the two countries particularly in dealing with the insurgents that are coming across the border from pakistan to afghanistan
6393016 pakistan and the problem of terrorism there and coming from there is something that has to be raised with the pakistani government and i will continue to do so
6393017 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption so that we deal with the problem of narcotics
6393018 the governor will discuss the logistic cooperation with the chinese company especially the security side
6393019 we need to come to the table in september at the senior official level to test the seriousness of going forward to bring forward new ideas to overcome some of the problems that we encountered in july that we were not able to overcome at that time and quite frankly to stop the deterioration and the erosion of what was on the table in july

6393022 in all three cases the ioc has refused the requests to fly the flags at half mast we explained our case and debated it but the decision is irrevocable
6393023 with 204 countries and territories many occasions arise during the olympic games where athletes understandably would like to a make a public show of respect
6393024 the ioc is sympathetic to such needs and requests but maintains the position that public displays and demonstrations should be discouraged within olympic venues in order to enable a level playing field for all
6393025 we do encourage national olympic committees and their teams in these situations such as the recent tragic aviation accident in spain to find ways for athletes to cope with their grief
6393026 of course we were all very nervous and all the team was thinking about what was happening in our country georgia it was very difficult and very tough to concentrate on sport but i tried
6393027 anything can happen in this kind of match but i wish him all the best and good health

6393071 once this is over i think prices could go up a bit again
6393072 given the wider context of a general economic slowdown we should expect to see an impact on steel demand
6393073 distributors of steel products may prefer to keep relatively lean inventories while they wait to gain a better understanding of what demand will be in coming months
6393074 as the global economy is moderating steel producers are going to have to modify their expectations of further price rises
6393075 the market looks quite ugly over the next month or so
6393076 but then wed expect a bounce back because we still dont see enough steel supply to meet demand
6393077 theres not enough steel capacity coming onstream outside china to meet non chinese demand
6393078 the turkish mills are holding off buying scrap to push the price down

6393174 admittedly they normally only do this at weekends but weve stressed how difficult this could be
6393175 a number of our members have told us how frustrated they are
6393176 for some smaller members its a delay and an irritation the main problem is for the larger firms who have staff dedicated to tax returns
6393177 in todays environment you simply do not take systems down at your own convenience without any thought about the impact on users
6393178 any maintenance should be done out of hours i e evenings overnight weekends because the cost of any other approach is completely unacceptable one only has to weigh up the cost of a few it staff on overtime against a working day for all those who use the system
6393179 there are many ways of testing offline and then reintroducing the service almost seamlessly
6393180 testing is one of the achilles heels of the industry
6393181 the best way to test is to give adequate time and to allocate the time to fixing any mediocre results

6393190 the fei provisionally suspends all competitors who test positive in doping or positive medication cases at the olympic games in the interests of the integrity of the sport
6393191 we are aware of the potential implications this has for equestrian sports and showjumping
6393192 the seriousness of this case is increased because four horses have tested positive for the same substance
6393193 i wouldnt like to speculate the international olympic committee will look at the sport from a broader perspective
6393194 leul a castigat putin dupa deprecierea brusca pana la 3 54 lei euro a fost o miscare asemanatoare cu a celorlalte monede din regiune insa si dobanzile erau foarte jos in prima parte a zilei iar acum au mai urcat

6393197 i am not a prude in fact i am quite broad minded but this is completely inappropriate for children
6393198 i bought the book for my niece as a present and was reading it when i came across the word
6393199 the book has an attractive cover and is clearly for children they should not have to be subjected to trash and vulgarity
6393200 i did not expect this from a well respected author and do not want my young niece to have to see this obscene slang
6393201 she comes to visit me regularly and we read to each other
6393202 we have all the enid blyton books such as the famous five and secret seven and had finished all of them
6393203 i thought i would get her something a little more modern and had heard about jacqueline wilson through the popular tracy beaker television series
6393204 i knew she was held in high regard and had been a childrens laureate but thought i ought to read through the book to make sure it was not too sad
6393205 i got to the page where reference was made to a toffeenosed twit
6393206 on the next page the word changed i thought i was mistaken but then i saw to my shock it had been repeated twice again
6393207 i asked her if she was aware of this word and if she could do something about it
6393208 i would like her to explain how she would want me to explain this to my daughter even if it is in the context of the character
6393209 in the context of the character we felt it was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie would speak to each other
6393210 the book is aimed at children aged ten and over and we felt it was acceptable for that age range
6393211 however in light of this response we have decided to amend the word when we reprint the book
6393212 since the book was launched in march this year we have sold over 28 000 copies and this is the first complaint we have had
6393213 jacqueline wilson books are extremely popular with our customers and are the top selling childrens books in most high street stores

6393237 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital

6393239 there are two torn bodies lying there which we believe are those of the suicide bombers
6393240 it is the responsibility of thai airways to take him out of the country
6393241 he was very together complaining about some pain but what most worried him was finding his parents
6393242 maria was also asking constantly for her mother who she identified as amaya
6393243 i rescued seven people but there were a lot of dead all you could see of the plane was the motors because it was totally charred
6393244 i saw the charred body of a child and another boy was badly burned i think i saw another child covered with a blanket i also saw a dead stewardess and the captain but there was no crying no screaming
6393245 the engine fire had nothing to do with the fault that was repaired minutes earlier

6393251 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6393252 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6393253 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6393254 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6393255 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6393256 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
6393257 i think they are getting there on the top and its going to be extremely difficult to change that
6393258 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
6393259 they have a generation that is already ok and ready for london 2012
6393260 i expect more international athletes got really frightened and scared about using doping
6393261 we are making progress its becoming far more difficult to cheat than it was before
6393262 its not pleasant to think that about 25 kilometers from sochi there is a potential region of instability in abkhazia
6393263 the russians have pledged total security and told us we should not be concerned about that i could only hope these territorial conflicts can be solved as soon possible thats the work of the politicians
6393264 i would expect all of them to be back and more

6393266 pienso que el objetivo es ganar todas las competiciones en las que participemos incluso el campeonato de liga es complicado pero no hay nada imposible para eso y para todo es importante empezar bien porque es importante para el grupo
6393267 todo va bien al principio fue dif cil porque he tenido que perder peso pero con el trabajo que he tenido que hacer con los t cnicos y los m dicos me est n yendo bien las cosas yo quer a dejar le mans para venir a un equipo superior y por eso no estaba en las mejores condiciones por eso me dej ir ahora estoy contento por el esfuerzo que he realizado pensaba perder el peso lo m s r pido posible y lo he conseguido

6393275 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6393276 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
6393277 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
6393278 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
6393279 councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different
6393280 may have to take action much more often and if necessary put obese children on

6393282 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6393283 it was a lovely warm family service for an old lady who was obviously much loved

6393291 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6393292 we have taken the hard decision to put it down unfortunately
6393293 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6393294 you said youd give us a 24 hour stay of execution
6393295 this is certainly not what we would have hoped we would have hoped that the animal would have been ok

6393326 the fall in the number of children taking foreign languages is of concern particularly as we know from last years results that there is wide regional gap in those taking these exams
6393327 there are areas where fewer than one in four children are entered for a modern foreign language and it is the most disadvantaged families that are worst affected
6393328 we spread the word around the athletes before the games that we were offering it to them for free
6393329 certainly we did intend the downloads to be a subtle form of protest for the athletes as well as an act of solidarity for the tibetan people and the dalai lama

6393339 i have nothing substantive to confirm or deny this particular suggestion
6393340 we are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it
6393341 would probably defer in the first instance to the french authorities
6393342 we have no reports of any casualties caused by close air support

6393344 this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6393345 sarkozy did not make any statements after his talks with president karzai just a photo op leaving many questions unanswered
6393346 the main questions now how will the loss of soldiers affect the french mission here and also sarkozys decision to send reinforcements as promised earlier this year
6393347 it is a moment for contemplation but there also has to be a time for reflection on the sense of our presence in afghanistan
6393348 was failing both on the political and the military level
6393349 its objectives may be just but is the strategy being used to achieve them the right one
6393350 it is only by leaving behind local forces capable of containing the taliban that western soldiers will be able one day to get out of the afghan quagmire without giving the impression that they have lost the war
6393351 is whether public opinion will be reinforced in its feeling of the uselessness of the french presence in afghanistan or will the public rally round their soldiers in difficulty and become more favourable to it

6393386 the brrs bruces rave and rant of the world are the cause of the poor education our children receive in maths and the numerical sciences at least

6393389 the faith as such is always the same therefore st pius xs catechism always retains its value there can be persons or groups that feel more comfortable with st pius xs catechism it should not be forgotten that that catechism stemmed from a text that was prepared by the pope himself pius x when he was bishop of mantua the text was the fruit of the personal catechetical experience of giuseppe sarto whose characteristics were simplicity of exposition and depth of content also because of this st pius xs catechism might have friends in the future

6393407 maybe theyre some sort of carrier pigeon but do carrier pigeons even fly anymore
6393408 only on gilligans island tv land listen to me youre just guessing
6393409 obviously they are what if they need to carry these things farther still what if theyre just resting what if they are trained to do this when they need to rest drop their packages find a hole rest then grab their stuff and carry on
6393410 so are you suggesting we flush them out cause there is no way im going to crawl back there they can get out later on their own

6393425 we think newspaper stocks have further room to fall as declining revenues and negative operating leverage combine to create a downward spiral for this moribund industry
6393426 we expect mcclatchy to see 4 7 annual revenue declines over the next five years and only irregular profitability

6393436 this is an impressive squad and i think its the best one ive seen in four years
6393437 now we can begin a new season and hopefully we can say in the not too distant future that this years sevilla is the best of all time
6393438 the team must go step by step but the main goal is the champions league should we succeed in this important task well benefit greatly
6393439 but im also aware that if youre among the top four as we were for two seasons you can have the chance to fight for more so of course we must go for the liga
6393440 debates are part of campaigning and campaigning is part of the job

6393447 we are really asking the whole town to help out and support the cause if anyone can go outside and pick up some rubbish off the streets this week it will help

6393449 der klassische weg sicherzustellen dass es in der zukunft keine nahrungsmittel mehr gibt
6393450 aufgrund unserer verehrung der wissenschaft f r die forschungs elite einfach
6393451 die regierung ist moralisch verpflichtet zu untersuchen ob gentechnisch modifizierte nahrungsmittel die hungersn te in der dritten welt mildern k nnen
6393452 ich bin prinz charles dankbar dass er das thema angesprochen hat
6393453 er hat bedeutende zweifel ge u ert die von vielen menschen geteilt werden aber regierungsminister sind verpflichtet ihre politik auf eine wissenschaftliche basis zu stellen
6393454 wenn er sagt wir m ssen nachhaltig anbauen dann meint er uns nicht sich selbst
6393455 er ist selbst nach aristokratischen ma st ben furchtbar dumm
6393456 warum soll man einen zustand tolerieren in dem ein farmarbeiter in seinem leben nicht so viel verdienen kann wie wir diesem verh tschelten einfaltspinsel im jahr zahlen

6393459 i am satisfied because we drew against the world champions and that is a good result for us
6393460 we made a lot of the running in the first half and its just a shame that we conceded a goal on the stroke of half time
6393461 errors like that of ramazan zcan that made it 2 2 are just part of the game but i know that we have a lot of work to do to eliminate these mistakes
6393462 im not sure if we will start our first euro 2008 qualifier against france with the same men but i am delighted with their efforts
6393463 im only going on loan nothings forever theres still an open door
6393464 sunderland is a new challenge a team that people think small looking to grow up and that invest a lot in signings to achieve a good season
6393465 we had the chance of replying to the offers of other clubs like manchester city but he as well as me said no
6393466 people were perhaps expecting djibril to move to a prestigious team and sunderland without being among the great english clubs are part of a league where clubs have all the economic power and sporting importance
6393467 with sunderland it isnt an impulsive thing he wanted to leave and showed a massive desire to play
6393468 he has not had a great deal of football recently either which is a concern for us we send them away with our best wishes you hope while they are away they get game time
6393469 but he has not had a great deal of football so hopefully he can hit the ground running he has been in competitive games but going in for 10 to 15 minutes a time is not the ideal preparation for premier league games so it might take a little bit of time to get up to speed
6393470 i think he will be involved with us very very quickly we hope that he will settle quickly he has got the ability to and he will give us a presence up front which we lacked last weekend
6393471 i am satisfied because we drew against the world champions and that is a good result for us
6393472 we made a lot of the running in the first half and its just a shame that we conceded a goal on the stroke of half time
6393473 errors like that of ramazan zcan that made it 2 2 are just part of the game but i know that we have a lot of work to do to eliminate these mistakes
6393474 im not sure if we will start our first euro 2008 qualifier against france with the same men but i am delighted with their efforts
6393475 i spoke to the prime minister on the phone and he told me everybody is in the streets
6393476 messi is a superstar he is a genius and my tactics against him didnt work well
6393477 to defend against lionel messi is the biggest thing we have to do we just have to make sure we stay close to him and we dont give him the chances like we did the last time in the under 20 world cup

6393481 i dont think satanism is the only thing to blame
6393482 aggression management workshops should be held where the valuing of people would be encouraged
6393483 often adults including teachers feel that they are being disrespected by learners while pupils can also be disrespected by adults who may use sarcasm or belittle them
6393484 i dont think so they are merely reporting on what is going on we ourselves are contributing to the matter all the way from parliament to the family structure
6393485 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6393486 we have taken the hard decision to put it down unfortunately
6393487 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6393488 you said youd give us a 24 hour stay of execution
6393489 this is certainly not what we would have hoped we would have hoped that the animal would have been ok
6393490 we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success
6393491 this week also i believe that our olympic athletes who like everyone else in the country will remember you have shown exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication
6393492 you make the country proud every day of the week and every week of the year
6393493 you are truly the heroes of our country and i wish to say how proud of you i am today
6393494 what you are doing is part of an incredibly important process creating not only a terrorist free afghanistan but an afghanistan where there will be democracy and a stake in the future long term
6393495 you know that you are on the front line in the fight against the taliban
6393496 you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6393497 cabinet ministers plotting is nothing new we have it in afghanistan although not my foreign minister
6393498 it is a good relationship we get on with the job
6393499 we are utterly resolved in our determination to support this new democracy in afghanistan
6393500 we will not relax from our efforts to support the renewal of afghanistan because we understand that with afghanistan the front line against the taliban affects the rest of the world
6393501 prime minister gordon brown has been personally interested in afghanistan he has a very kind heart and especially a kind heart for afghanistan
6393502 britain is one of the lead countries in helping the people of afghanistan they have soldiers here and their soldiers have sacrificed their lives here they are among the largest donors to afghanistan
6393503 they have been with us all along from 2002 until today

6393541 the biggest question now is what is going to happen to household energy bills in the future todays news of a key gas pipeline being shut and wholesale gas prices increasing as a result does not augur well for consumers
6393542 unfortunately all the evidence points towards a steady climb upwards for energy bills this will be cold comfort to households this winter
6393543 i would also urge people to contact their suppliers to find out what help they can get towards making their home more energy efficient we are all paying an extra 39 a year on our bills towards suppliers energy efficiency schemes so why not try to get something back

6393558 what you are doing is part of an incredibly important process of creating not only a terrorist free afghanistan but an afghanistan where there will be democracy and people will have a stake in the future for the long term

6393565 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate

6393568 upon an in depth consideration of the submission of both counsel for and against the application the court is of the view that the accused is presumed innocent

6393570 since the prosecution has failed to provide reasonable evidence why the accused should not be granted bail the court therefore hold that the accused be granted bail

6393574 we are witnessing a shift back toward balance versus the heat everyone had felt a year ago around the facebook ecosystem that felt like it could be the next new thing with unbounded upside
6393575 while that ecosystem is still interesting its become crowded and users have shown enough signs of app fatigue that the doors are closing
6393576 whats unclear is can one application company on facebook build a few hundred million dollar business im personally skeptical
6393577 you need to be cross platform you need to control your customer you need to be on facebook myspace hi5 bebo and essentially have your app available throughout the internet
6393578 for the non web savvy a widget company invokes negative images of a commodity product
6393579 at the same time it doesnt sound from an investor perspective that youre investing in something thats shallow and not indicative of the amount of time put into the technology
6393580 this market is extremely confusing to marketers some who even dont understand what facebook is
6393581 all of the language on the site will be shifting
6393582 a lot of people are skeptical about how were monetized but growth is there and theres a lot of potential upside
6393583 the best we can do is keep growing and make sure were the destination of choice for advertisers
6393584 businesses that are building traffic first have to show much larger traffic numbers or have a more thoughtful plan to monetize their business in order to be convincing
6393585 this market is extremely confusing to marketers some who even dont understand what facebook is
6393586 the vcs are taking a step back but whats the reality behind this is that it takes a long time for marketers to understand where their customers are at

6393592 i was the youngest ever to win the world juniors and from that day on it has meant a lot to me i have done a lot in the 200 meters the world junior record holder world youth it means a lot i can not really explain it is just close to my heart and i will always love the 200 meters
6393593 i will not compare myself to michael phelps he swims he is a great athlete to win eight gold medals that is just great i am on the track he is in the water so you really can not compare it pretty much but he is a great athlete and i congratulate him on being the best at what he does
6393594 i do not think i will be going up to the 400 meters anytime soon but right now i guess the next aim is really to just finish the season injury free and then i will be looking forward to the world championships in 2009 after the world championships i will probably think about doing something else i am not sure me and my coach will decide that when the time comes

6393612 while it is true that there is a summer offensive by the taliban it is true that the tactics that the taliban have had to adopt are more of a guerrilla nature than head on confrontation with our forces
6393613 what you are doing is part of an incredibly important process of creating not only a terrorist free afghanistan but an afghanistan where there will be democracy and people will have a stake in the future for the long term

6393867 separating carecentrix enables us to devote gentivas full resources and attention to the extraordinary growth potential in our home care business including our industry leading specialty programs
6393868 going forward gentiva will generate 95 of its revenues from home health and hospice services by separating carecentrix at this juncture we are both unlocking value for shareholders today and preserving the potential to deliver future value as water street an accomplished healthcare investor provides the expertise resources and relationships to help carecentrix maximize its potential we think that carecentrix and its many talented employees will thrive under water streets direction and we look forward to participating in that success via our continued equity investment
6393869 we are excited that gentiva has selected water street as the partner best suited to support its corporate goals and strategically grow carecentrix carecentrix has distinguished itself by helping organizations better manage healthcare costs and enhance patient care we believe carecentrix can play an even bigger and more impactful role in achieving positive outcomes as more organizations utilize home health products and services as a primary approach for providing quality cost effective care our objective is to build on carecentrixs strong foundation and drive greater value by expanding its services to more payers and providers
6393870 the separation from gentiva is both recognition of what we have built together and an important milestone in charting carecentrixs future growth with water streets support we will gain access to additional resources strengthen our technology and infrastructure and leverage marketplace relationships all of this will further improve our ability to serve customers our provider ancillary care network and ultimately our patients were looking forward to working with the water street team and to continuing to deliver results that benefit gentiva as well
6393871 despite the continued weakness in the economy and in the mens apparel business we saw an improvement in our sales performance trends this past quarter although overall store traffic continues to be down our conversion rates and average sales transactions are up which indicate to us we are executing well in this difficult retail environment

6393920 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6393921 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6393922 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6393923 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6393924 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6393925 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6393926 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6393927 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6393928 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6393929 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6393932 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6393933 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6393934 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6393935 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

6393937 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6393938 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6393939 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6393940 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6393941 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6393942 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6393943 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6393944 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6393945 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6393946 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6393947 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6393949 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6393950 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6393951 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6393952 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6393953 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6393954 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6393955 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6393956 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6393968 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6393969 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6393970 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6393976 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6393977 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6393978 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

6393989 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6393990 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza

6394001 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

6394004 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6394005 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6394006 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6394007 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6394008 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6394009 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6394010 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6394011 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6394012 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6394013 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6394014 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6394015 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6394016 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6394017 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6394018 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6394019 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6394020 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6394021 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6394022 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6394023 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6394024 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6394025 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6394026 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6394027 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6394028 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6394029 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6394030 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6394031 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6394032 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6394033 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6394034 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6394035 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6394036 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6394037 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6394038 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6394039 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6394040 in 2012 we will stage a spectacular sporting event but i am also determined that london should realise the potential that the 2012 games offer to make our city greater still through the legacy that we can leave for generations to come
6394041 a huge amount of our investment in the olympic park is for legacy
6394042 since my election as mayor i have insisted on new focus and more impetus in planning and delivering this long term legacy
6394043 we are looking for ideas of how londons olympic park can become not just a great place to live work and visit but a place that retains a flavour of the extra ordinary a place with the wow factor a place of magic we are looking for the mix of imagination and realism that marks out the truly great ideas and will create a truly great place
6394044 its no exaggeration to say that the future of london lies in the five host boroughs of greenwich tower hamlets hackney waltham forest and newham the olympic park sits at the heart of an area of unrivalled opportunity for business one of the largest urban development sites in europe
6394045 were looking for the worlds most creative minds to bring their ideas and investment to this the most exciting area of london to add to the buzz that the 2012 games is already generating and to underpin the areas growing prosperity and development
6394046 we want to ensure that the legacy development of the olympic park captures any truly exceptional ground breaking ideas from around the world whether it is an event iconic development or attraction we want to hear ideas that could complement and enhance our ambitions for europes largest urban regeneration project

6394061 effectively these are yesterdays migrants as well as todays migrants contributing to this high level of population growth

6394063 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6394064 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6394065 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6394066 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6394067 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6394068 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6394069 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6394070 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

6394073 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

6394082 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6394083 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6394084 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6394085 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6394086 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6394087 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6394088 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6394089 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6394090 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6394091 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6394092 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6394093 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6394094 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6394095 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6394096 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6394097 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6394098 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6394099 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6394100 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6394101 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6394102 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6394103 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6394104 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6394105 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6394106 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6394107 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6394108 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6394109 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6394110 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6394111 due parole da un vecchio amico che continua a cercarti nei tuoi scritti
6394112 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6394113 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6394114 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6394115 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6394116 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6394117 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6394118 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6394119 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6394120 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6394121 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6394122 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6394123 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6394124 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6394125 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6394126 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6394127 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6394128 got sick of waiting for husband to fix leaky sink and did it myself
6394129 i dont know my tools i use the honey dew approach to tool working jobs
6394130 working outside one day my bluejeans had its top button pop off
6394131 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6394132 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6394133 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6394134 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6394135 due parole da un vecchio amico che continua a cercarti nei tuoi scritti
6394136 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6394137 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6394138 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6394139 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6394140 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6394141 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6394142 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6394143 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6394144 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6394145 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6394146 o inferno exot rmico ou endot rmico justifique sua resposta
6394147 its the only one where the lower case g is just right
6394148 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6394149 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6394150 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6394151 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6394152 das ist zu viel gewollt man darf ja auch nicht vergessen dass wir das kers selbst noch nicht mal auf der strecke gefahren haben ich finde es ziemlich gescheit dass die teams die anregung gegeben haben lieber erstmal ein jahr praktische erfahrung mit den kers zu sammeln ehe sie sich gedanken ber einen ganz neuen antriebsstrang f r eine zukunftsf hige formel 1 machen k nnen

6394173 por eso lo invito a l y a todo el que quiera a debatir pero sin insultos ni ofensas s lo propuestas argumentos nada de descalificaciones
6394174 porqu no lo hizo cuando fue alcalde hace 15 a os ni ahora siendo gobernador
6394175 es que se la pasa ofreciendo cosas para maracaibo que no las ha hecho y no las va a hacer

6394188 he went out on friday night with two mates he was just waiting for a taxi when a group came up and asked him for a cigarette
6394189 he didnt have one thats what he said before he collapsed
6394190 apparently there are witnesses and we just want them to come forward so we know how this happened
6394191 he just deteriorated i tried to wake him but he got agitated and shouted get off me leave me alone
6394192 this confirms our worst fear that there are indeed conscious attempt to sabotage the nation and reverse the progress we have so far made as a democratic nation
6394193 the call for interim government has no place in the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria and is therefore not only illegal but also treasonable to the extent that it calls for the overthrow of an established constitutional order
6394194 the motive and intentions of this group are very clear that is to create confusion and cause general disaffection within the polity because of their failure at the polls this is a further evidence of the bad loser syndrome
6394195 we believe that the responsibility of amending the nigerian constitution to accommodate any emergent issue on the political structure of nigeria lies entirely with the elected representatives of the people in the national and state assemblies
6394196 the allegation by the pdp amounts to shooting the breeze and it is the work of a ruling party that has no initiative on how to address the plethora of problems facing the country and how to ensure better life for the countrys long suffering citizens
6394197 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource developments
6394198 we have quite a bit of work to be done to finalize numbers given the early stages that were in today
6394199 the first thing we have to do is get the core team back my hope would be that sometime into the early part of next year well have the full complement of resources
6394200 much of the construction will likely start in the 2013 2014 range so theres a lot of engineering work to be done
6394201 theres a significant amount of work here as much as we can handle and more
6394202 weve got the lead time to build the capacity it gives lots of lead time for people to come back and work in the province so we can gear up and well take whatever we can handle
6394203 weve focused on the eight to 10 components that really fit our long term strategy and can be built here in our yards and can be moved around effectively
6394204 we think weve structured this in a fashion to get as much work and experience as we can in our available yards and infrastructure as well as protecting the economics of the project
6394205 if were going to be full partners in the industry then you have to behave like partners
6394206 this is not an unusual challenge for the industry but when we have a partner like the province here were comfortable we can work this out
6394207 getting formal agreements done is one step in a long journey
6394208 well continue our discussions to make sure that hebron becomes a reality but this is a sign that the industry and the province can do business together
6394209 theres a generation of students that understand that the modern world has been shaped by agriculture and they are turning to their curriculum to understand those connections

6394224 there is consensus among most social and medical science scholars that a minimum of 10 to 30 per cent of women who abort suffer from serious negative psychological consequences
6394225 we believe that cougle et al operate with strong political views regarding abortion and unfortunately their biases appear to have resulted in serious methodological flaws in the analysis published in your journal
6394226 all are involved in building a literature to be used in efforts to restrict access to abortion

6394386 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6394387 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work
6394388 we are very very close to a sofa status of forces agreement but its not done
6394389 undoubtedly its true that the negotiators have taken this very very far towards an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement
6394390 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6394391 i am not going into the details now where we are on in specific issues except to say i think all issues have moved forward in a positive way
6394392 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6394393 not one person in this room has a clue whats going on its a total waste of time going back and forth on a draft no one has ever seen
6394394 se ha actuado seg n los estandares y procedimientos que marcan los manuales del avi n
6394395 lo primero que pens al ver salir esa enorme masa de humo fue que era de los bomberos que estaban haciendo alg n tipo de pr cticas en la pista pero al ver como crec a y crec a sin parar la humareda me dije esto tiene que ser algo mucho m s grave
6394396 porque las cabinas est n muy insonorizadas respecto al exterior
6394397 a trav s de la torre de control que hab a habido un accidente de la compa a spanair
6394398 a partir de ah me comentaron que ten an que cerrar las dos pistas la izquierda porque era donde hab a ocurrido el accidente y estaba llena de restos y la derecha por precauci n y para permitir el tr nsito de ambulancias y bomberos que m s tarde fueron llegando
6394399 los medios s lo hablaban todav a de entre dos y siete muertos y los pasajeros de nuestro avi n iban bastante tranquilos eso s la tripulaci n me coment que nunca en un vuelo se hab a prestado tanta atenci n a las demostraciones de seguridad
6394400 la compa a afectada est atravesando una mala situaci n
6394401 estaba aterrizando en barajas cuando de repente vi al fondo una bola de humo grand sima y por la humareda que sal a pens que ten a que haber pasado algo muy gordo
6394402 estar preparados para afrontar todo tipo de aver as en un avi n una vez despegado incluidos fallos en el motor y la manera de aterrizar con un motor que no funciona

6394408 estou me sentindo prejudicado porque o orkut era minha nica ferramenta de contato com muitas pessoas da lista
6394409 eu tinha apenas o logotipo de um partido em meu lbum de fotos que estava restrito aos meus amigos

6394429 lo m s urgente es acelerar todo el proceso de las autopsias y la identificaci n de los cad veres
6394430 el proceso en el que nos encontramos ahora es el de identificaci n que es un proceso bastante m s lento y que lo est realizando el departamento cient fico de la guardia civil
6394431 los expertos de la divisi n cient fica de la guardia civil y la polic a nacional son tremendamente profesionales y est n haciendo las labores de identificaci n a trav s del adn de algunos familiares para evitar en el caso de un deterioro grave del cuerpo que se tenga que producir una identificaci n visual

6394436 there are so many variables in bringing a production to broadway theatre availability artists schedules and securing capitalization to name a few
6394437 its impossible not to be cognizant of the national economy and its potential impact on the theatre but its also premature to say whether the recent changes in plans by certain shows represent a trend especially as were likely to see other productions quickly step up to fill the available theatres in their stead

6394457 our band got christened sometime in early 1985 the red october factory the name seemed perfect it contained the word factory in it for starters but it also alluded to the eastern bloc the real red october was a russian factory that either produced warheads or chocolate i cant remember and all that that entailed the name was austere and industrial everything we aspired to be musically

6394483 i look upon death to be as necessary to the constitution as sleep we shall rise refreshed in the morning
6394484 finding myself to exist in the world i believe i shall in some shape or other always exist
6394485 i did not begin when i was born nor when i was conceived i have been growing developing through incalculable myriads of millenniums all my previous selves have their voices echoes promptings in me oh incalculable times again shall i be born
6394486 i have been born more times than anybody except krishna
6394487 as we live through thousands of dreams in our present life so is our present life only one of many thousands of such lives which we enter from the other more real life and then return after death our life is but one of the dreams of that more real life and so it is endlessly until the very last one the very real the life of god
6394488 i adopted the theory of reincarnation when i was 26 genius is experience some think to seem that it is a gift or talent but it is the fruit of long experience in many lives
6394489 as long as you are not aware of the continual law of die and be again you are merely a vague guest on a dark earth
6394490 live so that thou mayest desire to live again that is thy duty for in any case thou will live again
6394491 i cannot think of permanent enmity between man and man and believing as i do in the theory of reincarnation i live in the hope that if not in this birth in some other birth i shall be able to hug all of humanity in friendly embrace
6394492 the soul comes from without into the human body as into a temporary abode and it goes out of it anew it passes into other habitations for the soul is immortal
6394493 it is the secret of the world that all things subsist and do not die but only retire a little from sight and afterwards return again
6394494 so as through a glass and darkly the age long strife i see where i fought in many guises many names but always me
6394495 i know i am deathless no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before i laugh at what you call dissolution and i know the amplitude of time
6394496 our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting the soul that rises with us our lifes star hath had elsewhere its setting and cometh from afar
6394497 i died as a mineral and became a plant i died as a plant and rose to animal i died as animal and i was man why should i fear when was i less by dying
6394498 my life often seemed to me like a story that has no beginning and no end i had the feeling that i was an historical fragment an excerpt for which the preceding and succeeding text was missing i could well imagine that i might have lived in former centuries and there encountered questions i was not yet able to answer that i had been born again because i had not fulfilled the task given to me
6394499 i am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again that the living spring from the dead and that the souls of the dead are in existence
6394500 souls are poured from one into another of different kinds of bodies of the world
6394501 all pure and holy spirits live on in heavenly places and in course of time they are again sent down to inhabit righteous bodies
6394502 all human beings go through a previous life who knows how many fleshly forms the heir of heaven occupies before he can be brought to understand the value of that silence and solitude of spiritual worlds
6394503 when the physical organism breaks up the soul survives it then takes on another body
6394504 friends are all souls that weve known in other lives were drawn to each other even if i have only known them a day it doesnt matter im not going to wait till i have known them for two years because anyway we must have met somewhere before you know

6394565 they have to do it a little more craftily than in the past but it wouldnt be too hard for them the conservatives to set a trap for the liberals
6394566 prime minister stephen harper can engineer the defeat of his government in 30 seconds
6394567 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
6394568 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc qu b cois and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately mr dion has indicated that the government has to be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
6394569 a lot of patience and because i struck at the right time
6394570 a bit of reform party hocus pocus so now harper is caught in that but not really caught
6394571 its what in the trade they call a pious hope in other words a promise that can be broken with impunity if you think you can get away with it
6394572 he wants to get the opposition especially the liberals to put up or shut up
6394573 and so this is a lot of posturing and chest beating on behalf of both harper and dion
6394574 i dont think the liberals can continue to play the same game
6394575 now that stage is over and mr dion is the one who has to make a tough decision
6394576 we want an election as soon as we move ahead in the polls
6394577 i cant wait to see the look in your evil eyes
6394578 the opposition cannot continue to criticize the government on every single bill
6394579 right wing politics have a proven record especially in ontario of destroying an economy

6394624 over the past year weve strengthened our u s businesses by selectively hiring top talent from other firms
6394625 weve been able to do this because of the strength and reputation of our enterprise plus the fact that market disruptions have made available many outstanding professionals
6394626 the investigation has already begun to uncover some disturbing facts that seem to belie the innocent picture of downstream brokerages you paint in your letter
6394627 for example some evidence indicates that fidelity was actively marketing auction rate securities to its high net worth clients
6394628 fidelity does not actively market these securities and does not offer special financial incentives to representatives if they sell these securities

6394676 every time a shovel goes in the ground in the city it gives someone the confidence to say things are happening again lets get moving
6394677 we do not view what would be happening more than a half mile away as necessarily competitive to our efforts but i do think it behooves all of us that we do coordinate our respective efforts to ensure the future of east baltimore is a solid one
6394678 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice some of the people sentenced only met their lawyers for the first time during the trial while several said they suffered torture when they were held incommunicado and that they were forced to confess to crimes those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system how is that justice
6394679 the sudanese government has the duty to investigate crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice but they must do it in accordance with international law and the sudanese constitution which guarantees fair trials we urge the sudanese authorities not to execute these men and to review their cases immediately
6394680 yet again we have seen an act of bad faith by the minister on one hand she promised to end the nightmare in this sector where people waiting on their contracts to be renewed only to move the goalposts which will throw essential community workers out of their jobs and could see the collapse of many projects

6394684 these are excellent results once again demonstrating that our young people are dedicated to their studies and performing to the best of their ability congratulations to all involved in achieving these excellent results and the teachers and parents who inspired and motivated our young students
6394685 however whilst overall these are excellent results too many young people are leaving education without 5 gcses

6394700 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6394701 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6394702 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6394703 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6394704 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work
6394705 that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6394706 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to want to think about the next day or week you just think about the next hour

6394708 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6394709 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6394710 he has been saying to me reinstating the judges minus one the one being the chief justice weve said its not a question of any individual its a question of the institution
6394711 if they are not restored it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying that
6394712 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify our stay in the coalition
6394713 members belonging to our party in the parliament asked asif to become the next president
6394714 there was an understanding between the coalition partners that the presidential candidate would be decided by mutual consensus
6394715 the dollar has been undermined by renewed concerns over the health of the us financial system
6394716 we might see some further scaling back of already diminished expectations for the federal reserve to raise us interest rates over the next six months
6394717 the message is clearly pretty downbeat with virtually every index below the 50 boom bust line it looks like most sectors and countries in the eurozone are contracting
6394718 our new home page is designed to accommodate the new news channels we have introduced in recent months and to present our content in a more attractive and coherent way
6394719 in addition we felt that news about online journalism has proliferated over the past year to the extent that we cannot possibly cover all angles
6394720 hence the introduction of the news aggregator which will allow us to provide a very comprehensive overview of the latest developments while still maintaining our in depth insights into the progress of the online publishing industry

6394830 there is still a long way to go before our cinema accepts a turbaned sikh as a hero in any movie there is a widespread perception that sikh guys are ideally suited only for the roles of a comedian or of a truck driver or a taxi driver
6394831 im delighted by how good mallika is at comedy i play the guy who tries to get her attention right under her husband paresh rawals nose
6394832 mallika is part of the theatre repertory in the film in fact all the principal actors mallika paresh who plays her husband kay kay menon and zakir hussain are part of the theatre group
6394833 im not part of the theatre group im a raw agent who needs to save the world by taking the help of the theatre company containing probably the worlds worst actors so the worlds worst theatre group is helping me to save the world
6394834 the only thing that this theatre group can do effectively on stage is a rendition of k asifs film mughall e azam thats where my salim act with anarkali comes in im only fantasising about being on stage with mallika
6394835 mallika had given the film her best shot and was expecting it to be a glorious follow up to pyaar ke side effects the poor show of the film has affected her shes no longer that confident of her next release maan gaye mughall e azam
6394836 those who saw the movie told the authorities they were shocked to find that bachchan played the role of god
6394837 such films should not be released anywhere in the world because they are not only against islamic teachings but are against the teachings of all heavenly religions

6394863 thats not really me and that will come out in the show because i am not like that at all
6394864 i felt i had to put on that face to get into the program because at the first audition they said youve got to stand out and be a bit different
6394865 so i went along with that and it worked out
6394866 i did think about moving to wollongong once i got down there and saw how nice it was
6394867 but all my friends are up here and so is the nightlife
6394868 i did go to castros the gay club and to the glasshouse and the north gong so i did get into the nightlife but i just love it up here so much
6394869 the big cache and six cores will give customers a nice bump in performance
6394870 it looks like at least from the benchmarks were seeing that six core chips offer more performance than quad cores so yes customers are going to want them what we dont know is how much power the chips consume and how much heat they will dissipate and those are key concerns but all in all this is a pretty big advance in the state of the art and all the major vendors are on board
6394871 these chips outperform anything amd has and probably win on price performance too this could cut amds share of the server market considerably
6394872 intel doesnt have to crank up chip performance right now to thwart amd
6394873 their current products handily outperform amd on server products from my own research i can tell you that x86 server customers have moved away from amd and towards intel so intel didnt need to release this stuff now to catch up to amd or to top them but theyre doing it anyway just to keep the pressure up on amd and on themselves
6394874 if software cant take advantage of it what does it buy you
6394875 you still have software partitioning issues and when you put more cores on a chip you have to run it slower or increase the power consumption budget or thermal limitations
6394876 the fact that people were up there kicking the tires means nothing from a financial standpoint and therefore really shouldnt really play into what the price of these stocks is doing today

6394887 there is some kind of expectations of doing something before the end of the year
6394888 i believe that the timeline is important but what is more important is the content and the nature of the understanding that we can reach with the palestinians
6394889 i think any attempt to bridge gaps which might be premature to bridge or any attempt to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement we want to reach can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence
6394890 the question of how long it should be on the shelf depends not on our willingness but on the situation on the ground
6394891 this is the reason we negotiate with pragmatic leaders even though they dont control anything in gaza strip which is being controlled completely by hamas even in the west bank they are not strong enough

6394955 i am shattered had a good yesterday until i had to tack back to the south west to try and avoid the lightest of winds from the centre of the low tack completed it became evident that the sea state was not going to play that game again i tried sailing everywhere and anywhere to try and give the boat a ride that was not like trying to sail up a staircase it did not work and became increasingly frustrating with the boat just slamming so hard off what seemed like every wave to let you know what it feels like as you go up the wave the front of the boat becomes airborne the pilot does its best but is not clever enough to avoid what happens next as the wave passes under the boat a big hole appears that the boat promptly falls into because the hull is so flat the impact is horrendous the big fat underbelly of the boat slapping the water next thing to catch up with the boat is the wing mast which gives a massive judder chucking the masthead all over the place at the same time as this the fin and bulb canted out at 40 degrees to the boat flex and wobble which sends ripples through the boat for about 5 secs there is also a series of very loud noises kit bags cups sails nav station all banging round and giving the impression that they are about to disintegrate as you can imagine very very relaxing the reason the sea state is so bad here at the moment is due to the fact that the jetstream is firing all of the new depressions or low pressure systems much further south than normal thats why out here i just have one after another to deal with as these depressions make their way across the atlantic they change the wind and sea conditions massively in a fairly localised area as one system passes over disrupting the sea state another one is queuing up behind the sea never really gets a chance to get back to its normal pattern this is a really horrible way to sail and not good for the boat or the nerves but still it continues anyway after my tack last night i was down below checking on the first ship i had seen in days when there was massive bang on deck we had not fallen off a wave or anything so i rushed up to see what happened one of the shackles on the boom vang had just split in half bit of nightmare i had to drop the main and then work out a fix it took a couple of hours and then just before the dawn i had the big wind full mainsail from bottom to top lovely anyway got that done and collapsed exhausted looking forward to escaping the grey murk of the past few days and getting some decent sailing in oh no slam slam slam thats where i am now pretty fed up with it hopefully the sea state will get a little better as the breeze eases as i head west fingers crossed
6394956 the election was generally peaceful throughout the state whoever was elected had the backing of the electorates all that is needed now is for the people to embrace each other and prepare for the election proper as one big family it is a victory for common sense and a victory for democracy at the end this is not about individuals or sectional interests the people of adamawa and in fact democracy is actually the winner

6394960 together we shared together we endured and together we brought to triumph the liberation struggle
6394961 the spirit of the frontline states should invigorate us into action action that would see sadc emerge as the most purposeful most powerful and most regional economic grouping in our lifetime
6394962 the solidarity forged in the heat of struggle can today if properly harnessed help us forge regional integration at a greater pace let the sadc summit be the fire around which people in this region sit in unity solidarity and enthusiasm to chart a path of survival and prosperity through the jungle of a globalising world
6394963 the spirit of the frontline states to which president mkapa referred means that as members of sadc we must be ready and willing to work closely together understanding that we share a common destiny
6394964 it means that all of us must understand that what we do in any one of our countries has an impact on the rest it means that as countries we will sink or swim together
6394965 first as victims second as defiant people and third as victors the stages that this process went through covered agitation political organisation and eventually physical confrontation
6394966 the birth of the frontline states as a dependable rear base and victory which saw the establishment of sadc as an organ for economic transformation and consolidation of the regional security peace and defence must be carefully examined
6394967 none but ourselves will continue to be our liberators and this has been true from the time of the formation of the original sadcc in 1980 when we only had eight members who were also from the frontline states
6394968 sadcs strength has been its political unity and cohesion there are numerous challenges that we have faced but we have overcome these using the potent weapon of our cohesion
6394969 in reality our actions should define us as frontline states and it is in this spirit that we must approach the issue of zimbabwes political challenges
6394970 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6394971 we will not relax from our efforts to support reconstruction of afghanistan because we understand that with afghanistan the frontline against the taliban what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world
6394972 while it is true that there is a summer offensive by the taliban it is also true that the tactics the taliban had to adopt are more of a guerrilla nature than they are a head on confrontation with our forces and we have been successful in winning back territory

6395106 this is early research but provides an interesting insight into some of the potential players that cause different types of damage to the central nervous system in people with ms
6395107 understanding how ms develops is vital to target therapies for the condition

6395186 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
6395187 i think that if you went in and could see whats going on in their minds though they may never say that stuff and im not saying theres some conspiracy or something like that but i think the thing is they realise that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer
6395188 i think that just based on their actions what they say is one thing but what they do is another
6395189 when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is elicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit

6395307 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart he said
6395308 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge he said
6395309 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6395310 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded said zaheer shah of edhi rescue pakistans largest private charity

6395324 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6395325 brown fat can increase energy expenditure and protect against obesity
6395326 the epidemic of obesity closely associated with increases in diabetes hypertension hyperlipidemia cancer and other disorders has propelled a major interest in adipose cells and tissues
6395327 insights into the developmental origin of brown fat cells are of particular interest because of the ability of these cells to burn fat but as is often the case in science new questions follow new insights

6395330 when you have a brother who wants to be the number one most important person in the world it obviously gives you a lot of inspiration
6395331 there was a long time when i was just taking a break doing nothing trying to find myself and what i wanted to do now i am more focused on my future and i can say it is because i understand more about things because of hearing what barack is doing
6395332 it was difficult not knowing much about my father but when i read baracks book dreams of my father i learnt a lot and it really helped me to understand my past and my family
6395333 huruma is a tough place last january during the elections there was rioting and six people were hacked to death
6395334 the police dont even arrest you they just shoot you i have seen two of my friends killed i have scars from defending myself with my fists i am good with my fists
6395335 i want to work hard and get myself to somewhere more comfortable
6395336 we have only met twice once when i was five or six and again in 2006

6395338 i dont even tell people that i am related to barack obama i dont want people here to be harassing me because they think i have money or influence i have nothing like that i am a person who likes to live quietly
6395339 i dont have any ambitions to do anything like politics in kenya that means nothing i read the newspapers but only the sport section sometimes i am sure there are things about barack which i miss but it doesnt matter to me
6395340 the timing of the conclusion of the missile defense deal is anything but accidental
6395341 now that the missile system is going forward the deal takes on much sharper overtones from the russian perspective
6395342 before the georgia invasion i was against the installation of the missile shield in poland
6395343 but now after the events there i feel threatened from the east and i dont regret the decision
6395344 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6395345 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6395346 i think it helps the administrations case by creating a backdrop where geo political competition from all sorts has returned
6395347 on its merit the war in georgia is irrelevant to the debate over a missile defense system that is supposed to protect us from an iranian strike but when a war is going on the hard line voices have an upper hand

6395357 nous sommes dans le top 10 des services mobiles toutes cat gories confondues
6395358 exclusive live performances from some of the hottest uk and international artists in the teen world
6395359 id like to take this opportunity to say congratulations to all those who have made such positive efforts to kick the habit very well done
6395360 slave state that fought beside the north thats only because we couldnt figure out how to get to the south there were a couple of states in the way
6395361 you cannot go into a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts without an indian accent
6395362 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
6395363 i found it quite easy because ive been reading science books for a long time before i did the course
6395364 i pretty much knew a lot of it already so i didnt have to revise a lot
6395365 i was a little bit nervous and i was quite excited especially to get my results
6395366 i thought i could just sit it and see what happened but when it was over i thought i have to get a good result
6395367 im so relieved and the fact that we are all twins and are able to share this success together makes it more special
6395368 we are not that competitive but we support each other if one of us is doing revision then the other feels obliged to do the same
6395369 the social stress and the educational stress of being at school made me pass out and it was very difficult for me so leaving school was the right thing for me to do
6395370 accipio has meant i have been able to carry on with my learning and get over this difficult time
6395371 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario
6395372 you break down the walls as much as you possibly can
6395373 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6395374 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
6395375 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
6395376 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity
6395377 well make believe well play sambas in our hotel room
6395378 certainly he was quite serious with his efforts to engage in sex acts with a minor
6395379 im not a collector i want the real taste let me call you
6395380 i want to hear your girlish voice telling me what to do
6395381 when we organize ourselves as a region and we promote ourselves as a region were much more powerful
6395382 previous mayors have paid lip service to the notion of regionalism but its just never happened
6395383 the fact that mayor nutter made this an early priority and physically came out to the suburbs really spoke volumes
6395384 there are a lot of structural reasons for that animosity
6395385 the city and suburbs have competed for jobs residents for attention which often results in tensions
6395386 it was done in a way that tore at the fabric of regional cooperation
6395387 the county got bigfooted frankly by the arts world in the city and by the political leadership there in a way thats not particularly helpful
6395388 the fact that so many different organizations have to approve everything we work on that can be difficult because it can take a long time
6395389 what this usually requires is a central city mayor like richard daley in chicago to share the credit and work collaborative allow sometimes the suburban counterparts to take the lead on an initiative so that they have the buy in thats needed
6395390 when mayor daley goes to the caucus he goes in like any other mayor he sits in the back of the room and when he has a question he raises his hand i would expect to do the same thing
6395391 i just want to play an appropriate role in getting it started
6395392 we dont know what went on between mclaughlin and seamus oneill that caused mclaughlin to beat him to death with a baseball bat
6395393 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario
6395394 you break down the walls as much as you possibly can
6395395 his arms and legs were bound with duct tape behind his back
6395396 we are losing one of the best young boys in our community
6395397 it is heartbreaking i feel as though i lost my own child
6395398 this has happened in at least five stores in our community
6395399 the bulk of the conversation was about public safety and violence in their neighborhoods
6395400 if i had any of my own i would want them to be like him
6395401 its so sad and so unfair because he didnt deserve that

6395409 they join with another group where obama has strong support he said
6395410 we didnt really have a sense of what was going on out there we knew there was a potential for a problem
6395411 the state has that evidence now or i believe they do
6395412 then at 9 p m the girl was sealed for time and all eternity to warren steed jeffs
6395413 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia
6395414 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6395415 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6395416 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it
6395417 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy
6395418 there is no logic i can see for queensland to not develop uranium reserves
6395419 its a close call as to whether it will be avoided
6395420 the pmis are not arguing for a decline in gross domestic product in the third quarter
6395421 im not sure the numbers are going to shift sentiment at the ecb
6395422 he has oodles of natural ability but sometimes it looks like he is not completely 100 per cent committed if i was a team owner and paying a lot for a driver id want to know that the guy is giving the best he can
6395423 thats the good thing about this sport the drivers are not robots they are human beings and its down to them to tackle any given situation how they want
6395424 he is on or off but when hes on hes bloody good
6395425 they really do have that mystique that other teams dont have

6395433 fiscal 2008 proved to be disappointing after having finished the prior fiscal year with record setting sales and profits
6395434 we believe our initial sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2009 is conservative and it does not include the accretive benefits of any acquisitions or re imaging programs net sales are expected to be between 290 and 310 million and diluted per share earnings between 0 29 and 0 36
6395435 in accordance with our long established cash dividend policy guidelines we have established the annual indicated rate at 0 20 per share for fiscal 2009 this is down from the indicated rate of 0 60 per share for fiscal 2008 we have paid cash dividends to our shareholders since 1989
6395436 our balance sheet remains strong and we are conservatively capitalized with no debt and an unused 57 million credit facility the impairment we took was a non cash accounting charge and did not affect our tangible net worth liquidity cash or borrowing power
6395437 in summary we have all the required capabilities and assets to resume the growth of the company rest assured we are addressing the problems and weaknesses of fiscal 2008 and the opportunities of fiscal 2009 i look forward to reporting to you on our progress
6395438 i can run an nfl team and have them go undefeated because i rock

6395443 pemkot bandung memiliki puluhan hektar tanah dan bangunan yang belum terdata dengan baik siapa penyewa dan pengelolanya tidak diketahui begitu pula keberadaannya sekarang pemkot harus lebih perhatian
6395444 publik berhak tahu aset apa sajakah yang dikelola pemerintah yang tak lain adalah milik rakyat juga selain itu harus jelas pula di mana aset aset itu berada siapa pengelolanya sekarang bagaimana keadaannya dan bagaimana mengaksesnya
6395445 tanah yang disewakan sudah tidak diketahui sertifikatnya dan siapa pengelolanya kalau sudah begitu pemkot pun tak dapat menagih uang sewa yang seharusnya bisa menjadi pad pendapatan asli daerah
6395446 saya baru mendapat tupoksi tugas pokok dan fungsi untuk pengelolaan aset aset ini pada juni 2008 sebelumnya yang mengelola tanah dan bangunan adalah dinas perumahan
6395447 dprd menggunakan hak inisiatif perda ini dilatarbelakangi kondisi banyak atlet berprestasi yang kehidupannya memprihatinkan
6395448 selama ini pemberian penghargaan prestasi hanya insidental dan tidak berdasarkan peraturan mengikat harapan saya penerima penghargaan bukan hanya atlet melainkan juga pegiat olahraga yang berprestasi seperti pelatih
6395449 adanya peraturan tentang penghargaan akan mendukung kinerja atlet karena mereka memiliki harapan dari prestasi yang mereka capai
6395450 prestasi di kejuaraan nasional single event juga harus dihitung sebab di kejurnas semacam itu atlet juga membawa nama daerah
6395451 padahal untuk biaya pengobatan dan rumah sakit habis belasan juta

6395460 seni tradisi di shimane memiliki kemiripan dengan seni tradisi jawa bulan juni lalu saya mencoba tampil berkolaborasi dengan mereka lewat tarian jawa ternyata mereka menyadari kalau seni tradisi jawa dan shimane ada kemiripan

6395468 the argument billionaires bloggers and the battle to remake democratic politics
6395469 he doesnt intend to name anybody who is even remotely pro choice because he well understands that such a decision would be akin to committing suicide to quote rushs radio rant
6395470 all this talk about ridge and lieberman is just an elaborate feint his real purpose is to scare conservatives into thinking the worst so that they will sigh with relief when he ultimately names somebody who in their eyes is actually less than perfect thereby dampening whatever criticisms they might otherwise be tempted to voice
6395471 plus theres a wild card factor mccain may well be waiting to see who gets the democratic nod if obama chooses a national security candidate such as joe biden perhaps that helps the case for ridge the former homeland security director if obama chooses the stylistically boring evan bayh perhaps that helps the case for minnesota gov tim pawlenty an abortion foe who is also stylistically boring
6395472 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death

6395485 we are witnessing a shift back toward balance versus the heat everyone had felt a year ago around the facebook ecosystem that felt like it could be the next new thing with unbounded upside
6395486 while that ecosystem is still interesting its become crowded and users have shown enough signs of app fatigue that the doors are closing
6395487 whats unclear is can one application company on facebook build a few hundred million dollar business im personally skeptical
6395488 you need to be cross platform you need to control your customer you need to be on facebook myspace hi5 bebo and essentially have your app available throughout the internet
6395489 for the non web savvy a widget company invokes negative images of a commodity product
6395490 at the same time it doesnt sound from an investor perspective that youre investing in something thats shallow and not indicative of the amount of time put into the technology
6395491 this market is extremely confusing to marketers some who even dont understand what facebook is
6395492 all of the language on the site will be shifting
6395493 a lot of people are skeptical about how were monetized but growth is there and theres a lot of potential upside
6395494 the best we can do is keep growing and make sure were the destination of choice for advertisers
6395495 businesses that are building traffic first have to show much larger traffic numbers or have a more thoughtful plan to monetize their business in order to be convincing
6395496 this market is extremely confusing to marketers some who even dont understand what facebook is
6395497 the vcs are taking a step back but whats the reality behind this is that it takes a long time for marketers to understand where their customers are at
6395498 if youre just out there developing widgets its a really long shot to do that independently that heyday is over the fun and games widget theyll be a long shot the next phase is with utility if it takes up space it has to be useful
6395499 kami adalah kawan lama yang sudah jarang bertemu dan setelah bertemu sepakat untuk menggelar pameran dengan tema bebas

6395504 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
6395505 for this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make special request for you asking that you may be filled with the full deep and clear knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things that you may walk live and conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him and desiring to please him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of god with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition we pray that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory to exercise every kind of endurance and patience perseverance and forbearance with joy giving thanks to the father

6395520 not because of polar bears not because of butterflies or frogs or penguins or rainforests much as i love them all it is because everything i have fought for and that all campaigners for social justice have ever fought for food clean water shelter security is jeopardised by climate change
6395521 failing to take adequate account of the environmental impact of coal
6395522 replacing old coal fired power stations with new ones rather than using alternative energy sources locks britain into a high level of emissions for many years to come
6395523 i challenge george monbiot to test out which is the most dangerous fuel coal or nuclear power i am prepared to go into a room full of co2 for two minutes if he is prepared to go into a room full of radiation for two minutes
6395524 even the most optimistic proponents of carbon capture and storage doubt it will be a serious alternative much before 2020 and by then both the physical and the political climate may look rather different

6395566 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone
6395567 our countrys greatest military asset is the men and women who wear the uniform of the united states when we do send our men and women into harms way we must also clearly define the mission prescribe concrete political and military objectives seek out advice of our military commanders evaluate the intelligence plan accordingly and ensure that our troops have the resources support and equipment they need to protect themselves and fulfill their mission
6395568 we must build a world free of unnecessary barriers stereotypes and discrimination policies must be developed attitudes must be shaped and buildings and organizations must be designed to ensure that everyone has a chance to get the education they need and live independently as full citizens in their communities
6395569 the cost of our debt is one of the fastest growing expenses in the federal budget this rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy robbing our cities and states of critical investments in infrastructure like bridges ports and levees robbing our families and our children of critical investments in education and health care reform robbing our seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on if washington were serious about honest tax relief in this country wed see an effort to reduce our national debt by returning to responsible fiscal policies
6395570 i believe that every american has the right to affordable health care i believe that the millions of americans who cant take their children to a doctor when they get sick have that right we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates its time to bring together businesses the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis and its time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while theyll get a seat at the table they dont get to buy every chair
6395571 we are at that critical and urgent moment if washington continues policies that work against americas family farmers our rural communities will fall further behind and so will america but if we reject the politics that has shut ordinary folks out we can create a new story for rural america the dreams of rural americans are familiar to all americans to make a good living to raise a healthy and secure family and to leave our children a future of opportunity its time for real leadership for rural america to extend that american dream thats the dream of opportunity that ive spent my life fighting for and thats what our rural agenda will do
6395572 your own story and the american story are not separate they are shared and they will both be enriched if we stand up together and answer a new call to service to meet the challenges of our new century i wont just ask for your vote as a candidate i will ask for your service and your active citizenship when i am president of the united states this will not be a call issued in one speech or program this will be a cause of my presidency
6395573 let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age lets set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed lets recruit a new army of teachers and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability lets make college more affordable and lets invest in scientific research and lets lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across america

6395579 san francisco regains control of city network after mayors visit
6395580 consider a two lane road carrying both cars and trucks where the cars are moving faster on average at low traffic densities the cars have plenty of space to overtake and can easily pass the trucks as the traffic density increases drivers find it more difficult to overtake because other vehicles are in the way however evidence from simulations and real traffic flows shows that at a critical density of traffic the obstruction to lane changing begins to have a beneficial effect because drivers tend to stay in one lane they disturb the flow of traffic less leading to a higher total throughput of vehicles
6395581 lights can do a better job helbing and l mmer have found if they are given some simple operating rules and left to organise their own solution
6395582 whats more the scheme eliminates other irritating problems that afflict traditional traffic control at quiet times drivers typically have to wait far longer than is really necessary at intersections because the lights schedules are designed to serve a large number of vehicles and in the middle of the night lights keep stopping cars even when there is no need the self organising traffic scheme eliminates these problems because the lights remain responsive to local demands for instance sensing an approaching car and changing to green to let it through
6395583 town planners are beginning to look at self organising lights as a practical solution to looming traffic congestion
6395584 weve found significant reductions in waiting times and fuel consumption and we can also accelerate public transport
6395585 the wider lesson is that we just cant trust our intuition when it comes to the super complex systems that we depend on today we may never learn exactly how to control these systems in the traditional fashion and the best way to cope may be by learning new principles for letting them manage themselves
6395586 all of the reports and rumors and chatter it really ought to be ignored
6395587 is based on conditions on the ground and obamas though theyre both 16 months
6395588 time will tell but the al maliki comments about a timetable is very close to a game changing event that was incredibly damaging to mccain because it neutralized one of obamas biggest liabilities

6395645 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6395646 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6395647 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6395648 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6395649 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6395650 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6395651 there is no comparison between the civil war and now
6395652 this is just a small group with no political reason to justify what they are doing we cannot reconcile with them the government needs to be firm and to reorganize its military and intelligence agencies
6395653 theyre using tactics from iraq and afghanistan theyre using the internet for recruiting and cell phones to explode bombs
6395654 theyre told by the government that a military crackdown is under way yet they cant believe what theyre seeing they say reconciliation attempts have done nothing theyre scared that the war of the 1990s will come back
6395655 even if this group is only 100 or 200 strong they can cause great damage and fear with five or 10 suicide bombers we have to ask why in 2008 some of our young people are going into these radical groups
6395656 these terrorist gangs are seeking through attacks against civilians to loosen the net closing around them as security forces drive them to the wall
6395657 but the whole civil society and politicians in all cities are condemning these acts which we think have links to international terrorists
6395658 these small groups have nothing to do with algerian politics
6395659 we will have gone through yet another metamorphosis toward our core purpose of creating environments for respectful personal and engaging communications with an unwavering goal of leading the world into the preference marketing era there will of course be some companies who object to the new law but we see yesterdays ruling as an exciting step forward in the voice marketing industry and one that consumers and marketers can greatly benefit from alike express consent will change the industry in a positive way for good
6395660 but more than the financial penalty theres the loss of customer trust respect and loyalty you cant put a price on that

6395672 this is part of a family that had farmed land here for years
6395673 all of a sudden were instructing someone they have to sell that land and that seems a bit ridiculous to me at this point
6395674 i know they have to have laws in regard to restrictions and i respect that but just in this case this farm is no threat to anyone
6395675 i wanted to keep the family farm for sentimental value my grandfather was an original homesteader in 1909 so the farm has been in the family for 99 years before my mom passed away she wanted the farm to go to my sister and myself and then to the grandchildren
6395676 my grandfather he was not a quitter he showed the saskatchewan spirit to go forward and thats what i sort of want to hang onto
6395677 i think the first thing im going to tell them to start when you make a decision use common sense they have exemptions they can make and in this case should have been i feel personally as a farmer from the past should have been used
6395678 i think common sense tells you this isnt something that threatens our way of life on the family farm
6395679 we dont want to open it up to the point where all of a sudden theres corporations from all over the world owning big blocks of land here as a farmer i think that would hinder my business
6395680 if those figures were accurate there needs to be mass graves where are those graves
6395681 we are saying that we will not hand over any sudanese citizens to anyone for prosecution abroad

6395684 you really have to appreciate what the services are doing at the moment

6395686 the work you are doing here is vital i say that to your comrades in europe because there are soldiers from the whole of europe here
6395687 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
6395688 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6395689 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6395690 unless we do that pay more attention we will continue to suffer

6395731 i caution that our fellow mps must know that the union comprises two parts all of us have a profound interest in it but im surprised by our colleagues claim that they are sidelined
6395732 this is enough to prove that the pm has authority on the two sides of the union and that dr mwakyembe was right and it is they who are supposed to apologise
6395733 the worst thing about this is that it is the mps who under article 65 of the constitution swore to protect the constitution are the ones abusing it

6395735 i really think he is the most qualified democrat in the race for president
6395736 his track record is exceptional hes done a fine job as governor and was re elected with around 70 percent of the vote
6395737 if a democrat carries new mexico colorado and nevada we dont need ohio or florida to win richardson is very popular throughout the southwest and stands the best chance of being able to do that
6395738 i was disappointed to hear about the presidents threat to veto the washington dc appropriations bill because of the domestic partner registry
6395739 it is particularly sad that the president would choose to issue this threat during pride month which should be a celebration of glbt americans contributions to our nation as well as a celebration of the strides our nation has made towards full equality

6395741 i dont like those formulae that tell you there have to be eight offensive linemen and five wide receivers and so forth
6395742 i have always felt you have to keep the 53 best players you have and the rest will sort of take care of itself
6395743 there is still a way to go in the preseason and anything such as injuries can happen i am convinced that we will keep the best players

6395955 w hrend die rzte sich um den kranken k rper k mmern nehmen wir uns geist und seele an wir wollen den menschen auch die angst nehmen damit der mensch schneller genesen kann

6395972 oh lord i know charles is going to be king one day but if only he could be genius at something
6395973 i dont care what he does as long as hes happy
6395974 look just give the second year a chance after that ill back you to the hilt in becoming a hairdresser
6395975 ryan was feeling really low after the match but i thought he had a fantastic debut up until the sending off
6395976 it was a harsh decision and the referee i suppose could have turned a blind eye yes there was contact after he came across the player but there was cover
6395977 hell just have to learn from the experience and its a really tough lesson he should be very proud of his performance as he handled himself very well on a difficult stage
6395978 the lad up until the sending off came through his debut with flying colours handled himself well looked composed and i can tell you he will get better and yes could follow the example set by jonny evans
6395979 i was so proud of the boys especially after going down to 10 men
6395980 we had key players missing and still played exceptionally well david healy and steve davis have hardly played in pre season and in the league but they were brilliant
6395981 we defended well and it was great to come away with a clean sheet something we talked about before the match because we havent recorded one in a while
6395982 now its decision time for the manager especially after jonny evans performance last night what does he do
6395983 aaron should be fit but its going to be very difficult for jonny not to be in the side for the game against slovakia jonny is so versatile that he gives nigel so many options
6395984 hello john stack im fine although i only got in from the office about twenty minutes ago were preparing something for a very demanding client and even when youre a partner your colleagues expect you to stick around into the evening

6396016 push up the bottom line and cost out the differentials no i told fenella to adjust her bloombergs yep theyve raised the bar to two percent collateral what i dont care what quintin said can you wire through the spreadsheets uh b bye bye
6396017 theyve given me three months until the end of february sounds a bit like a cancer prognosis
6396018 i think ill just have to shut the gallery after the march show and sell what stock i have at auction probably at a loss having a gallery in london requires a lot of financial backing these days and thats been my problem im also bloody fed up with the commute
6396019 but all that time and effort youve put into it jack
6396020 at least i havent got a mortgage to worry about all i need to do is cover food and bills
6396021 it wouldve been different if linda and bryony were still around
6396022 youd have fought for it tooth and nail it wouldve been different
6396023 thats the bloody awful part thats the awful part why do you always sound so bitter when you talk about linda rather than sad is it just an american thing
6396024 its a life thing its a life thing im not bitter im bloody angry
6396025 ill have a half of orange and lemonade ive got the company beamer in the car park
6396026 you remember when we used to come here in the school holidays and drink snakebites underage
6396027 you know i was telling you id kind of met someone ive got a date with her tonight in stroud
6396028 like the sexy nicola six in that martin amis novel
6396029 quite a lot like her actually but without the darts
6396030 you look very nice sorry im a bit late our chauffeur is waiting
6396031 dyou think i might be a bit overdressed for il trovatore
6396032 the good citizens of stroud wont know whats hit em youll knock em dead
6396033 you look very smart yourself have you come from a business meeting or something
6396034 a bottle of your best red please preferably light and fruity hows the old man
6396035 when i was a child he used to do odd jobs for my parents
6396036 a small village can be a big place in this country
6396037 i went away to university to study law in edinburgh and worked as a junior in a practice for about four years in bristol but later on my husband my boyfriend as he was then wanted to settle down around here id introduced him to the area he was a bit like you worked in london but came back at weekends and one or two evenings during the week
6396038 what did he die of you mean lets stick to plain english it was cancer a brain tumour at forty one
6396039 just over three years ago he was eight years older than me
6396040 you dont want to talk about your wife do you
6396041 you probably know the story her name was linda our marriage had stopped working it was my fault perhaps id been drinking a little too much work pressure and all that crap she was angry with me and drove our daughter away on christmas day the year before last thats how it happened
6396042 i suppose all people like us can do is to try and get on with living
6396043 oh family law mostly things like wills and conveyancing with the odd divorce settlement thrown in sometimes ive never been hugely ambitious about developing my practice ive always thought of being a solicitor more as a job that uses my brain than as a career with some great outcome just over the horizon
6396044 you mustve been pretty academic to get into law at university your grades mustve meant something in the eighties or whenever it was
6396045 is that a leading question by any chance im thirty six if youre asking and was an a grade kind of girl
6396046 i was never that keen on academic work i just felt that i should at least try to go to university to reward my parents for all the school fees they paid
6396047 i didnt think private schools were such a big thing in the states
6396048 theyre not that common but i went to public school here when my parents moved over for work
6396049 oh im sure youve never heard of it its a minor one called st botolphs academy just outside taunton
6396050 there are so many minor ones arent there i went to a good old fashioned girls high school
6396051 was it like this on your first day of college i seem to remember all we did was talk about where we went to school and what a level grades we got
6396052 not being one to scare the children ive had the odd man ask me out on a date but nothing too serious it has always felt a bit soon to get serious with someone again
6396053 and i agree about you not scaring the horses for the record
6396054 oh i dont know about horses i might scare them witless i only guaranteed that i wouldnt make children run for the hills
6396055 no one at all in a year and a half to help you through your grief
6396056 im not so sure that being on your own is what nature intended ive never felt so lonely
6396057 make us a drink theyre on the sideboard in the kitchen

6396092 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6396093 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6396094 the fact that theyre even taking this close a look at this issue is good news in my mind because theyve been away from the fresh water scene for so long
6396095 politics is not just about issues it is a metaphorical test of strength if a man will not get immediately if quietly angry and fight back when his patriotism is attacked why should we trust him to defend the country and if he wont punch back by explaining clearly why his approach to foreign policy is actually tougher and smarter why mccains is thoughtless and reckless why would we think he is better to be commander in chief

6396102 i would have preferred the race to have been at york but at least were running
6396103 i dont know what price flashmans papers is but he wouldnt be a million miles behind kingsgate native
6396104 if kingsgate native got a bad run through the race and flashmans papers got a good run then it wouldnt be the biggest surprise in the world to see flashmans papers beat him
6396105 i think they both want decent ground ideally and it looks like we could get that at newmarket
6396106 michita has been in good form since royal ascot and the ground should be ideal for her at newmarket
6396107 dar re mi handles most ground and probably would have been fine at york as she won on soft ground at deauville last time
6396108 she has come out of the race in good shape but obviously i think passage of time and lush lushes set the standard on form

6396167 when others are doing it giving link to rcom we will also do it we have no choice we always follow trais directives giving interconnection to others is a rule for us why is this a big issue in fact there is no issue here we have been very liberal with giving link to other players
6396168 we are happy that we are moving towards a resolution under the good offices of trai on the matter in a fair and equitable manner since there seems to be all round efforts to resolve the issue there is no need of going to tdsat over the matter
6396169 our sales will not be affected by the launch of iphone in the country there are different segments of consumers whose needs are different
6396170 there is a global trend towards touchscreen handsets and we have a strong line up available which we are in the process of introducing globally and in india
6396171 besides higher prices for gasoline price increases for other energy components such as fuel oil and other fuels and electricity rose sharply in newfoundland and labrador prince edward island and nova scotia in the 12 months to july
6396172 the rise in these energy components largely accounted for the growth in consumer prices posted in these province
6396173 the death toll is close to 40 and there are about 60 wounded many of them in critical condition
6396174 there were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help
6396175 many of the wounded were either without legs or hands i could see body parts hanging on trees
6396176 the 50 000 of course it is an attempt to compensate partially for the lost compensation and lost wages but it is not just a wage compensation
6396177 this goes to cover their medical their dental their mental health needs
6396178 there is no way to recapture the years and there is no way to compensate for what these men and sometimes women lose in their lives
6396179 the six companies have been given 13 months to find appropriate locations to build new atomic power plants construction of the plants will start after deciding their locations
6396180 while the core to improving lunchtime choices for scotlands teenagers is about supporting them with the information about good food and healthy eating the scottish government and local councils have to play their part as well
6396181 these young people are consumers who are making their own decisions
6396182 they will only stay in school if whats on offer there in terms of both the food and the lunchtime environment is better than whats on offer outside
6396183 the out to lunch report suggests the obesity time bomb has still not been defused for many young scots but it is not something that schools or parents can do on their own
6396184 beyond the school gate we acknowledge the challenge posed by chip vans
6396185 however some local authorities east renfrewshire and west dunbartonshire and more recently renfrewshire and falkirk council have taken steps to prevent them trading near schools at lunchtime
6396186 long known for a preference to do everything in house we began to seek out innovation from any and all sources innovation is all about connections so we get everyone we can involved p amp gers past and present customers suppliers even competitors the more connections the more ideas the more ideas the more solutions
6396187 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan
6396188 without that information bm mohamed will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces given the confessions made by him in bagram and guant namo bay in 2004
6396189 it is a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained under torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used in evidence in trial
6396190 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6396191 research has shown that good relationships and good sex education can raise the age that young people first try out sexual activity
6396192 most young people want to hear the facts from their parents or carers and be able to talk with them about body changes feelings and boyfriends or girlfriends
6396193 yet many parents and carers feel embarrassed or are not sure what to say
6396194 the speakeasy course was specially developed for those parents and carers to help them improve their communication skills with children and young people and to give them more confidence
6396195 wat mensen een beetje over het hoofd hebben gezien is dat dat hele erge afsmelten van vorig jaar voor een deel door een abnormale weersituatie is veroorzaakt je kunt niet zomaar veronderstellen dat die weersituatie zich het volgende jaar weer voordoet
6396196 het is nog steeds mogelijk dat de noordpool deze zomer ijsvrij wordt maar niet erg waarschijnlijk
6396197 door de winden kan dat ijs een bepaalde kant opgeblazen worden en dan kun je dus al een ijsvrije noordpool hebben terwijl er nog een redelijke hoeveelheid ijs in de noordelijke ijszee ligt dat hebben we vorig jaar ook gezien dat het echt n kant op werd gestuwd als er nog iets minder ijs ligt en het wordt een bepaalde kant opgestuwd dan kun je al snel een ijsvrije noordpool hebben en het zou me niet verbazen als dat binnen tien jaar gebeurt
6396198 these reports show the most comprehensive picture of nhs dentistry to date under the new contractual arrangements
6396199 as a qualified dentist myself it is interesting to see how a typical course of dental treatment is changing
6396200 our challenge is encouraging people to visit their dentist for regular check ups even if they feel they dont need to
6396201 there is also a perception amongst the public that there is a growing lack of nhs dentists and these latest statistics prove that there is actually more and more nhs dentistry services opening around the country
6396202 those that are able to access care are confronted with a system that discourages modern preventive care by placing targets rather than patients at its heart
6396203 the apparent change in treatment patterns is also of concern and requires further investigation so that the impact of the new contract is fully understood
6396204 ministers need to stop dithering admit that their new dental contract has been a complete failure and take action to make good their pledge to give everyone access to an nhs dentist
6396205 palliative care should be an integral part of the support given to patients and their families and carers during the last months days and hours of their lives
6396206 in many areas of scotland the voluntary sector and the health service provide excellent and much appreciated care but access to good quality palliative care varies across the country
6396207 there are many examples across the country of nhs boards and the voluntary sector working together to improve services
6396208 this is a process that is already under way but theres no doubt we have to accelerate that progress

6396222 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
6396223 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6396224 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
6396225 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
6396226 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years alot of that was orchestrated through her management rebel one it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen a lot of the money rihanna made through her endorsements between covergirl cosmetics samsung notice that majority of rihannas videos have a cell phone in it
6396227 after the release of rihanna and teairra mari def jam had intention to drop both acts because their album sales were not successful
6396228 then came for the repackaging of her album good girl gone bad which is called good girl gone bad reloaded that entire project was funded through rihannas money take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account
6396229 all of it was spent on making her as big as she is now its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name

6396312 daniel bell heeft duizenden mensen ge nspireerd en toch klinkt niemand zoals hem
6396313 ik kan nu wel zeggen dat het bijzonder is dat de organisatie ons heeft gevraagd maar het is iets anders gegaan isis heeft op het festival haar eigen podium all is one zij besloot om ons een eigen podium te geven
6396314 steve rachmad heeft mij zonder twijfel het meest be nvloed toen ik een jaar of zestien was raakte ik met hem aan de praat op een feestje waar hij draaide twee uur lang hebben we met elkaar gesproken daarna hebben we contact gehouden ik was in die tijd nog heel erg van de techno we spraken veel over muziek steve heeft me het draaien bijgebracht het contact is nu wel minder ik ben met mijn muziek een andere kant op gegaan aanvankelijk richting deephouse en disco maar tegenwoordig draai ik alle muziek die ik goed genoeg acht in techno alleen vind ik geen bevrediging meer deze set van rachmad komt uit de tijd dat we elkaar leerden kennen
6396315 2003 was voor mij een frustrerende periode ik kwam vast te zitten met techno in deze periode moest het allemaal rustiger aan minimal kwam op en iedereen ging daar in mee ik niet ik ben niet zo flexibel antal wees mij in die periode de weg naar de oudere dance als wave en disco disco is de moeder van de housemuziek sta je daar open voor dan kun je zoveel toelaten in je sets tot aan afrikaanse ritmes antal draait van alles door elkaar maar heeft altijd n stabiele factor kwaliteit
6396316 het is onzin dat al die elektronische muziek uit berlijn de naam minimal draagt het gevoel is er uit gehaald het tempo ligt laag en het zit vol met kliks en klaks maar dat heeft niets met minimal te maken dbx is daniel bell samen met robert hood is hij de grondlegger van het principe minimalisme in de techno het is zo simpel een synth een kickdrum en hihats en toch klinkt het rete funky daniel bell heeft duizenden mensen ge nspireerd en toch klinkt niemand zoals hij de avond voor dbx draaide ik zelf op 5 days off ik was kapot die zondag en ben toen niet gaan kijken daar heb ik enorme spijt van in whitenoise hoor je hoe hij zijn platen verwerkt tot nieuwe eigentijdse arrangementen zo goed de gedachte dat ik dit nooit live zal meemaken maakt het nog erger het was een eenmalige tour
6396317 larry heard een boven getalenteerde producer zijn muziek is vrij simpel maar toch weet hij er zoveel gevoel in te leggen als dj weet hij dat niveau niet te bereiken toch behoort zijn set tot mijn favorieten ik was erbij aan het einde van de avond was er een kleine club mensen over hij zong toen live een nummer mee dat deed hij heel emotioneel dat zag ik aan de uitdrukking op zijn gezicht een bijzonder moment
6396318 de lugubere muziek van coil is een vreemde eend in de bijt coil draai ik als ik zin heb in iets wat zwaar op de maag ligt ik heb een liefde voor vreemde niet zo gezellige muziek ietwat droevige muziek heeft pas echt de kracht iets bij me te doen en dat doet coil

6396330 i sent out one of those letters just a few months ago for the first time i wrote an honest letter which i prayed over and had peace about despite my efforts it seemed to make the elderly cringe and the relatives scowl my pastor received some phone calls and i got a little talking to from the mother
6396331 how many will be handled through involuntary layoffs depends on attrition and what positions are not filled
6396332 with production down and customer demand down for the programs we support our reaction entails that we reduce our u s workforce hourly and salaried and resizing our footprint
6396333 we instituted that with our agreement with the uaw buyouts when over 2 000 accepted fewer hourly people mean we also have a need for fewer salaried people as well
6396334 he said if john is too good for my money ill give it to presumptive democratic nominee barack obama

6396348 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6396349 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6396350 they wanted to tell the next generation to be careful to avoid the disease and to remember those who died from the illness
6396351 some of the parents were angry when their children told them about the condoms
6396352 but its an integral part of the message to the next generation that says protect yourself from this disease and we believe that message will be appreciated by the children of the future
6396353 its amazing how many times youre casually in the sun without realizing it all the freckles and leathery skin thats a result of cumulative sun damage amp sun exposure there are a lot of golfers tennis players gardeners and whole lot of other people that simply wont use a topical for whatever reason which makes the sunpill a timely option for year round protection
6396354 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mika ls versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mika l has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6396355 if you extrapolate these figures through to the third quarter youre probably looking at stagnation of gdp gross domestic product this is not a harbinger of imminent upturn
6396356 nothing points to a fundamental turnaround i think theres been a spillover effect from italy spain and now germany and france has followed suit

6396361 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents

6396388 the other suppliers on the automotive side theyre somewhat diverse and they seem to be doing well

6396401 alles is begonnen op een familiefeestje met nieuwjaar in 1996
6396402 er werden allerlei plannen en goede voornemens gemaakt en er gingen er veel van de familie meestappen in de dodentocht toen het uiteindelijk zover was ben ik dat jaar als enige vertrokken op wat voor mij een ontdekkingstocht was de rest die zijn dan uiteindelijk later gevolgd
6396403 to qualify for the championships you had to be under 28 on january 1 this year but my birthday is on december 8 so i just missed out
6396404 they brought in the age limit to stop people continuously enrolling on courses so they could compete usually in america where student sport is huge
6396405 its gutting because i was in with a real chance of a medal
6396406 its been so windy its made training and competing really difficult the weather has played a big role in what i can do normally by this stage in the season id be using an 11m cable but you cant do it when the water is so rough it is frustrating
6396407 it was horrendously windy at both it was gale force at the british championships and it was raining too so it wasnt very pleasant for anyone
6396408 but it was fantastic to retain the title and it made up for missing out at the british open when boot problems meant i finished fifth all in all its been a good season i just wish the weather was better
6396409 ill be very frank vietnam divided families divided people it was a terrible time of sic our country people didnt know one another since then ill be very frank ayers has been in the forefront of a lot of education issues and helping us in public schools and things like that
6396410 its really unfortunate theyre friends so what people do make mistakes in the past you move on this is a new century a new time he reflects back and hes been making a strong contribution to our community
6396411 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6396412 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6396413 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6396414 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6396415 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6396416 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
6396417 i think they are getting there on the top and its going to be extremely difficult to change that
6396418 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
6396419 they have a generation that is already ok and ready for london 2012
6396420 i expect more international athletes got really frightened and scared about using doping
6396421 we are making progress its becoming far more difficult to cheat than it was before
6396422 its not pleasant to think that about 25 kilometers from sochi there is a potential region of instability in abkhazia
6396423 the russians have pledged total security and told us we should not be concerned about that i could only hope these territorial conflicts can be solved as soon possible thats the work of the politicians
6396424 i would expect all of them to be back and more

6396432 its way too early to talk about this being a viable product category
6396433 im not sure how much of a market there is for them particularly with subnotebooks like macbook air with larger keyboards and displays getting thinner and lighter and you can get some real work done on say an iphone or a nokia e series smart phone
6396434 the eee pc has successfully explored user segments that have been ignored by other notebook vendors
6396435 for example a lot of kids use their parents notebooks but they are just too heavy to carry to school but at two pounds kids can easily put ultraportables in their backpacks
6396436 netbooks are for communicating with e mail and im browsing and things like media streaming very basic things
6396437 but theyre not just about the internet we use the term mini notebook
6396438 it seems to be more a case of sentiment than actual changes in the underlying commodities
6396439 for the energy stocks some of the big cap higher quality producers have fallen a lot relative to the price of oil and a lot of them look pretty good here
6396440 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything i dont anticipate they will do that

6396444 id say a hundred bucks it cant be cheap for the gas and salt itd have to be pretty expensive
6396445 her husband had a very well known dress shop near the earle theatre
6396446 just to see the things that they didnt have and it made me think about all the things that i cry about
6396447 its not about what i want its about what i need and i see over there some of them dont even have what they need
6396448 of a reach and expanse never before seen in michigan constitutional initiatives
6396449 its a pretty mixed bag this morning but the banks and financials are down in line with global markets
6396450 we really need to change the way we do business
6396451 i found it quite easy because ive been reading science books for a long time before i did the course
6396452 i pretty much knew a lot of it already so i didnt have to revise a lot
6396453 i was a little bit nervous and i was quite excited especially to get my results
6396454 i thought i could just sit it and see what happened but when it was over i thought i have to get a good result
6396455 im so relieved and the fact that we are all twins and are able to share this success together makes it more special
6396456 we are not that competitive but we support each other if one of us is doing revision then the other feels obliged to do the same
6396457 the social stress and the educational stress of being at school made me pass out and it was very difficult for me so leaving school was the right thing for me to do
6396458 accipio has meant i have been able to carry on with my learning and get over this difficult time

6396466 kenyataan samsiah bercanggah dengan fakta dan beliau cuba mengelirukan rakyat dengan mengaitkan penahanan dibuat di sebuah hotel bagi menguatkan teori rasuah seks yang telah beliau bersama umno rancang
6396467 ini adalah satu konspirasi yang dirancang oleh umno perak terhadap kerajaan pakatan rakyat negeri perak

6396471 no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time
6396472 finally it appears all the hard work thats been done is starting to pay off
6396473 and we have had a real community response to many of our initiatives
6396474 i really do believe that in terms of longarm we are far ahead of the rest of the province in terms of joint forces initiatives and that has had a serious impact on crime for sure
6396475 sometimes its a little frustrating because you dont see the fruits of your labours immediately but it does appear by the results of this study that we are on the right track
6396476 i really think our members whether youre talking about the crime unit the detectives or the members on the road are really putting a dent in crime
6396477 there are many places in the province where you have to wait far longer
6396478 my emotions were so up and down right now i think im mostly in shock i really dont have to words to describe everything involved here mostly i guess im very proud im so proud of travis and im so proud of port alberni
6396479 i dont know that something like this has ever happened with a community in canada before wrestling is a big part of the community it has a long history travis is the first olympian but it goes back its like a lot of small towns in canada everybody knows everybody they made this really special
6396480 it started in 1992 when travis was 12 years old i was his school principal he was a pretty good little hockey player but i suggested wrestling might be his forte later that year he watched jeff thue wrestle for canada in barcelona and told his mom he was going to make it to the olympics sixteen years later here we all are
6396481 he came back one day and told me he just couldnt go on i asked him if the dream was still alive he said yes so i told him well make it happen
6396482 i know after all of this travis is going to spend a lot of time giving back to the community
6396483 i could hear them all i knew the whole town would be watching
6396484 i know it was a pretty excruciating experience i put them through i had the opportunity to close out each one
6396485 i hope they all understand they made a small town in canada special and i hope other small towns in canada are inspired by this story
6396486 en un accidente de estas caracter sticas es muy dif cil la identificaci n
6396487 mega is acting as a facilitator of the project as part of our mandate to attract new investment into the province
6396488 we are still in the process of finding suitable investors to start the project
6396489 the facility will probably be built to international standards and will be able to host national and international meetings like the one in durban
6396490 conferences and banquets as well as concerts and selected indoor sporting events will also be accommodated not just for the world cup but beyond that
6396491 muitas pessoas ficaram feridas e acredita se que o n mero de v timas fatais ir subir
6396492 we should all be proud as this agreement is a legacy of action that we can in all the years and decades point to as a legacy of life
6396493 it is a legacy of life because it talks to the livelihood of people as it focuses on the economic development of the areas in and around our mines
6396494 while we rightfully applaud ourselves for coming this far we should be mindful of the fact that in some very real sense the journey is only now beginning
6396495 it is the implementation of the agreement which shall determine the value of the paper it is written on and the ink with which it is written
6396496 i am particularly pleased that even as we sign the agreement there are already projects associated with it in the pipeline
6396497 we therefore start on a very auspicious note and it is said that a journey of success must begin on a positive note indeed
6396498 our planned partnership with the three tiers of government presents an enormous range of potential benefits to communities
6396499 its amazing how many times youre casually in the sun without realizing it all the freckles and leathery skin thats a result of cumulative sun damage amp sun exposure there are a lot of golfers tennis players gardeners and whole lot of other people that simply wont use a topical for whatever reason which makes the sunpill a timely option for year round protection

6396509 we do have another case right now under investigation but we cant confirm its linked to the provincial outbreak
6396510 the general information we have received is this production line as far as we know doesnt do the little packages you get at the local grocery store
6396511 these products have been distributed nationally primarily to food service institutions such as restaurants hospitals and nursing homes
6396512 these products may also be sold at retail and deli counters

6396518 naarmate er meer landen de enum technologie operationeel hebben wordt het steeds interessanter voor verschillende partijen om applicaties te gaan ontwikkelen als het maar een paar landen zijn dan is het bijna niet de moeite om daar tijd en geld in te steken
6396519 het is interessant om het in de gaten te houden maar het is nog in een stadium dat we kijken wat er gebeurt op het moment dat je denkt dat het momentum krijgt dan stap je er in
6396520 nineteen of the 27 deaths since wednesday were reported from the central district of sitapur
6396521 more than 100 people have died in 11 districts across the state in the torrential rains over the past five days
6396522 hes taken a really serious turn for the worse just now
6396523 the vets have had a look they have said hes having breathing difficulties his flippers are at an unusual angle hes not going to last much longer you should put him down
6396524 to hold it here and feed it and then somehow get it to antarctica where it would learn to feed on krill is simply impossible
6396525 and i think it is often the kindest the most humane thing to do is to euthanize the animal and prevent it just suffering a very long protracted starvation and death
6396526 the whole issues been quite harrowing not only for our staff but for the community in general where people have really been concerned about this whale

6396546 this will give us a little added strength on the streets it works out pretty well
6396547 we do this enforcement on our own but the extra money provides some additional officers
6396548 unfortunately for us this is a population that has proven resistant to run of the mill public service campaigns
6396549 our research shows that this population is not fearful of hurting themselves at all but what is a stimulant to them is the fear of hurting someone else
6396550 we have folks who are just recalcitrant and arent going to wear them they just consider it a personal right to not wear a seat belt
6396551 i think we kind of feel that the responsibility has been passed onto our shoulders
6396552 theres so little of a classical music culture in the county
6396553 it hardly feels like were part of the community anymore
6396554 it would be so healthy just to give a sense of community
6396555 art would be a great way to make those connections
6396556 its a very very close family they do everything together
6396557 everyone knows where mr oei is hes not hiding out if he were indicted and told about it he would have gone in
6396558 the timing raises questions why the public spectacle mr oei is a responsible person and he intends to fight these charges because theyre wrong
6396559 well go straight to court and were going to pound this charge into the ground
6396560 we just feel very strongly that this is not someone who should be in the loudoun county school system
6396561 were examining the situation and deciding the course of action
6396562 at this point were weighing what options we have we have to make decisions that reflect everybodys best interests
6396563 if this was a matter of a photo that he possessed and maintained solely for the purpose of executing his job as vice principal we would not be interested in prosecuting him that is not the case
6396564 hes always been very pleasant the kids seem to respond well to him and the parents everyone likes him
6396565 we know if a district had all the money it needed it would take care of all this stuff itself
6396566 but this is reality there is not going to be enough money to take care of every school
6396567 its a well kept building but it looks like a typical school
6396568 environment does affect the way you feel about what you do
6396569 so i expect the new paint the new furnishings and the murals will just make the building a lot more attractive and make us feel good about being here

6396577 there is still a long way to go before our cinema accepts a turbaned sikh as a hero in any movie there is a widespread perception that sikh guys are ideally suited only for the roles of a comedian or of a truck driver or a taxi driver

6396579 the government has been looking at energy from the wrong end of the telescope
6396580 the scale of its failure to plan for britains energy security has been brought into sharp relief by the georgian crisis which underlines the risks of increasing dependence on foreign energy sources as north sea oil supplies run down
6396581 rather than use its period in office to reduce britains dependency on vulnerable supplies from unstable regions labour has dithered and flip flopped for over a decade instead of an energy policy we have a potential economic environmental and national security disaster waiting to happen
6396582 but we have an enormous opportunity to create real energy independence for the uk freeing ourselves from the shackles of foreign oil coal and gas
6396583 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking
6396584 thats why today i am setting out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
6396585 sony and apple are developing the next generation personal viewer the navigation video sunglasses these products will offer navigation features in full see through mode as well as video viewing with a clip on to block the background we expect that clip ons will be available to provide both see periphery views of the environment as well as full blocking of the environment to enable video immersion when desired this new versatile product generation will further accelerate acceptance and sales of personal viewers
6396586 i said it would be very strange for a book like that to be written without the stories of asian americans since we asian americans have been the largest minority group in fairfax county since 1990
6396587 we all had an appetite for history after this project
6396588 i thought it would be neat to learn the stories of the asian americans who make fairfax county home
6396589 because we are a minority in some respects we learn more about our religion than if you just grew up in it and didnt have to think about it
6396590 im delighted by how good mallika is at comedy i play the guy who tries to get her attention right under her husband paresh rawals nose
6396591 mallika is part of the theatre repertory in the film in fact all the principal actors mallika paresh who plays her husband kay kay menon and zakir hussain are part of the theatre group
6396592 im not part of the theatre group im a raw agent who needs to save the world by taking the help of the theatre company containing probably the worlds worst actors so the worlds worst theatre group is helping me to save the world
6396593 the only thing that this theatre group can do effectively on stage is a rendition of k asifs film mughall e azam thats where my salim act with anarkali comes in im only fantasising about being on stage with mallika
6396594 mallika had given the film her best shot and was expecting it to be a glorious follow up to pyaar ke side effects the poor show of the film has affected her shes no longer that confident of her next release maan gaye mughall e azam

6396597 such films should not be released anywhere in the world because they are not only against islamic teachings but are against the teachings of all heavenly religions

6396605 there are a number of usp 4 compatible systems without the capability to deliver mri data sets however there is no direct competitive commercial like for like instrumentation
6396606 by combining mri and a usp 4 compatible dissolution flow cell pharmasense could help pharmaceutical companies enhance tablet design and so improve drug efficacy and patient compliance
6396607 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6396608 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6396609 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6396610 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6396611 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6396612 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6396613 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6396614 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6396615 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6396616 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6396617 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6396618 deux hommes pied ont apparemment fait exploser les bombes quils portaient sur eux devant lusine au moment dun changement d quipe du personnel
6396619 au moins 45 personnes sont mortes selon un premier bilan et le nombre des bless s est tr s lev
6396620 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6396621 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6396622 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6396623 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6396624 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6396625 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6396626 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6396627 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6396628 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6396629 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6396630 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6396631 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6396632 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6396633 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6396634 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6396635 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6396636 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6396637 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6396638 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6396639 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6396640 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6396641 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6396642 we want to keep it usable the only way to do that is respect it as long as you do that the land will be there for you when you want it
6396643 why pay taxes to the county if you can contribute to a nonprofit that works toward that interest
6396644 it totally disrupts everything because you have to move a lot of people around in preparation
6396645 in the long run maybe it will be a good thing because it pushes other people to make sure theyre sharp in other positions but it doesnt allow you to progress as an offense
6396646 over the last 18 hours new information came to light in this case
6396647 we alerted the court to that and asked that the defendants bail be reduced to personal bail or no bail
6396648 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6396649 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6396650 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6396651 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6396652 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6396653 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6396654 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6396655 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6396656 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6396657 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6396658 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6396659 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6396660 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6396661 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6396662 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6396663 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6396664 who are open to doing something on the production side
6396665 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6396666 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6396667 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

6396681 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6396774 although the proportion of crude oil consumption produced in germany is comparatively small at 3 7 million tons domestic production covers just 3 percent of demand in germany any production on ones own doorstep increases supply security
6396775 they can be used to significantly prolong the life of existing older oil fields
6396776 wintershall is willing to invest more in the latest technologies in order to extend the production time of existing older fields
6396777 a higher average price for crude oil certainly has a positive impact on exploration and production activities in germany
6396778 projects become more economically viable and existing fields can be exploited for longer a higher market price also gives us the opportunity to invest more in germany for example in the use of state of the art technology

6397405 ive been playing for four years and ive seen him bowl like this he has moved way ahead when it comes to his fielding as well
6397406 he bowled really well in england too and its really good to have someone like him
6397407 it was a deceptive pitch with something in it for the fast bowlers
6397408 in tough hot and humid conditions they the pacemen bowled consistently but i dont think they will get such conditions in the coming matches
6397409 a win is a good habit to have you know you can deal with them you had a good fight in the game
6397410 you can now look into the eye of the opponents and say if we play good cricket we can definitely beat you
6397411 at the start of the series i said batting was the most important thing for us weve got to put runs on the board
6397412 we have good bowlers who can create opportunities but to do that we need to be consistent with the bat on a wicket like this you have to really struggle for your runs and work hard but we didnt dig in deep and fight really hard
6397413 after the first game he had a tight hamstring so we gave him a day off on tuesday

6397430 i think thats a fight thats definitely going to come off at some point
6397431 one hundred percent those two need to meet and settle this little dispute theyre having over whos better than who but theres been no guarantees that that fight will happen oct 4 opponents are still being discussed for kimbo

6397589 we got a tentative offer from translink for 19 a month but that involves zero transit improvement just as the transit is right now its not acceptable what the ksa will be looking at is bringing the price of the u pass up so its comparable with sfu and ubc and with that increase demand a number of service upgrades route changes things that will benefit the students in the kwantlen area
6397590 translinks policy really makes no sense from a fairness perspective it basically means that the poorer students who take transit the most have to pay the most for a u pass because theres little benefit from a business perspective for translink to offer a low cost u pass under this revenue neutral policy vcc students cant get a fair priced u pass because they already take transit a lot it basically comes down to a poverty tax
6397591 it can benefit more people by becoming standardized translink is hesitant to funnel more money into the program because it would end up costing more but i think the overall end results will be worth the extra money transportation is a major issue for the majority of students going to postsecondary institutions in b c its terribly discriminatory for students to be paying three times more than others do
6397592 it means that some students will be paying twice as much as other students
6397593 students generally support having a u pass because it means they can have unlimited access to transit throughout the lower mainland
6397594 its unfair because students will be paying different prices for the same service
6397595 we are also asking that the b c government provide dedicated funding for the expansion of the universal pass to all public postsecondary institutions in metro vancouver
6397596 if you go through a round of negotiations and translink says look we could give it to you at this price its like a lot of things that offer is good only for a period of time because very clearly as time goes by your cost of business goes up
6397597 offering a u pass to a school is not cost neutral to translink
6397598 our subsidy goes up because were not recovering 100 percent of costs
6397599 there will have to be a standardization of the price and its the only fair way to handle the matter
6397600 im endeavouring to get the people in the united states to take back our country and disempower the billionaires and the multinational corporations who are driving our foreign policy our international trade policy and our military policy and wrapping canada into it as well
6397601 they represent the most dangerous aspect of the global elite
6397602 canadians supply a lot of logistical support for our troops in iraq
6397603 in addition of course by taking a major role in afghanistan the canadian military has freed up american soldiers to play cannon fodder in iraq
6397604 my fear is that there will be a lot more deaths and arrests
6397605 my hope of course is that things will get better rather than worse but realistically the chinese government has shown no inclination towards relaxing the controls canada has got to speak up and on an official level make clear that we cant stand by and watch this happen
6397606 once the international communitys attention leaves tibet and leaves china after the olympics were afraid that the chinese government will use even more crackdowns and repression against the tibetan people

6397615 they will get married to more than one man and get pregnant without knowing who the father is
6397616 eventually due to despair hopelessness and fear they get exploited to commit such crimes as they become unwanted by society
6397617 people say they were displaced families from other neighborhoods who came to our area and tried to control it
6397618 the first thing they did was kill several people and leave the bodies in the traffic circle so everyone would see
6397619 they told the whole school that we must cover our faces and wear gloves
6397620 sometimes they would ask us are we good of course we said yes otherwise we would have been killed
6397621 the state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation
6397622 canada and malaysia as members of the united nations human rights council until 2009 collaborate on the promotion of universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms
6397623 im 100 percent convinced that if we dont turn the ship around his quality of life is going to be diminished
6397624 im concerned that if we dont get things done fast enough he might not even live out his natural life there are times when im talking that i choke up when i tell you that honestly thats how i feel
6397625 that is a very shortsighted view of the reality of the problems we face on the planet and how were going to solve them
6397626 if everybody did those things we would have an incremental impact but we would actually one year from now still have a net worse impact on the planet than we do today even if everyone adopted all those strategies
6397627 people are referring to the tipping point and the exponential impact of environmental devastation
6397628 we think just one more degree of temperature is going to have a small percentage impact but at some point one degree means x amount of glaciers melt which means x amount of impact on humans living near coastal areas and various other downstream and upstream impacts were seeing this stuff already
6397629 im very concerned it might not get better which makes some people say why bother
6397630 one of my motivations before starting this was to make stars out of people who are going the extra length to live environmentally responsible lifestyles when they have lots of choices that arent so environmentally responsible
6397631 its actually working i have to admit that im actually personally overwhelmed with the media attention and the general overall interest the competition has created around the world weve been covered in magazines and newspapers and web sites from malaysia to china all over the u s and canada
6397632 our system was set up to recognize your ip address on your computer
6397633 those rankings are done to incent companies and citizens to try to be competitive and to be rated higher because increasingly people are realizing there are tangible values to cities and companies that achieve those things
6397634 so my thought is why dont we do the same thing with people cities and companies and everything else are made of people
6397635 our system needs differentiation between colleges and universities because they serve different purposes
6397636 well be back having to overcorrect an imbalance that weve made that values university education over other kinds of education
6397637 in a government that has a tendency to centralize power in the premiers office were seeing the ministry trample on the autonomy of the institutions to govern themselves
6397638 and you simply do not want to enhance opportunities for political interference at our universities it is not conducive to an environment of free expression and innovation and discovery
6397639 the kind of world into which we are plunging headlong will bear little resemblance to the world we now know
6397640 if we are wise enough and fortunate enough to avoid global warfare and nuclear destruction it will be because we embrace the opportunities and responsibilities of this new world canadians will have a vital role to play
6397641 we are witnesses to the first act of a new scientific revolution
6397642 and each of us is a member of the cast if we are to prosper as a nation and as individuals we must strive to understand the meaning of the revolution as we plan for the years ahead
6397643 i think its going to take time and there are going to be skeptics
6397644 the way you measure the quality of an institution is the quality of its graduates and the quality of the faculty in time as employers hire graduates from kwantlen and capilano and they say by god theyre well prepared thats really going to build up the respect and reputation
6397645 i dont think gordon campbell understands how outpaced b c is becoming by ontario alberta and the northern states
6397646 i think he doesnt understand that ordinary middle class british columbians are having a hard time affording postsecondary and the cost of borrowing to pursue higher education and that in turn is contributing to declining enrollment
6397647 there have been seismic shifts in the demographic knowledge and economic landscapes
6397648 our job here is to be sure that the strengths of our universities colleges and institutes are reinforced while we discover new innovations that will help shape the learning landscape of the future we want a learning landscape that is as rich and diverse as this great province

6397651 if people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene we want to make sure weve got people who stand in front of them with obama signs
6397652 clinton spokesperson kathleen strand emphasized the team would not seek to convince delegates to vote for the former first lady but would hand out clinton signs to supporters who requested them
6397653 theres as much likelihood of that happening as there being commercial space flights
6397654 it was both fun and horrible its like having a girlfriend that you have always been in love with and youll always be in love with but you dont quite get along with youre still in love with her and every time you get together you end up throwing food at each other
6397655 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6397656 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6397657 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6397658 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6397659 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6397660 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6397661 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6397662 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6397663 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6397664 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6397665 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6397666 de plannen moeten nog concreet gemaakt worden maar we zijn bezig om een aantal formats in de markt te zetten voor online videos waarbij ook de content word geleverd de nieuwe media afdeling van ilse media gaat hier eventueel gebruik van maken
6397667 were not going into the ad network business so to speak
6397668 we look at how we enable the existing players to have a better digital advertising opportunity
6397669 the tailoring of content and media to individuals should apply to all aspects of advertising not just the bottom of the funnel
6397670 we operate in unit based media economy where everyone gets the same content and sees the same ad were moving to an impression based economy well provide the platform that will enable the industry to do that and as we introduce those sorts of services well charge for them

6397674 they bring people on humanitarian grounds but they load them with debt
6397675 for refugee claimants its a little bit easier because they probably lived in a city and they managed to get here
6397676 but government assisted refugees they have probably spent 10 or more years in a refugee camp and conditions there are enforced poverty and dependence so theyre moving into a completely different and modern urban environment like a large city in a western country and the language is different theyre just lost

6397696 the fees that we have to charge parents are often prohibitive and subsidies are hard to access
6397697 parents cant get child care spaces and even if they can theyre shocked at the cost
6397698 i dont think theres any coordination whatsoever that begs a system but there isnt one
6397699 it is inappropriate to use classroom space in vancouver schools for child care programs
6397700 classrooms as designated and maintained by the ministry cannot be used for childcare programs within the vancouver school district
6397701 we may be doing our best but we may also be creatures of our own conventional thinking
6397702 theres a lot of not quite sure what to do about school age care
6397703 up until a couple of weeks ago it was the determination of this government to cause districts to get rid of empty space
6397704 i can only speak to the record weve had since 2001
6397705 weve clearly been a leader across the country in early childhood education
6397706 this is the first government in the country that had a designated minister for early learning
6397707 practically the school district doesnt have the wherewithal to do it on our own
6397708 schools are public assets and should be used in partnership with the community
6397709 their rhetoric and their funding have always been in contradiction
6397710 we do need to better serve families who need different options and i hope this is a step in the right direction

6397739 washington forgotten but not gone the waste from more than 100 nuclear reactors that the federal government was supposed to start accepting for burial 10 years ago is still at the reactor sites at least 20 years behind schedule but it is making itself felt in the federal budget with court orders and settlements the federal government has already paid the utilities 342 million but is virtually certain to pay a total of at least 7 billion in the next few years and probably over 11 billion government officials said the industry said the total could reach 35 billion the payments come from an obscure and poorly understood government account that requires no new congressional appropriations and will balloon in size experts said the damage number is rising if the repository that the government is trying to develop at yucca mountain near las vegas could start accepting waste at the date now officially projected in 2017 the damages would run about 7 billion according to edward f sproat iii director of the office of civilian radioactive waste management if the repository opens in 2020 the damages would come to about 11 billion he said and for each year beyond that about 500 million more the industry says the total could reach 35 billion the rate payer has paid for it said michael bauser the associate general counsel of the nuclear energy institute the industrys trade group the department of energy hasnt done it and now the taxpayer is paying for it a second time the government now pays the damages out of general revenues the government is also running up extra expenses on its own wastes some of the waste that is supposed to go to yucca left over from nuclear weapons production is sitting in storage that is expensive to maintain each reactor typically creates about 20 tons of waste a year which is approximately two new casks at roughly 1 million each if a repository or interim site opened clearing the backlog would take decades experts say at present waste is in temporary storage at 122 sites in 39 states

6397777 were gonna disagree on this one i respect your view on abortion but im pro choice and you know pastor rick jesus never mentions abortion in the bible he did say though that its easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter heaven now thats a metaphor but its also good tax policy unlike john mccain i want to make it easier for rich people to go to heaven
6397778 the withdrawal of long military columns will start in a few days we came here in a hurry to help civilians and russian citizens and it will take as long as it takes
6397779 they the georgians are perverting the agreement the agreement doesnt indicate a specific time for withdrawal
6397780 the deal means we are able to take responsibility for the safety of our military personnel
6397781 the pullback has started at such a pace that by the end of august 22 all the forces of the russian federation will be behind the line of our zone of responsibility
6397782 they dont show any sign that they want to give up control
6397783 it looks like the word withdrawal is understood in different ways by different people
6397784 some european states made an honest mistake not to make a clear and ambiguous signal to russia and georgia has paid the price
6397785 the timing of the conclusion of the missile defense deal is anything but accidental
6397786 now that the missile system is going forward the deal takes on much sharper overtones from the russian perspective
6397787 before the georgia invasion i was against the installation of the missile shield in poland
6397788 but now after the events there i feel threatened from the east and i dont regret the decision
6397789 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6397790 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6397860 with nato now set to enlarge from 19 members to take on seven east european nations including the three baltic states it is said that both the bush team and the committee for the liberation of iraq want the political mechanism of the atlantic alliance to replace the un security council in giving multilateral legitimacy to any major us action outside north america
6397861 this is because unlike the un security council where the french or russians might block american action natos political decisions do not require consensus the only natos military decisions require consensus

6397913 we came to the sales company because sales were at a standstill and profits were dipping the wisdom and perspective they brought to the sales and business side of our company were great i never thought about sales this way before the sales company continues to help us prioritize and decide which direction is best for our company they dont make decisions for us they help us make better decisions my business has been steadily growing and weve hired three new employees since we started working with the sales company they are the guardian angel of our business
6397914 our first meeting with the sales company i recall you telling our group that they would have to work with a new system after the meeting it seemed each person had some resistance to offer but were already so busy
6397915 today we employ a simple and effective sales management program thanks to your practical approach we have formalized our revenue forecasting process and increased individual sales accountability thus allowing us to proactively manage our sales efforts the new process shortly became routine thank you for your immeasurable help yes change is painful but mediocrity is more so

6397988 one of the most insightful analyses of the occupation ive read his voice cries out to be heard
6397989 a comprehensive matrix of control was implemented to perpetuate israeli control forever
6397990 invisible system behind a facade of proper administration thus protecting israels
6397991 profound structural imbalances in the palestinian economy and an artificial dependence upon israel
6397992 everything he did had a clear focus and purpose beating the palestinians into submission extending israels sovereignty to the jordan river and preventing the establishment of a viable palestinian state
6397993 a permanent solution an end of the occupation based on the notion of cantonization
6397994 to transform its matrix of control and permanent occupation into a stable peaceful state of affairs

6397999 the petitioners have not discharged their evidential burden of proof on the cause of financial loss making the petition invalid
6398000 my initial observation is that if what transpired is true as alleged by adwari it constitutes gross abuse of office by the council
6398001 business in our subcounties is being paralysed because of the districts failure to send this money
6398002 these local leaders know the problems the district has gone through
6398003 president yoweri museveni gives a lot of money to lira district but when it comes to election time they criticise him and say he has done nothing yet people in leadership positions have continued to embezzle the money
6398004 if you have any clue about corruption in nusaf or naads national agricultural advisory services inform us even if its about me just go and tell the police
6398005 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
6398006 our reporters are working in some very risky areas and are taking on some very edgy topics
6398007 last month kony telephoned us and asked for one last meeting before he can sign and i am in the process of preparing a meeting between lra leader joseph kony and the mediator riek machar of south sudan
6398008 a positive development which must be supported and encouraged by all
6398009 all we are waiting for is kony to sign the final peace agreement president museveni has been ready all this time so that the task remains to put the agreements to practice thats the challenge
6398010 the outcome may be the suspension of the warrants to enable the implementation of the agreement so that general kony can come back freely to uganda without fear of being arrested to go to the hague
6398011 kony says that he wants peace now he wants one more meeting only one more meeting so we are trying to organise that meeting we hope that in one or two weeks we are going to meet kony and we hope that this time he is going to sign
6398012 if this meeting will take place it means they have reconciled because you know that an lra unit had attacked an spla sudan peoples liberation army unit which resulted in deaths of spla soldiers and some sudanese civilians
6398013 well if he fails to turn up he will only keep himself longer in the bush
6398014 but on our side and that of the mediator we will keep the door open for him the government of uganda is ready to implement the agreement
6398015 i think this process is irreversible no one is interested in resuming war
6398016 we are only waiting for a date from kony for us members of the delegation to go and meet at ri kwangba and discuss who the new leader of the delegation will be and also agree on the way forward for the peace process
6398017 is it not just another opportunity to test our patience i have long lost interest in ever seeing kony sign the peace agreement if anything we are already getting used to the situation let him be where he is we are tired
6398018 several miles away from here and already without his fighters i dont care about what kony does now
6398019 let him live in the congo forests while we continue to rebuild our lives which he destroyed
6398020 yeah im happy because kony wants to go back and resume the peace process
6398021 i think he will sign and come back to stay with the people

6398026 a better process enables higher transistor counts larger caches and more cores ultimately the cores will impact performance more but the larger caches will help as well
6398027 going from four to six cores will see close to the 50 percent improvement linear scaling with a little slowdown due to i o contention

6398049 the plan is to bring all of us together that meet specific needs in darlington county into one room hear what each other have to say and hopefully come away with tangible ideas to improve communication and collaboration
6398050 the coordinating council is founded on the idea that communication and real collaboration can help solve some of our most chronic problems those problems that our clients patients and students face every day education health care employment housing and others
6398051 the byerly founda tion supports the dar lington county coordi nating councils efforts here because the services forum has the potential to strengthen the capacity of our community
6398052 the coordinating council is a boundary spanning organization that has the ability through sustainable activities like the services forum to make real change happen in our communities participating organizations can and should continue to participate in conversations that result in a cohesion of human services that sustains itself over time
6398053 having a good understanding of the many different kinds and levels of services provided in the county makes meeting the needs of our clients that much easier and more effective we want to keep the communication and collaboration going and the forum helps us shine a light on where we are and where we need to be going

6398203 i think its kind of going to be a hassle
6398204 they always always always do these with the most optimistic time schedules and they just really dont have a whole lot of room for delay
6398205 we wont allow any occupancy of the building unless were convinced its completely safe as safe as a finished building

6398207 its the new hot spot and the kids want to be in there
6398208 all i can tell you at this point is they want to keep trying
6398209 we will continue to work around the clock to finish construction and get the units ready
6398210 it is our intention to have everyone moved in by mid september we apologize for the inconvenience and will continue updating you regularly
6398211 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6398212 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6398213 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6398214 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6398215 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing five to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6398216 i totally agree with dr ouellet that we need to do better but most of my patients cant afford to go to dr ouellets clinics
6398217 were going to have to find solutions that benefit everyone and not just people who can afford to pay
6398218 theres just no market outside of major cities for this kind of thing
6398219 they knew what brian day was doing they knew what im doing and they voted for us
6398220 weve always been highly in favour of a publicly funded system but i think we as an organization certainly have reached the stage where we realize there have to be alternatives because the system is not working
6398221 the wait times are totally unacceptable and there are shortages across the country especially in newfoundland the cracks are starting to show
6398222 the cma remains concerned that federal politicians are not addressing some of the key issues affecting health and health care
6398223 we have been trained and are dedicated to providing excellent care to our patients
6398224 they have to do it a little more craftily than in the past but it wouldnt be too hard for them the conservatives to set a trap for the liberals
6398225 prime minister stephen harper can engineer the defeat of his government in 30 seconds
6398226 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
6398227 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc qu b cois and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately mr dion has indicated that the government has to be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
6398228 a lot of patience and because i struck at the right time
6398229 a bit of reform party hocus pocus so now harper is caught in that but not really caught
6398230 its what in the trade they call a pious hope in other words a promise that can be broken with impunity if you think you can get away with it
6398231 he wants to get the opposition especially the liberals to put up or shut up
6398232 and so this is a lot of posturing and chest beating on behalf of both harper and dion
6398233 i dont think the liberals can continue to play the same game
6398234 now that stage is over and mr dion is the one who has to make a tough decision
6398235 we want an election as soon as we move ahead in the polls
6398236 i cant wait to see the look in your evil eyes
6398237 the opposition cannot continue to criticize the government on every single bill
6398238 right wing politics have a proven record especially in ontario of destroying an economy

6398302 charter schools are terrific options for the parents and children of new york
6398303 competition and innovation among schools continues to breed success in our city schools
6398304 the parents and children of staten island still do not have the educational choice available in the other four boroughs
6398305 this is unacceptable and liberals like steve harrison must get out of the way of parents desire to have their children receive the best possible education
6398306 as a general rule im opposed to charter schools they set up a two tiered privatization system that weakens the public school system
6398307 bob has a 24 year record in the new york state assembly of fighting to reduce taxes on families and reduce regulations on businesses and he will continue that service as the next congressman for the 13th congressional district
6398308 the heat which is contained below the surface of the earth contains 50 000 times the energy that could be produced from the world supply of oil and gas
6398309 geothermal is clean 100 percent free of pollution and it is much more dependable than more well known alternative energy sources like wind and solar
6398310 as your congressman i intend to bring forth new legislation and tax incentives to develop these areas and areas like them across the country
6398311 apple has a priority list of features and we got as far as we could down that list
6398312 this lease is only for their personal gain it has done nothing for the public
6398313 they want the lease extended and they are denying the public access

6398315 the volunteers do a great job our successes are parallel we want everyone to get along and were just requesting the extension as part of our business plan most contracts like this are for 30 years
6398316 lets face it my business is booking dates and in this economy we need all that we can get
6398317 i dont want to restrict access i think more people will come to the holiday event if it is closer to or after christmas when everyone has finished all the things they have to do
6398318 so many volunteers are involved in putting the holiday tour together and they all have families and their own holiday things to do they cant donate that much time closer to christmas
6398319 the state had the vision to purchase the building they shouldnt lose sight of their vision and responsibility to preserve it for future generations
6398320 this lease is only for their personal gain it has done nothing for the public
6398321 they want the lease extended and they are denying the public access

6398330 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal
6398331 a 35 cent listing fee virtually eliminates the upfront cost for sellers to put more of their great inventory on ebay and creates more opportunity than ever for sellers to build successful businesses
6398332 today items paid with cheque or money order are 80 per cent more likely to result in an item not received than those paid with credit card or paypal
6398333 also buyers who pay with check or money order are 50 peer cent more likely to leave negative feedback than those who pay with electronic methods so starting in late october 2008 we are moving to 100 per cent electronic payments credit cards propay or paypal
6398334 the web has moved on and ebay is stuck in still waters
6398335 the main challenge ebay faces is that it is becoming easier and easier to find things to buy on the web simply by searching for what you want on google during the early days of the web people needed a few big ecommerce sites they could trust and that could organize everything that was for sale online that need was filled by amazon and ebay
6398336 partly that is because ebay has done such a good job creating a semi professional class of online sellers that it is harder and harder to actually find bargains there
6398337 now ebay is going to try to take the competition to amazon
6398338 i think its a big mistake they claim their reason for changing the focus to fixed price sales is that that sector of their site has grown more than the auction sales growth in the last quarter auction sales growth has slowed but is still growing its all about how much money they can make
6398339 amazon doesnt favour its buyers over its sellers by a margin of 2000 1 the way ebay does
6398340 amazon sellers are not going to start selling on ebay its too expensive and ebay favours the buyers over sellers and so ebay can forget about luring amazon sellers away from amazon
6398341 i have not had one non paying bidder nor have i had any checks bounce
6398342 ebay is lying when they say they are doing this for the good of the buyers they are doing it to increase their bottom line pure and simple

6398353 if the iron reacts with water then it will be locked away with other minerals and wont reach the core as metallic iron
6398354 if we look at the star we will know the iron silicate ratio and some of the chemistry that was present while these planets were forming
6398355 if we got nailed by cosmic rays it would cause us a lot of genetic mutations
6398356 the closer we get to steins the more accurate our knowledge of the asteroids position relative to rosetta will be
6398357 thanks to rosettas cameras we will obtain increasingly precise measurements that will allow us to adjust again if necessary rosettas orbit for an optimal asteroid encounter
6398358 both of rosettas navigation cameras could already see the asteroid from the very beginning of the tracking campaign despite the long distance from steins and contrary to what we expected
6398359 the exceptional quality of the osiris scientific camera namely its angular resolution provided data as accurate as expected and made our current trajectory calculations very precise
6398360 it is the first time ever that we have used optical instrumentation on board a scientific spacecraft for navigation as opposed to the usual techniques based on analysing radio signals
6398361 the exceptional results are really encouraging and we look forward to using this technique again in the future if and when it is possible

6398364 i think hes seeing the ball really well right now
6398365 its very different away from home but it should have the advantage of making it a big open game
6398366 we played that way for 90 per cent of the games last season away from home
6398367 we played 4 3 3 at crystal palace and beat them that was my plan to play the same way when we lost to them here
6398368 we did the same at burnley and won that game playing 4 3 3 and playing really well that day
6398369 but in the main we play 4 4 2 and had a decent away record last season
6398370 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6398371 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
6398372 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
6398373 they need relief now so my attitude is lets build up the system we got lets make it more efficient we may be over time as we make the system more efficient and everybodys covered decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively

6398376 we are extremely excited to bring a player of this caliber to port huron
6398377 in my opinion he will be the best player in the league he will serve as a leader on and off the ice and will be our team captain
6398378 the other teams in the league have made their teams better and we knew we needed to do the same thing weve got three first lines right now and we are really excited about that
6398379 i am at a point in my life where all i want to do is win a championship
6398380 after talking to stan i knew right then and there that this team will win this year it is not going to be easy but i am very happy to be here and i will give 110 every day

6398409 she could have pushed for days and that baby wouldnt have come out she never budged when we used the forceps
6398410 your pelvis is just too small you could try another vaginal birth if the baby was small or preterm
6398411 you carried this baby at least a full 43 weeks
6398412 i just want to emphasis that you were extremely lucky a few more minutes and she would have died you both would have you came very close were going to have to keep you back here for a while your blood pressure is extremely high

6398453 since the riots in march reliable witnesses have established that 400 people have been killed in the tibet the number of victims is obviously higher

6398462 situations like this are hard to take when you know how dedicated mikes life has been to playing basketball
6398463 over the last three years mike has contributed significantly to our success both on and off the floor and has been an important member of our basketball family
6398464 when i asked mike why he wanted to come to pitt he simply said he wanted to win and he has won going 40 8 as a starter he has grown into a leader and has become an outstanding example for the younger players in our program mike has earned his degree and will have the opportunity to continue his career professionally when he returns to the floor
6398465 we were hopeful that mike would be granted a sixth year of eligibility and it is unfortunate that the request has been denied
6398466 our hearts went out to mike when he suffered the injury against duke and we feel for him now mike is an impressive young man with a bright future and we wish him nothing but the best he will always be an important part of the panther family

6398708 we took aggressive markdowns in the second quarter to drive customer traffic and achieve our goal of keeping inventory levels in line with the sales trend
6398709 these lowered inventory levels which we expect to continue should give us a cleaner platform to present fresh fashion going forward
6398710 we remain focused on what we can control in this uncertain environment and we believe our investments related to expense reductions should begin to benefit us in the fall season and into 2009
6398711 we did i think a good job with the wii last year but were doing a great job this year because this is where the casual audience is the mass audience is here its a great control system but youve got to learn to use it
6398712 outside of the controls moving their development mindset to the wii allowed them to focus on making the game look as good as possible im really proud of how it looks it does not look like a wii game to me
6398713 theres no excuse to not having the wii version looking great
6398714 the danger for hermits is individualism and anarchy the danger for cenobites is excessive organization totalitarianism and mechanical routine in either case the only remedy is fidelity to grace close union with the holy spirit who breathes the divine life into souls and informs rules and regulations with the spiraculum vitae without which they are only empty forms a monastery must be an organism not just an organization

6398725 we are focused on improving the profitability of the company and while we are pleased to achieve the first profitable quarter in endevcos history we understand we have a lot more work to do
6398726 the revenue increase as well as the profit recognition is due primarily to the success that we have experienced with the first horizontal well at short junction field commented chris a dittmar endevcos chief executive officer we expect to continue to improve our financial position as we accelerate our development operations in the field and begin to develop the other properties in our inventory
6398727 fsn south and krystal are lifestyle brands and products that are widely recognized throughout the south
6398728 the opportunity to partner with krystal in this truly southern event featuring internationally recognized competitors is a natural fit for our respective brands and reinforces our commitment of localism for the community we serve
6398729 we couldnt be more thrilled to have krystal square off v televised this year for the first time on fsn south
6398730 fsn south is the leading sports network in the south and together were committed to providing eating fans the best coverage possible from weekly updates during the qualifying circuit to a full one hour live program on the day of the finals featuring the must see rematch between chestnut and kobayashi
6398731 weve seen deal activity in india hold steady for three consecutive quarters but this most recent quarter posted the second highest investment total on record due in large part to the 70 million second round for laqshya media of mumbai the second largest deal ever completed in india
6398732 this highlights two growing trends within the region one being a growing interest in advertising plays that capitalize on indias emerging infrastructure and growing internet usage the other being an increase in second round deals which is expected as vcs are helping their portfolio companies expand and steering them toward liquidity
6398733 while the size of venture deals in the u s europe and even china continues to climb venture capitalists have shown some restraint in terms of investments in india due largely to the risk still associated with this emerging region in fact since we began tracking venture investment in india the median deal size has dropped from 17 million in 2005 to 10 million in 2006 and now to 8 million in the first six months of 2008
6398734 while mix and pricing actions allowed our specialty food operating margin to improve over the prior quarter level food operations remained greatly challenged by markedly higher commodity costs our review of strategic alternatives for nonfood operations continued as we divested our last automotive operation our only remaining significant nonfood business is candles and we do not expect further progress on our strategic evaluation of these operations under current market conditions however we will continue to review our options and may revisit our efforts as conditions improve
6398735 with the sale of our aluminum truck accessory operations in june our two year strategic review resulted in the divestiture or closure of several nonfood operations that had combined net sales in excess of 300 million as recently as fiscal 2006 we feel we have now clearly defined our future focus on the food sector despite having improved our future opportunities through several new retail product introductions implementing operational improvements and expanding our foodservice customer offerings we faced food commodity and paraffin wax costs reaching unprecedented highs during fiscal 2008 the comparative impact of these costs is estimated at roughly 70 million about half of which we recovered through increased product pricing
6398736 we recognize that aggressive action is necessary to mitigate much higher year over year ingredient costs as we enter fiscal 2009 our food group is in the process of pushing forward on a number of cost saving initiatives relating to ingredient usage we recently closed our atlanta dressing facility to take advantage of lower cost capacity available at our other locations additional pricing actions are currently being implemented and we continue our intensive product development efforts we are also implementing higher candle pricing as we confront significantly higher wax costs and the adverse effect of lower operating levels we look forward to addressing our challenges in the framework of a business structure that is focused on taking advantage of our strong market positions and highly recognizable brands
6398737 as long as men can go topless women should have a same and equal right
6398738 otherwise men should also be forced to wear something that hides their chests
6398739 women should go topless and rally publicly in great numbers on aug 23 to protest that despicable treatment and exercise their rights
6398740 we encourage all womens groups and individuals to join us at these rallies together with peaceful femininity but unshakable determination well protest this gross inequality in the law well demand that our right to go topless be recognized in accordance with the 14th amendment of the u s constitution and that all state laws be amended to reflect that right

6398760 the new recommendation from the smc is to be welcomed new data supporting the role of versatis in post herpetic neuralgia will further establish that such a novel non systemic treatment approach offers significant benefits in the older patient group who suffer co morbidities and consequential polypharmacy
6398761 the smc is to be congratulated on its revised decision for versatis theyve taken a huge step forward in extending options for pain relief for people living with neuropathic pain this decision will alleviate a lot of suffering

6398765 hes never relaxed hes a competitor he doesnt know how to relax he wants to win
6398766 were in practice with the select team and we dont even have the scoreboard on and he wants to keep score thats just the thing hes so competitive in everything he does so is he content no hes hungry because this is something that he wants to put on his resume that he doesnt have
6398767 last year he made a point of wanting to show that he was going to be a part of something that he was committed to and i think hes living it out and playing it out this summer and i think hes done a great job representing the united states and representing his team
6398768 second quarter results benefited from tight inventory management better sell throughs of regular priced merchandise and the impact on overall sales from stimulus checks
6398769 we expect the remainder of the year to be difficult as our customer continues to face difficult economic conditions we remain comfortable with our original guidance for the second half of the year with earnings per diluted share in a range of 06 to 04 versus 03 last year

6398796 those who came along were very impressed with the centre which is a big improvement on existing facilities having health and council services under one roof will make it more convenient for those accessing services

6398798 we are very excited to let gamers get their hands on fallout 3 the latest chapter in this beloved and highly acclaimed franchise
6398799 to meet the huge demand for this title by our fans worldwide we are planning one of the biggest launches of any game released this year
6398800 i want it i have to have it if i cant pay for it ill just find a way to get it without paying for it
6398801 he said i probably was already punished enough by larry bird and them calling indiana and not being able to go the the league and it affecting me lawson said
6398802 so i dont think too many things will happen probably one sprint or a couple of sprints but not too much he said
6398803 yeah i think so because coach talked to larry bird and they were real high on me but they called and said they had a lot of problems with things like that there were a couple people they named but they called and said they just cant take a chance it probably affected it my decision a little bit
6398804 you go through things maybe it happened for a reason you cant go back and think about it now you cant change things so im just looking forward
6398805 i am very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6398806 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6398807 we are launching a range of products to protect prices and offer our customers peace of mind in an uncertain market and are also announcing that we will more than double the number of vulnerable customers we help
6398808 we have new coaches and new guys all over ive been working hard to get better so in a lot of ways i feel like a new player
6398809 your marketing plan should not rely on only one method of l
6398810 i want to be the guy out here i wanted to have as good a day as i could and just show the coaches that i can still put em through
6398811 i would have loved to have come out here and have a good day because me and ryan have been even all camp
6398812 i would have loved to have had a day like i did two years ago and not miss
6398813 i never think the job is mine its a dogfight the whole time
6398814 aaron is an unbelievable kicker and so is ben buchanan he is going to be great one day
6398815 when nuge was an all american he said he took every day as if it was his job to lose ive done the same thing
6398816 there is a lot of competition here but as a kicker you want that on you
6398817 its not a position for everyone just like running back isnt and quarterback isnt
6398818 thats something ive always grown up with being a baseball player and playing other sports theres pressure on all positions and when the game is on the line you want it on your shoulders
6398819 ive been his roommate through camp and ive gotten to know ryan
6398820 hes not only a great kicker hes a great individual
6398821 it is meant to replace the home phone which has been left behind by technology

6398824 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts
6398825 the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6398826 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media
6398827 above all though i am so sad that this together with the other allegations made have been raised to distract and unsettle me the coaching team and more importantly my boxers ahead of the most important bouts of their lives
6398828 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6398829 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6398830 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6398831 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6398832 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6398833 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6398834 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6398835 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6398836 we have taken the hard decision to put it down unfortunately
6398837 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6398838 you said youd give us a 24 hour stay of execution
6398839 this is certainly not what we would have hoped we would have hoped that the animal would have been ok
6398840 we didnt make enough plays and then gave too much on first down and gave up short conversions on third down missed tackles big plays that will about do it
6398841 the shooting match between inflation in prices and deflation in assets is still a long way from won
6398842 the markets are telling us to prepare for hard times and a global spate of the worst deflation to be seen in generations
6398843 the cause of weaker broad money growth is not difficult to find
6398844 lombard street research calculates the three month growth rate in money supply is just 2 1 well below the six month rate of 6 3 and the 12 month rate of 11 5
6398845 if our firm is in trouble we would rather fund ourselves than fund hedge funds
6398846 convey any additional information about economic activity that is not already embodied in m2 another but narrower measure of money and has not played a role in monetary policy process for many years
6398847 have we reached the moment when gold bugs must start questioning their deepest assumptions
6398848 have they bought too deeply into the dollar collapse m3 monetary bubble tale ignoring all the other moving parts in the complex global system nobody wants to be left holding the bag all the way down to the bottom of the slide long after the hedge funds have sold out
6398849 thats well above the average 32 billion in aussie dollars raised in the same period in 2005 to 2007
6398850 these reports show the most comprehensive picture of nhs dentistry to date under the new contractual arrangements
6398851 as a qualified dentist myself it is interesting to see how a typical course of dental treatment is changing
6398852 our challenge is encouraging people to visit their dentist for regular check ups even if they feel they dont need to
6398853 there is also a perception amongst the public that there is a growing lack of nhs dentists and these latest statistics prove that there is actually more and more nhs dentistry services opening around the country
6398854 those that are able to access care are confronted with a system that discourages modern preventive care by placing targets rather than patients at its heart
6398855 the apparent change in treatment patterns is also of concern and requires further investigation so that the impact of the new contract is fully understood
6398856 ministers need to stop dithering admit that their new dental contract has been a complete failure and take action to make good their pledge to give everyone access to an nhs dentist
6398857 palliative care should be an integral part of the support given to patients and their families and carers during the last months days and hours of their lives
6398858 in many areas of scotland the voluntary sector and the health service provide excellent and much appreciated care but access to good quality palliative care varies across the country
6398859 there are many examples across the country of nhs boards and the voluntary sector working together to improve services
6398860 this is a process that is already under way but theres no doubt we have to accelerate that progress
6398861 research has shown that good relationships and good sex education can raise the age that young people first try out sexual activity
6398862 most young people want to hear the facts from their parents or carers and be able to talk with them about body changes feelings and boyfriends or girlfriends
6398863 yet many parents and carers feel embarrassed or are not sure what to say
6398864 the speakeasy course was specially developed for those parents and carers to help them improve their communication skills with children and young people and to give them more confidence
6398865 while the core to improving lunchtime choices for scotlands teenagers is about supporting them with the information about good food and healthy eating the scottish government and local councils have to play their part as well
6398866 these young people are consumers who are making their own decisions
6398867 they will only stay in school if whats on offer there in terms of both the food and the lunchtime environment is better than whats on offer outside
6398868 the out to lunch report suggests the obesity time bomb has still not been defused for many young scots but it is not something that schools or parents can do on their own
6398869 beyond the school gate we acknowledge the challenge posed by chip vans
6398870 however some local authorities east renfrewshire and west dunbartonshire and more recently renfrewshire and falkirk council have taken steps to prevent them trading near schools at lunchtime
6398871 others have introduced their own vans with healthy options we would encourage others to make best use of the current rules and regulations and look at best practice across the country to address this issue
6398872 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia
6398873 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6398874 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6398875 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it
6398876 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy
6398877 there is no logic i can see for queensland to not develop uranium reserves
6398878 the goal was to give the viewer a great show and second to show that a toyota isnt a boring and anonymous car
6398879 at this early stage we believe he had fallen from a block of flats
6398880 one line of inquiry officers are investigating is that the boy may have been chased prior to the fall
6398881 we believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification and confirmation that all next of kin have been informed

6398914 the south is constructing new marinas with large capacities this is what our country needs because the hotels are going through a difficult phase due to the lack of tourists thus the government should place more importance in the construction of marinas rather than increasing bed capacity

6398960 i spoke to adrian last wednesday and his campaigning spirit and his optimism remained undimmed
6398961 my thoughts are with his family at this time and i know they will be proud that adrians achievements will continue to help others after he has gone
6398962 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different
6398963 adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6398964 kay and i hope that all adrians good work will be continued by all those who knew him and loved him

6398968 is this a common phenomenon in a city i mean like does it happen to other cities or its a particular one in newcastle
6398969 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6398970 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6398971 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic

6399019 the agency is absolutely committed to maintaining the safety of life at sea detailed contingency plans will be in place and although our services will be more limited than usual but the public should know that distress calls will be answered as normal
6399020 the message is still the same if you see something that you believe is dangerous or putting peoples lives at risk dont delay use the distress vhf channel 16 or if near a shoreline dial 999 and ask for the coastguard making sure you know your own position
6399021 sea users should also be aware that this industrial action is by those responsible for co ordinating rescues the rescuers themselves will continue to operate as normal

6399122 yang unik di mini album ini kita kasih gratis album ini bisa diperoleh dengan membeli tiket film the saman atau bisa langsung aja dateng ke kantor triplepop record ini merupakan salah satu bentuk aksi untuk menentang pembajakan kalau sebelumnya pecinta musik membeli murah dengan kualitas rendahan di lapak lapak bajakan kali ini saya berupaya untuk memberikan gratis dengan kualitas yang baik

6399163 ar trebuii sa fim platiti integral nu doar 75 in fiecare luna consultantul emite un aviz preliminar si conform contractului ar trebuii sa fim platiti integral
6399164 daca cititi cateva din frazele raportului consultantului care supravegheaza modul in care se realizeaza autostrada transilvania aprecierea ca va costa peste sapte miliarde de euro pare plauzibila cred ca vom cheltui cu cel putin cinci miliarde de euro mai mult pentru aceasta autostrada

6399173 genital herpes is a significant and growing public health issue all previous attempts to develop either a prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine have either failed or have shown efficacy in only a very limited proportion of the population we believe that this vaccine based on a new understanding of hsv biology has the potential to substantially advance the field accordingly todays news is a significant milestone towards realizing this potential
6399174 this may well be a milestone in the treatment of hypophosphatasia
6399175 studies in a mouse model for hypophosphatasia show enb 0040 has the potential to greatly enhance the quality of life for patients
6399176 in preclinical studies using a mouse model enb 0040 consistently improved survival as well as bone and dental manifestations of hypophosphatasia the initiation of clinical studies brings us closer to the goal of providing drug therapy for hypophosphatasia patients where none currently exists
6399177 det har ikke v ret et stort problem at en motor har svigtet eller er blevet slukket lige under starten man kan sagtens korrigere med sideroret for den sk ve p virkning det giver at starte med n motor og der er kr fter nok i den tilbagev rende motor til at komme sikkert i luften

6399180 this study demonstrates the potential for personalized medicine combining selection of patients with a specific type of genetic mutation and a drug treatment that has been specifically designed to overcome that mutation
6399181 the publication of these ground breaking results in the lancet offers new hope to those patients with cf due to a nonsense mutation in the cftr gene and establishes a path forward for evaluating the efficacy and long term safety of ptc124
6399182 we are very pleased by this positive outcome from our ongoing collaboration with ptc
6399183 the development of ptc124 fits well with our strategic goal of supporting approaches that have the potential to modify the course of cf we are continuing to work together with ptc and the broader cf medical community to support the next steps in the evaluation of ptc124 for the clinical benefit for the treatment of nonsense mutation cf
6399184 the publication of these data provides clinical proof of concept in cf for the ptc124 mechanism of action in overcoming nonsense mutations as the basis for treating genetic disease
6399185 based on these results we intend to initiate a phase 2b study later this year to evaluate the clinical benefit of ptc124 in adults and children with nonsense mutation mediated cf given the potential applicability of ptc124 to multiple genetic disorders we have a pivotal study of ptc124 for nonsense mutation duchenne becker muscular dystrophy ongoing and are planning proof of concept studies in additional genetic disorders

6399189 first his troops are going to be out on monday then his troops were going to be out on wednesday now his troops are going to be out on friday
6399190 im beginning to wonder if the russian president is ever going to keep his word or can he keep his word or whats going on there
6399191 a multi annual contract between rt and pat kenny is in the final stages of negotiation it is expected that negotiations will be finalised before september 1st neither party will be making any further comment on the issue until the process is complete
6399192 i cant go into detail about how far we are down the line but there is no disagreement
6399193 die privaten konsumausgaben sind und bleiben wahrscheinlich zun chst das sorgenkind der konjunkturentwicklung
6399194 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6399195 we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
6399196 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6399197 gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6399198 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learnt why the israeli generals failed
6399199 selbst wenn ein triebwerk in brand ger t ist noch schub da
6399200 i got a terrible start initially but was third into turn one then i saw the safety car flag so i rolled it and then the rain started on the re start i got to the front and i knew once i had clear road i could get away so im thrilled to get the win
6399201 it was a bit dodgy out there especially when it started spitting with rain it was good to have bruce in front of me as it helped to set the pace on the re start i got swamped and i had to be careful of the damp as well i worked hard and got second place chris did well im pleased for him
6399202 im disappointed that the red flag came out but on the re start i got away good hawkes came past me and it was obvious that he had better pace than i did so i didnt try to pass him again then birch got me and it was the same situation it was my own fault as i assumed that the track was wetter than it was and i had softened off the suspension for the wet we shall see what two weeks brings
6399203 i was in sixth place and chasing fifth i could see the guys in front slowing up but i still had plenty of grip at that point and there were no spots on my visor it wasnt until i tipped into the last turn that i realised how wet it was and down i went my bike isnt in great shape but ill do my best to be on track at oulton park
6399204 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6399205 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6399206 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent
6399207 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend obamas got plans big plans for your money
6399208 ready to tax ready to spend not ready to lead
6399209 we have a once in a generation chance to bring meaningful and lasting change to our country by electing barack obama president and sending a stronger democratic majority to the senate
6399210 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6399211 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6399212 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6399213 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6399214 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6399215 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6399216 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6399217 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6399218 honestly its the best thing i could have my done for my career
6399219 the number of superdelegates has gotten too large in relation to overall delegates
6399220 we want to give more control back to the voters everyone thinks there ought to be more weight given to the results of the elections
6399221 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
6399222 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
6399223 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
6399224 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6399225 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6399226 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6399227 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6399228 almost every assault of any kind is related to drinking the drinking age issue is not just about drinking and driving its a much bigger pie and we college presidents see that whole pie
6399229 legislators have made laws that the people do not take seriously students point to our alcohol programs and say see everybody understands that we are going to drink and theyre right
6399230 youre worried about the future here people have gone through very tough times
6399231 when youve got entire industries that have shipped overseas when youve got thousands of jobs being lost thats tough
6399232 its going to be tough territory for barack obama to win
6399233 but the goal is to get as many votes as you possibly can every vote is one vote closer to carrying virginia
6399234 it doesnt take a lot of courage to go to martinsville and talk about trade what would be courageous is to come to
6399235 if you are wondering about a much talked about exploit just ignore it and know that a patch is on the way
6399236 there is still work to do but were making really good progress
6399237 if i were you i would disregard reports and rumors anonymous statements about where this is
6399238 what my presence can do is to identify any final obstacles
6399239 its a chance for me to sit with the prime minister and really get a sense of if there is anything else we need to do from washington to get to closure
6399240 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible
6399241 nobody wants to get to the withdrawal point prematurely where the iraqis cant handle it but were close on all these issues
6399242 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6399243 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6399244 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6399245 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6399246 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6399247 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6399248 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6399249 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6399250 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6399251 i was stunned by the news today of the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones
6399252 there is a great gap where she stood on behalf of affordable health care womens issues access to quality education and fairness in voting
6399253 whether you were a presidential candidate a colleague debating on the floor or a friend passing time you wanted her on your team for her quick legal mind tenacious debating skills her infectious humor and that thousand watt smile
6399254 my heart is heavy she was larger than life and we will all greatly miss the gentlewoman from cleveland my prayers are with her family friends and staff
6399255 she believed in all the best things about our nation
6399256 and was a tireless force for justice equality and opportunity
6399257 a passionate representative who worked tirelessly to make cleveland a better place for her constituents
6399258 we were friends who through the years shared many laughs even as we engaged in legislative battles from opposite sides of the political aisle
6399259 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6399260 congress spends money like a drunken sailor only i never knew a sailor drunk or sober with the imagination of congress
6399261 as a former drunken sailor i resent being compared to members of congress
6399262 well china is going to be a bigger and more powerful country than the united states of america
6399263 we hold these truths to be self evident that all of us are created equal and endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights among these are life
6399264 the willingness with which young americans will serve their country in future wars is directly related to the treatment of those who have previously served and sacrificed in conflict
6399265 well were still waiting for new mexico to come in to see who the next president of the united states is
6399266 i really do not know what to make of this
6399267 cuba is a sports loving country and interest extends beyond the islands participation to that of athletes from other latitudes
6399268 there could be nothing more diametrically opposed than olympics sports coverage in cuba and the united states
6399269 its a very frustrating job hosting this event and at the same time dealing with caribbean governments all of which appear to operate in a similar inefficient fashion
6399270 you take the red pill you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes
6399271 the nose of the plane and the front wheels had lifted
6399272 whether the rear wheels got off the ground is still being investigated
6399273 it was like a scene from hell bodies were everywhere
6399274 it would be foolhardy at this point to rule out the checklight problem as a contributing factor
6399275 regulations governing all craft ensure that even after losing power in one engine the plane still has enough power to take off
6399276 given the rear position of the engines on the md 82
6399277 if there was an explosion there it may have meant the loss of control of the rudder and tail
6399278 congress and the bush administration have struggled this year to find the right type and amount of federal subsidy that will ensure that students have access to fairly priced
6399279 an analysis by the nonpartisan congressional research service suggests they may be attempting a nearly impossible task the report by the research service a federal agency that does policy analysis for lawmakers from both parties asserts that the governments system of distributing money through
6399280 the immediate gratification of using plastic to buy an imac tickets to a coldplay concert and nights of bar hopping has a way of coming back to haunt college students after graduation
6399281 despite their lack of a credit history and sizable student loans most college students can get their hands on credit cards with as much ease as a swipe and theyre often lured into doing so with awards like free t shirts along with the freebies however come some not so pleasant surprises high interest rates and a range of fees and penalties to graduate with honors in credit card management heres what students need to know
6399282 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6399283 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6399284 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6399285 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6399286 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6399287 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6399288 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6399289 that technology we feel is going to be around for a while now
6399290 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
6399291 when you have a 71 year old presidential candidate its particularly important that voters be confident that hes backed up by an experienced and qualified vice president prepared to step in and
6399292 first if your instinct is to run on experience it doesnt hurt to have a vice president whos got it too
6399293 but more than that according to this source picking lieberman would dramatically support mccains theme that he puts country first above all else
6399294 go with joe john go with joe and sin against maverickdom no more
6399295 lantas tiba tiba berubah lagi jadi pukul 18 30 itu pun belum tahu pesawat mana yang akan digunakan pokoknya ndak jelas lah
6399296 kasihan kan mereka sudah jauh jauh datang dan kumpul di nagoya sementara saya masih berada di jakarta
6399297 saya sudah bilang kepada panitia di sana pelatihan tetap dilakukan menunggu saya tiba
6399298 hitung saja kalau berangkat jam 18 30 mendarat di batam jam 20 an belum urus bagasi 15 20 menit lanjutkan perjalanan ke nagoya sekitar 30 menit berarti tiba di nagoya sekitar jam setengah sepuluh kasihan para petani jauh jauh datang
6399299 tetapi pesawat tersebut telah ditangani oleh mitra kami dari singapore airlines engineering company
6399300 mandala tidak akan menerbangkan pesawat yang tidak aman untuk itu mandala lebih baik memilih men delay pesawat demi keselamatan penerbangan
6399301 velar con todos sus medios y garantizar todas las actuaciones
6399302 lo que quieren ahora y en lo que debemos esforzarnos y lo que creo que se est haciendo y creo que se est haciendo bien es identificar a muchas de las personas que han fallecido cuidar a las personas que est n heridas e intentar que con la mayor celeridad posible puedan
6399303 defendi el presidente de los populares que acudi a la concentraci n tras visitar a algunos de los 19 heridos que permanecen ingresados en hospitales de la capital

6399311 awalnya saya hanya mencari dari desa desa di kecamatan terdekat seperti kecamatan salam namun saat ini permintaan di wilayah tersebut sudah mulai membeludak maka saya pun akhirnya harus berkeliling mencari di kecamatan kecamatan lain

6399314 ist bei n herer berlegung wirklich nicht ganz stimmig das produkt
6399315 schade wie auf dem dritten bild zu sehen ist erscheinen die noten leider nur
6399316 woher will das teil denn wissen was schon alles wieder verbraucht wurde
6399317 oder f r menschen die nunmal nicht stehen k nnen
6399318 at the start of the year we noticed demand was increasing
6399319 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing top hat and tails so his debt attracts more attention
6399320 if youre a debtor ill make sure that everyone who knows you knows that you owe money
6399321 your neighbours your clients your suppliers youre not going to like that

6399347 reverence towards god demands submission not only to gods will but also to gods providence
6399348 we are by nature what our lord was by choice namely children of a fallen race in a fallen world and subject to the consequences of the fall
6399349 in other words it is the law of things as they actually are that we must continually suffer from others it is the condition of our being that we shall be the victims of others abuse of their free wills it belongs to our position that our desires and inclinations should be continually thwarted and that we should be at the mercy of circumstances
6399350 it is our very sinfulness that impels us to demand an exemption from the created consequence of sin because in proportion as our sinfulness is great is our humility little
6399351 our efforts after sanctity do not withdraw us from the operation of this law quite the contrary

6399373 der mechaniker hat beim ber hren des seitenkastens und des lenkrades einen stromschlag erhalten es hat eine hochfrequente wechselspannung zwischen diesen ber hrpunkten bestanden die ursache lag im kers steuerger t in dem es sporadisch ein bersprechen unerw nschte bertragungen von elektrischer spannung zwischen zwei bertragungsmedien aufgrund induktiver oder kapazitiver kopplung anm d red vom hochvolt in das 12 volt netz gegeben hat ber die leitungen des 12 volt netzes ist die spannung zum lenkrad und ber das karbonchassis zur ck zum steuerger t gelangt
6399374 bestand f r den mechaniker und den fahrer eine ernsthafte gef hrdung
6399375 nein da die bertragbare energie bei diesem bersprecheffekt gering ist die energie reicht jedoch aus um eine sehr schmerzhafte reaktion hervorzurufen der fahrer war durch seinen rennanzug und die handschuhe gegen das fahrzeug isoliert und somit nicht gef hrdet
6399376 der bersprecheffekt war zun chst am fahrzeug nicht reproduzierbar da es sich um einen sporadisch aufgetretenen fehler des steuerger tes handelt aufgrund der sehr hohen frequenz der sich ergebenden spannung am lenkrad erkannten die sicherheitsmechanismen und datenaufzeichnungen den fehler nicht mangels daten mussten somit alle theoretischen m glichkeiten systematisch untersucht und durch versuche analysiert werden
6399377 ferner u ert sich der effekt nur unter bestimmten rahmenbedingungen die ohne erneutes fahren des kers versuchsfahrzeuges von jerez reproduziert werden mussten au erdem musste ein modell entwickelt werden welches zwischen lenkrad und seitenkasten installiert wurde um die eigenschaften des menschlichen k rpers als elektrisches bertragungselement nachzubilden
6399378 welche ma nahmen werden jetzt ergriffen um das problem zu beheben
6399379 die sehr umfassende analyse die wir gemacht haben hat neben den konkreten ma nahmen auch weitere empfehlungen ergeben die f r die konzeption elektrischer ker systeme sehr wertvoll sind zu den konkreten ma nahmen geh ren konstruktive nderungen im steuerger t zur vermeidung von bersprecheffekten erweiterte berwachungsfunktionen im bereich hoher frequenzen und eine leitende verbindung der chassisbauteile zur vermeidung jeglicher spannungspotenziale
6399380 wir haben die sicherheitsanalyse inklusive ma nahmen und empfehlungen bereits der fia zur verf gung gestellt und werden die erkenntnisse beim n chsten meeting der technischen arbeitsgruppe auch den anderen teams zug nglich machen
6399381 wann findet der n chste kers test auf einer rennstrecke statt
6399382 sobald alle erforderlichen erg nzungen des sicherheitskonzeptes umgesetzt sind wird das testprogramm fortgesetzt dies wird voraussichtlich im herbst der fall sein

6399448 e un momento triste e di grande riconoscimento per quanto fatto da franco sensi per la citta per la squadra e per il calcio italiano sono momenti tristi ma ce senso di grande affetto e rispetto
6399449 ce stata una bella partecipazione dei tifosi questo presidente la meritava al 100 franco sensi per la roma ha fatto di tutto ha detto il presidente della juventus giovanni cobolli gigli ha dato lanima io sono legato a sua figlia rosella da amicizia il presidente franco lho visto una sola volta siamo tutti uniti nel sentimento di dolore per la scomparsa di franco sensi
6399450 voi sapere quanto ero legato a questuomo gli devo grande gratitudine perche mi ha fatto diventare allenatore della roma il primo anno non vincevamo mai e io mi sono detto mo me caccia invece non mi ha mai cacciato ve ne rendete conto
6399451 sul piano umano aggiunge mazzone ho ricordi veramente eccezionali sono sempre rimasto legato alla sua famiglia e cera sempre una telefonata durante le feste oggi il minimo che potevo fare era venire qui per dare lultimo saluto ho il ricordo di un uomo perfetto eccezionale lo ringraziero per sempre lascio questo ricordo in eredita alla mia famiglia perche sia riconoscente verso la sua famiglia per avermi fatto allenare la roma pensate un po che regalo mi ha fatto
6399452 un uomo che ha parlato con il linguaggio della semplicita e della umanita direttamente alla gente e che rappresenta il mondo del calcio
6399453 romanista col cuore e con la mente riposa in pace valoroso presidente
6399454 e commovente il modo in cui il popolo della roma ha dato lultimo abbraccio al presidente franco sensi un abbraccio cosi commosso e paziente con un sentimento grande forte e autentico e bello che franco che ha dato tanto alla roma abbia ricevuto un tributo cosi sincero sentito e forte
6399455 grazie presidente per quel che sei stato e per tutto quello che hai fatto
6399456 io sono la resurrezione e la vita chi crede in me anche se muore vivra in eterno
6399457 il nostro cuore non ha pace finche non riposa in dio

6399461 un grande uomo e un grande presidente come franco sensi
6399462 se riusciremo a costruire questo stadio con il consenso e la spinta della societa sara il modo migliore per ricordare franco sensi
6399463 sei sempre stato vicino a noi come presidente e come secondo padre hai fatto tanto ha detto per la roma e per roma e i romani ti hanno accompagnato non lasceremo solo te ne la tua famiglia faremo di tutto ha concluso montella per farti sorridere lassu dove sei
6399464 ringrazio prima di tutti le migliaia di persone che sono rimaste fuori della chiesa per ore e sotto il sole per dare lultimo saluto a franco
6399465 non posso dimenticare che nelle mie piccole battaglie il presidente si sempre schierato al mio fianco non facendomi mai mancare il suo grande sostegno ricordo per esempio quando feci certe accuse prima ancora che scoppiasse lo scandalo di calciopoli in queste ore di grande dolore mi emozionano gli elogi e gli attestati di stima per il mio presidente giungono da tutta italia anche da quelli che non hanno fatto nulla per dimostrarsi suoi amici ma avrei preferito che qualcuno gli avesse rivolto questi elogi e lo avesse sostenuto nelle sue battaglie durante la sua presidenza quando era ancora in vita

6399497 yes possible because if inflation is going to rise interest rates are going to go up then real estate sector is going to be hit even further and the charts are also suggesting that further downside definitely likely so we can actually create short positions there
6399498 if one is not too bothered about liquidity as such the stocks liquidity then i think fundamentally a strong counter like excel crop care crop chemicals are very much a favourite for fund managers all over the world now it seems and this stock fundamentally is very sound even technically looks pretty good so one can look into this our caveat is that i personally hold the stock in my portfolio

6399503 ahora estoy contento por el esfuerzo que he realizado pensaba perder el peso lo m s r pido posible y lo he conseguido
6399504 al estilo de juego espa ol es cuesti n de tiempo
6399505 esta claro que el partido contra cuba siempre tiene elementos extra de motivaci n y tensi n pero como deportistas cuando sales al campo lo nico que tienes que hacer es jugar pelota lo mejor posible y ganar
6399506 sab amos que el enfrentamiento con cuba era algo que no se pod a evitar y por lo tanto ahora llegamos m s preparados y con el nico objetivo de conseguir la victoria
6399507 estamos molestos por la manera como se nos acus por el incidente de la lesi n de su jugador pero ahora lo nico que cuenta es estar listos para ganar y seguir camino a la ltima medalla de oro del b isbol en juegos ol mpicos
6399508 debemos demostrar que el deporte del b isbol tiene que volver a ser ol mpico
6399509 para el equipo cubano que ha ganado tres de las cuatro medallas ol mpicas conseguir el oro en pek n 2008 es algo muy emocionante ya que en principio ser la ltima vez que haya competici n de b isbol
6399510 ser un gran partido como todos los que hemos protagonizado anteriormente los dos equipos
6399511 estados unidos tiene una excelente ofensiva con buenos lanzadores y adem s poseen velocidad
6399512 lo demostramos en el primer partido sabemos como hacer las cosas y espero que al final de nuevo seamos nosotros el equipo ganador
6399513 evitar algunos imponderables si alg n club viene con una cantidad adecuada por ejemplo a falta de pocos d as para el cierre del mercado
6399514 lo mejor ser a que no saliera ning n jugador porque tenemos un equipo magn fico
6399515 no estamos esperando a vender para comprar con garant as porque en estas fechas ya es dif cil encontrar una soluci n que no pase por mucho dinero o por una cesi n no existen los chollos
6399516 estar en el primer equipo o en un club que re na las condiciones para que crezca
6399517 debe seguir con nosotros porque ha demostrado que tener 17 a os no es un impedimento para jugar en primera y ocupar la posici n de mediocentro con solvencia
6399518 there is absolutely a lack of confidence the fact is everybody in this market are playing blinkers and are looking at losses that they have suffered over the last 6 months and this is going to be a massive erosion of market capital and anybody has not made any money in the last 6 months lets accept this fact so people with deep pockets at 13 000 13 500 what mean to say is i am not trying to state that it will be the bottom i am not trying to state that it will go back to that level what i am trying to state is the level at which i am comfortable i am going to buy let the market slide a little bit more but wait for the right time may be next one to three months are going to be 10 15 higher in many scrips scrips which possibly you and me going to buy into and that is exactly what has happened just about a month ago
6399519 i am not here to predict as to what level we can fall what i am trying to state is that the level which i see i am going to enter making some money over the next 2 3 months and its only when the markets are going to start moving may be 2 3 4 6 months later and when it happens later possibly at higher levels and the retail investors who are going to get some confidence back are going to come back into the market thereby pushing up the volumes little bit more
6399520 when i see people with deep pockets what i mean is people who are having money as well as ready to wait for sometime because even look at a stock like when i say look at an interest rate sensitive kind of stock like maruti which came out with dismal results the stock came down rightly but yet at the end of it this stock was amongst those stocks which came with maximum returns in the last one month so whether it is a hdfc bank or an icici bank or may be a kotak yes bank even the hdfc itself or reliance capital if you look at the way the stocks have moved over the last 1 1 5 months and the way they have fallen in the last 4 5 days i think possibly a 3 5 fall from here and i think i am ready to look at buying into it
6399521 solo el hecho de desfilar con la bandera de tu pa s ser a algo inolvidable

6399838 i hope theyre happy surprised and that they can just realize that we wrote the best songs we could

6399876 chunga said he wanted them to stay so that they help him and also learn from him during the next six months
6399877 basically he is assisting george and dodo for the next six months but his chungas mandate is to ensure that we survive which im sure is very possible
6399878 actually im confident that we can even finish among the top eight given the resources that we have but all we want from chunga is survival anything better will be a bonus

6399883 im not worried about the other clubs my worry is gunners and thats where i will be working
